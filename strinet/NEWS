* Major changes for strinet-0.9.2.4rc1

  Release candidate for Mark Fugate.

* Major changes for strinet-0.9.2.4

  This release is a maintenance release.  It provides the following
  enhancements and fixes:

  - Added --enable-devel configure option for embedded targets.
  - Added send-pr script for automatic problem report generation.
  - Fixed buffer leak in ss_sock_sendmsg reported by John Wenker.
  - Significant rewrite of the ss_sock_sendmsg function.
  - Loader optimizations for streams-inet driver.
  - Added buffer leak checks to all testsuites (Linux Fast-STREAMS only)

* Major changes for strinet-0.9.2.3

  This release is primarily to support additional compilers (gcc 4.0.2),
  architectures (x86_64, SMP, 32-bit compatibility), recent Linux
  distributions (EL4, SuSE 10, LE2006, OpenSuSE) and kernels (2.6.15).

  This is primarily a maintenance release.  Validated for operation on
  x86_64 SMP kernel using Linux Fast-STREAMS.  Changes included to
  handle __LP64__ kernels.  Corrected build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15
  kernels as reported on mailing list.  Corrects several bugs reported
  by project sponsors.

  - Changes necessary for __LP64__ compatible builds.  Changes to
    support 32-bit ioctl compatibility for __LP64__ architectures.
    Binary compatibilty should not have been disrupted.  At the same
    time as the ioctl32 changes, TRANSPARENT ioctl support for most of
    the IO controls for the ldl(4) driver has been added.

  - Changes to satisfy gcc 4.0.2 compiler.

  - Corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean compile and test runs on
    x86_64 architecture.  Some bug corrections resulting from gcc 4.0.2
    compiler warnings.

  - Corrected build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15 kernels as reported on
    mailing list.

  - Initial corrections for and testing of SMP operation on Intel 630
    Hyper-Threaded SMP on x86_64.  This package should now run well on
    N-way Xeons even with Hyper-Threading enabled.

  - Corrections and validation of 32-bit compatibilty over 64-bit on
    x86_64.  Should apply well to other 64-bit architectures as well.

  This is a public gamma release of the package.

* Major changes for strinet-0.9.2.2

  This is primarily a bug fixes release.  This release has been verified
  (conformance test suite passes) for operation with Linux Fast-STREAMS
  (streams-0.7a.4).  Some test cases were updated because LiS was not
  operating correctly on pipes (does not send SIGPIPE on write error
  contrary to POSIX).

* Initial release strinet-0.9.2.1

  With this release version numbers were changed to reflect an upstream
  version only to be consistent with other OpenSS7 package releases.
  All `RPM' release numbers will be `-1$(PACKAGE_RPMEXTRA)' and all
  `Debian' release numbers will be `_0'.  If you wish to apply patches
  and relelease the package, please bump up the release number and apply
  a suitable release suffix for your organization.  We leave `Debian'
  release number `_1' reserved for your use, so you can still bundle the
  source in the `.dsc' file.

  Major changes for this release include build against Linux 2.6 kernels
  and popular distributions based on the 2.6 kernel as well as wider
  distribution support.  The package also supports both `LiS-2.18.1' as
  well as `streams-0.7a' on both kernels.

* Initial release strinet-0.9.2-1

  Initial autoconf/RPM packaging of the `strinet' release.

  This was an internal alpha test release and was not released publicly.
