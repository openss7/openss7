.PP
.PP
SCTP supports this XTI/TLI library call as described in
.BR t_accept (3),
with the additional considerations described here.
.PP
When the XTI/TLI user provides a transport endpoint address in
.IR call->addr ,
the address can be an array of
.B sockaddr_in
structures, each indicating a local address for the responding endpoint.
If this list of addresses does not include the destination address of the
connection indication, the set of addresses will be expanded by the SCTP
provider to include the destination address of the connection indication.
.PP
Issuing
.BR t_accept (3)
assigns an already established connection to
.IR resfd .
.PP
Since user data cannot be exchanged during the connection establishment phase,
.I call->udata.len
must be set to zero.
.PP
When
.RI ( "resfd != fd" ),
the function
.BR t_accept (3)
is recommended to be called with
.I resfd
in the
.B T_UNBND
state, though an endpoint which is bound to any local address (in the
.B T_IDLE
state) can also be used.
.PP
After
.BR t_accept (3)
completes, the endpoint
.I resfd
will represent a connected SCTP endpoint whose complete binding essentially has
both local and remote address components.
.PP
If file descriptor
.I resfd
was unbound before calling
.BR t_accept (3),
after the call completes its local address binding would be to the same
protocol address bound to
.IR fd .
If the file descriptor
.I resfd
was bound to a local address before calling
.BR t_accept (3),
that local address binding is dissolved and the local address part of the
binding after
.BR t_accept (3)
completes would become the same as the address bound to
.IR fd .
.PP
If options with end-to-end significance
.RB ( T_IP_OPTIONS ", " T_IP_TOS ", " T_SCTP_OSTREAMS ", " T_SCTP_ISTREAMS ", " T_SCTP_ECN " and " T_SCTP_ALI )
are to be sent with the connection confirmation, the values of these options
must be set with
.BR t_optmgmt (3)
prior to the
.B T_LISTEN
event occurs.  When the transport user detects a
.B T_LISTEN
event, SCTP has already established the connection.  Association-related
options passed with
.BR t_accept (3)
become effective at once, but since the connection is already established,
they are transmitted with subsequent IP datagrams sent out in the
.B T_DATAXFER
state.
.PP
SCTP provides a number of options, described in
.IR \(lqOPTIONS\(rq ,
above, that may be included in this XTI/TLI call
in the
.I call->opt
parameter to change local and end-to-end characteristics of the transport

.TP
.I T_IP_OPTIONS
.TP

This value may be changed during the transport connection using the
.I T_SCTP_RTO
option to

This value may be changed during the transport connection using the
.I T_SCTP_RTO
option to

.I T_SCTP_MAX_INIT_RETRIES
sets the maximum number of COOKIE-ACK retransmissions that will be performed
until the destination transport address is abandoned.
This value is

in other than the
.BR T_IDLE " or " T_OUTCON
states.
This value can be changed for specific connection by providing this option to the

If the provider indicates that connect data can be included in the response to
.BR t_getinfo (3),
the XTI/TLI user can provide connection data in the
.I call->udata
parameter.
.\"

.SS t_bind\fR(3)
.PP
SCTP supports this XTI/TLI library call as described in
.BR t_bind (3),
with the additional considerations described here.
.PP
When the XTI/TLI user provides a transport endpoint address in
.IR req->addr ,
the address to bind can contain multiple
.B sockaddr_in
structures, each representing a local IP address to which to bind a multi-homed
SCTP transport endpoint.
Each address in the array must have the same
.I req->addr[i].sin_family
and
.I req->addr[i].sin_port
value.
.PP
When the SCTP transport service provider returns the bound address in
.IR ret->addr ,
the address bound can contain multiple
.B sockaddr_in
structures, each representing a bound local IP address.  The SCTP conforming
transport service provider will return the same values in each
.I ret->addr[i].sin_family
and
.I ret->addr[i].sin_port
fields.
.PP
The
.BR INET (4)
implementation treats port number zero (0) as a request to bind to any
unused port.  Other than that value, the
.I req->addr.sin_port
part of the binding is specific.  The
.I req->addr.sin_addr.in_addr
part of the binding can represent a single IP address or a wildcard binding to
an address that could represent multiple IP addresses that are legal for the
host
.RB ( INADDR_ANY ).
.PP
Under recent versions of
.BR INET (4),
.BR t_bind (3)
called with a
.B NULL
.I req
argument is equivalent to binding to a wildcard port number with a wildcard IP
address.
.PP
Under
.BR INET (4),
when bound to a wildcard port or IP address, assignment of a specific port
number and IP address can be deferred until an incoming or outgoing connection
is initiated.  Under these situations, any address returned in the
.I ret
argument to
.BR t_bind (3)
or the
.I loc
argument to
.BR t_getprotaddr (3)
will return the wildcard address and port number instead of an assigned
list of addresses and port number.
Only once a connection has been established will the local address returned by
.BR t_getprotaddr (3)
be assured to be an assigned address list rather than a wildcard address.
.\"
.\"
.SS t_close\fR(3)
.PP
SCTP supports this XTI/TLI library call as described in
.BR t_close (3)
without modifications.
.PP
The
.BR t_close (3)
call will result in a
.BR close (2)
call on the descriptor of this XTI/TLI communication endpoint.  If there are no
other descriptors in this process which reference the communications endpoint,
the
.BR close (2)
call will perform an orderly connection termination according to the rules of
a TCP CLOSE call on this transport endpoint as specified in the standards
.I RFC 793
.[
rfc 793
.]
and
.IR "RFC 1122" .
.[
rfc 1122
.]
If the
.B XTI_LINGER
option is supported and is used to enable the linger option, the linger time
will affect the time an implementation lingers in the execution of
.BR t_close (3)
or
.BR close (2).
A linger time of zero (0) specified with the
.B XTI_LINGER
option may cause an abortive release of a TCP connection, resulting in lost
data.

.SS t_connect\fR(3)
.PP
SCTP supports this XTI/TLI library call as described in
.BR t_connect (3),
with the additional considerations described here.
.PP
The
.I sndcall->addr
structure specifies the remote socket.  In the present version, the returned
address set in
.I rcvcall->addr
will have the same value.  Note that the peer SCTP, and not the peer transport
user, confirms the connection.
.PP
When the XTI/TLI user provides a transport endpoint address to which to connect in
.IR sndcall->addr ,
the address can be an array of
.B sockaddr_in
structures, each indicating a remote address for the endpoint to which to
connect.
Only one address is necessary to successfully form a multi-homed transport
connection; however, if additional addresses are provided, the transport
connection is initialized in a more secure and reliable fashion.
.PP
SCTP provides a number of options, described in
.IR \(lqOPTIONS\(rq ,
above, that may be included in this XTI/TLI call
in the
.I sndcall->opt
parameter to change local ad end-to-end characteristics of the transport
endpoint accepting the connection.
The options of end-to-end significance that can be included in this XTI/TLI library
call are:
.TP
.I T_SCTP_CKSUM_TYPE
set the type of checksum to be performed on all packets for the connection.
This option is useful if the connecting XTI/TLI user is aware that the destination
transport endpoint only supports the older Adler 32 checksum.
.TP
.I T_SCTP_ISTREAMS
set the maximum number of incoming streams for the connection.  The peer must
respect this value and negotiate the number of incoming streams to be less
than or equal to this value or the transport connection will fail.
.TP
.I T_SCTP_OSTREAMS
set the requested number of outgoing streams for the connection.  The peer may
negotiate a smaller number of outgoing streams depending on its maximum
incoming stream requirements.  It is the XTI/TLI user's responsibility to check
the number of outgoing streams in the
.I rcvcall->opt
response or in the
.I call->opt
response from a call to
.BR t_rcvconnect (3).
If the negotiated number of outgoing streams is not acceptable, it is the
responsibility of the XTI/TLI user to disconnect the transport connection.
.TP
.I T_SCTP_ECN
sets whether explicit congestion notification is to be supported for the
transport connection.
.TP
.I T_SCTP_ALI
sets which adaptation layer information is to be communicated and negotiated
for the connection.  If the negotiated adaptation layer information is less
than the capabilities sent on connection request, it is the XTI/TLI user's
responsibility to check the adaptation layer information returned in the
.I rcvcall->opt
response or in the
.I call->opt
response from a call to
.BR t_rcvconnect (3).
If the negotiated capabilities is not acceptable, it is the responsibility of
the XTI/TLI user to disconnect the transport connection.
.PP
The options of local significance that can be included in this XTI/TLI call
include (other options of local significance may also be included):
.TP
.I T_SCTP_HEARTBEAT_ITVL
sets the heartbeat interval to be used on all destination addresses during the
connection.
This value can be changed during the transport connection for specific
destinations using the
.I T_SCTP_HB
option to
.BR t_optmgmt (3).
.TP
.I T_SCTP_RTO_INITIAL
sets the initial retransmission timeout for all destinations.
This value can be changed during the transport connection for specific
destinations using the
.I T_SCTP_RTO
option to
.BR t_optmgmt (3).
.TP
.I T_SCTP_RTO_MIN
sets the minimum retransmission timeout interval for all destinations.
This value can be changed during the transport connection for specific
destinations using the
.I T_SCTP_RTO
option to
.BR t_optmgmt (3).
.TP
.I T_SCTP_RTO_MAX
sets the maximum retransmission timeout interval for all destinations.
This value can be changed during the transport connection for specific
destinations using the
.I T_SCTP_RTO
option to
.BR t_optmgmt (3).
.TP
.I T_SCTP_PATH_MAX_RETRANS
sets the maximum number of times that a retransmission will be directed at a
destination adress until the destination address is deemed inactive.
This value can be changed during the transport connection for specific
destinations using the
.I T_SCTP_RTO
option to
.BR t_optmgmt (3).
.TP
.I T_SCTP_MAX_INIT_RETRIES
sets the maximum number of INIT retransmissions that will be performed until
the destination transport address is abandoned.  When multiple transport
endpoint addresses are provided to
.BR t_connect (3),
each destination transport address will be tried this many times in turn.

.TP \w'servtype\(em'u
.I addr
For compatibility with the
.BR sockets (3)
library,
.B SCTP
uses a
.B sockaddr_in
structured address.  However, a number of XTI/TLI library calls support multiple
.B sockaddr_in
address to be specified in a single call.  This size will be an integer multiple of the
size of the
.B sockaddr_in
structure size, indicating how many
.B sockaddr_in
structures can be included in a single address specification.
.TP
.I options
The maximum size of options is provider specific.  The
.B OpenSS7
SCTP implementation
.RB ( sctp (4))
returns the maximum size of an options structure containing all SCTP options.
.TP
.I tsdu
The maximum size of a transport service data unit.  For SCTP this is the
maximum size of a message, considering that it may be fragmented and sent in
multiple DATA chunks.  For
.BR sctp (4)
this value could be
.BR T_INFINITE .
SCTP
.[
RFC 2960
.]
has some limitations resulting from stream blockage due to large messages that
need to be fragmented and sent in multiple chunks.  Some implementations may
want to restrict the maximum size of a TSDU to something smaller for this
purpose.
.TP
.I etsdu
.B SCTP
supports the concept of expedited data as data that is sent unordered.  SCTP
conforming transport provides will not return
.B T_INVALID
for this field.  The maximum ETSDU size is subject to the same considerations
as the TSDU size above.  Some implementations may wish to restrict the size of
the ETSDU to smaller than the TSDU because unordered data causes more problems
with stream blocking due to fragmentation in SCTP.
.[
RFC 2960
.]
.TP
.I connect
SCTP supports the concept of connection data.  Although SCTP also supports
sending the first fragments of a TSDU or ETSDU with the COOKIE-ECHO or
COOKIE-ACK chunks, and subsequent fragements later, this value represents the
maximum size of a TSDU that can be completely contained in the COOKIE-ECHO or
COOKIE-ACK chunks.  This value will typically be substantially less than the
TSDU size above.  Implementations that do not support sending of DATA chunks
bundled with the COOKIE-ECHO or COOKIE-ACK may return
.B T_INVALID
for this field.
.sp
(Note that there is no way in TPI
.[
TPI Revision 2.0.0

to send a
.BR T_CONNECT_REQ (7)
indicated expedited data.  Therefore, it is only possible to send a TSDU with
.BR t_connect (3)
in
.BR xti (3).
.TP
.I discon
Although SCTP supports orderly release, SCTP does not support the concept of
disconnection data.  SCTP conforming transport providers will always return
.B T_INVALID
in this field.
.TP
.I servtype
SCTP supports only connection-oriented modes with orderly release.  SCTP
conforming transport service providers will return
.B T_COTS_ORD
whenever the SCTP implementation supports orderly release (i.e. SHUTDOWN and

.SS t_listen\fR(3)
.PP
SCTP supports this XTI/TLI library call as described in
.BR t_listen (3)
with the additional considerations described here.
.PP
Upon successful return
.BR t_listen (3)
indicates an existing connection and not a connection indication.  Since user
data cannot be exchanged during the connection establishment phase,
.I call->udata.maxlen
must be set to zero (0) before the call to
.BR t_listen (3).
The
.I call->addr
structure contains the remote calling socket.
.PP
.B XTI-SCTP
does not support the same semantics with regard to indication of
connections, acceptance of indicated connections, and negotiation of options
during connection establishment.  This is because the connection can be
internally accepted before an indication is given to the XTI/TLI user.  To be able
to establish proposed values of options of end-to-end significance before a
connection is accepted, the proposed values of options must be set on the
transport endpoint upon which the XTI/TLI user is listening with
.BR t_listen (3)
rather than being responded to at the time that the connection is accepted
with
.BR t_accept (3).
This makes the semantics of these XTI/TLI functions somewhat different than is
experienced for ISO/OSI conforming protocols.  This characteristic of using
XTI/TLI for internet protocols is described in XNS 5.2.

.PP
Some SCTP options of end-to-end significance should be set before a call to
.BR t_listen (3),
using
.BR t_optmgmt (3),
are as follows:
.TP
.I T_SCTP_CKSUM_TYPE
set the type of checksum to be performed on all packets for all connections
indicated on this transport endpoint.  This option is useful if the listening
XTI/TLI user is aware that the connecting transport endpoints only support the
older Adler 32 checksum.
.TP
.I T_SCTP_MAC_TYPE
sets the message authentication digest algorithm that will be used when
signing cookies that are returned to transport endpoints generating connection
indications on this transport endpoint.  This option is useful if the
listening XTI/TLI user wishes to forego or select the security/performance
trade-off associated with the generation of cookies on the transport endpoint.
.TP
.I T_SCTP_COOKIE_LIFE
sets the lifetime of cookies generated by the listening transport endpoint.
This also sets the interval of re-keying of message authentication digests.
This is useful if the listening transport endpoint is aware of the transit
delays associated with forming connections to the listening transport endpoint
and wishes to tighten or loosen the security associated with cookie lifetimes
and re-keying of message authentication digests.
.TP
.I T_SCTP_COOKIE_INC
sets the cookie increment that will be applied to connecting transport
endpoints requesting cookie preservation.
.TP
.I T_SCTP_THROTTLE_ITVL
sets the throttle interval for throttling connection attempts on the listening
transport endpoint.
.PP
In addition, any of the options described under
.BR t_accept (3),
above, may be set with
.BR t_optmgmt (3)
before the call to
.BR t_listen (3).
.PP
When an incoming connection is indicated, the calling address indicated in the
.I call->addr
argument can contain multiple
.B sockaddr_in
structures, each representing a multi-homed IP transport address from which
the connection is requested.  This first address in the list is always the
source address of the COOKIE-ECHO packet.  Each address in the array will have
the same

fields.
.PP
When an incoming connection is indicated, the options indicated in the
.I call->opt
argument that are of end-to-end significance are as follows:

.I T_SCTP_CKSUM_TYPE
indicates the checksum type that was used for the COOKIE-ECHO packet.  This
value is auto-detected.  If this checksum type is unacceptable to the XTI/TLI user,
the XTI/TLI user should refuse the connection indication using
.BR t_snddis (3),
with the indicated sequence number.
.TP
.I T_SCTP_ISTREAMS
indicates the number of incoming streams requested by the peer.  If this value
is too high, it may be adjusted using this option to the
.BR t_accept (3)
call.  This value cannot be adjusted upward.  If the value is too low, the
XTI/TLI user should refuse the connection indication using
.BR t_snddis (3),
with the indicated sequence number.
.TP
.I T_SCTP_OSTREAMS
indicates the maximum number of outgoing streams supported by the peer.  If
this value is too high, it may be adjusted downward using this option to the
.BR t_accept (3)
call.  This value cannot be adjusted upward.  If the value is too low, the
XTI/TLI user should refuse the connection indication using
.BR t_snddis (3),
with the indicated sequence number.
.TP
.I T_SCTP_ECN
indicates whether the peer supports explicit congestion notification.  The
peer cannot be compelled to use explicit congestion notification.  If explicit
congestion notification is required but not indicated, it is the XTI/TLI user's
responsibility to refuse the transport connection using
.BR t_snddis (3)
with the indicated sequence number.  Whether this transport endpoint supports
explicit congestion notification or not can be specified using this option to
the
.BR t_accept (3)
call accepting the connection indication.
.TP
.I T_SCTP_ALI
indicates whether the peer supports adaptation layer information and extension
capabilities to the SCTP protocol.  If capabilities are required that are not
indicated, it is the XTI/TLI user's responsibility to refuse the transport
connection using
.BR t_snddis (3)
with the indicated sequence number.  Whether this transport endpoint supports
adaptation layer information and which capabilities it supports can be
specified using this option to the
