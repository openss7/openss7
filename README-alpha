Package openss7-0.9.2.D.rc3 Released 2006-08-26.

This is beta release software.

The following is an extract from the Installation and Reference Manual:

5.5 Bugs
========

5.5.1 Defect Notices
--------------------

"OpenSS7 Master Package" could contain unknown defects.  This is a
"beta" release.  Some defects could be harmful.  Validation testing has
been performed by the `OpenSS7 Project' on this software for only a
restricted set of systems.  The software might fail to configure or
compile on other systems.  The `OpenSS7 Project' recommends that you do
not use this software for purposes other than validation testing and
evaluation, and then only with care. Use at your own risk.  Remember
that there is NO WARRANTY.(1)

This software is beta software.  As such, it might crash your kernel.
Installation of the software might mangle your header files or Linux
distribution in such a way as to make it unusable.  Crashes could lock
your system and rebooting the system might not repair the problem.  You
can possibly loose all the data on your system.  Because this software
might crash your kernel, the resulting unstable system could possibly
destroy computer hardware or peripherals making them unusable.  You
might void the warranty on any system on which you run this software.
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

manual.

5.5.2 Known Defects
-------------------

With the exception of packages not originaly created by the `OpenSS7
Project', the `OpenSS7 Project' software does not ship with known bugs
in any release stage except "pre-alpha".  "OpenSS7 Master Package" had
no known bugs at the time of release.

5.5.3 Defect History
--------------------

This section contains historical bugs that were encountered during
development and their resolutions.  This list serves two purposes:

  1. It captures bugs encountered between releases during development
     that could possibly reoccur (and the Moon is made of blue cheese).
     It therefore provides a place for users to look if they encounter
     a problem.

  2. It provides a low overhead bug list between releases for
     developers to use as a `TODO' list.

For a history of defects for each of the individual subpackages, see the
`Defect History' section of the `Installation and Reference Manual' for
the appropriate subpackage.

5.4.3 Beta Releases
-------------------

"Beta" releases are releases that have received some testing, but the
testing to date is not exhaustive.  "Beta" release packages do not ship
with known defects.  All known defects are resolved before
distribution; however, as exhaustive testing has not been performed,
unknown defects may exist.  The purpose for a "beta" release is to
provide a baseline for other organizations to participate in the
rigorous testing of the package.

"Beta" release packages ship containing warnings that the package has
not been exhaustively tested and that the package may cause systems to
crash.  Suitability of software in this category for production use is
not advised by the project; however, as always, is at the discretion of
the user of the software.
