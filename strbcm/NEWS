The sections that follow provide information on OpenSS7 releases of the
OpenSS7 STREAMS Binary Compatibility Modules package.

 Major changes for release strbcm-0.9.2.5
-----------------------------------------

Major features since the last internal release are as follows:

   - Kernel module license made explicit "GPL v2".  And then changed
     back to "GPL".

   - License upgrade to AGPL Version 3.

   - Ability to strap out major documentation build and installation
     primarily for embedded targets.

   - Improvements to common build process for embedded and
     cross-compile targets.


As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production
kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the `GNU Affero General Public
License Version 3'.  The release is available as an `autoconf' tarball,
SRPM, DSC, and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the downloads page
(http://www.openss7.org/download.html) for the `autoconf' tarballs,
SRPMs and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and binary RPMs and DEBs,
see the strbcm package page (http://www.openss7.org/strbcm_pkg.html).

See `http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strbcm-0.9.2.5/ChangeLog' and
`http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strbcm-0.9.2.5/NEWS' in the release
for more information.  Also, see the `strbcm.pdf' manual in the release
(also in html `http://www.openss7.org/strbcm_manual.html').

 Major changes for release strbcm-0.9.2.4
-----------------------------------------

Major features since the last internal release are as follows:

   - Support build on openSUSE 10.2.

   - Support build on Fedora 7 with 2.6.21 kernel.

   - Support build on CentOS 5.0 (RHEL5).

   - Support build on Ubuntu 7.04.

   - Updated to gettext 0.16.1.

   - Changes to support build on 2.6.20-1.2307.fc5 and
     2.6.20-1.2933.fc6 kernel.

   - Supports build on Fedora Core 6.

   - Support for recent distributions and tool chains.


 Major changes for release strbcm-0.9.2.3
-----------------------------------------

Major features since the last internal release are as follows:

   - Improvements to the common build environment with better support
     for standalone package builds on 2.4 kernels.

   - Support for autoconf 2.61, automake 1.10 and gettext 0.16.

   - Support for Ubuntu 6.10 distribution and bug fixes for i386
     kernels.

   - The package now looks for other subpackages with a version number
     as unpacked by separate tarball.


 Major changes for release strbcm-0.9.2.2
-----------------------------------------

   - Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5
     with inode diet patch set).

   - Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against
     64-bit kernel modules and drivers.  The `make installcheck' target
     will now automatically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
     compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.

   - Added versions to all library symbols.

   - Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated
     release file generation making for vastly improved and timely text
     documentation present in the release directory.

   - Dropped support for `LiS'.

   - Package will now support extended ranges of minor devices on 2.6
     kernels under `Linux Fast-STREAMS' only.

   - Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
     distributions: support for additional `SuSE' distributions on
     `ix86' as well as `x86_64'.  Added distribution support includes
     `SLES 9', `SLES 9 SP2', `SLES 9 SP3', `SLES 10', `SuSE 10.1'.

   - Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent
     `gcc' compilers and some idiosyncratic behaviour for some
     distributions (primarily SUSE).

   - Optimized compilation is now available also for user level
     programs in addition to kernel programs.  Added new
     `--with-optimize' option to `configure' to accomplish this.

   - Added `--disable-devel' `configure' option to suppress building
     and installing development environment.  This feature is for
     embedded or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
     environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).

   - Added `send-pr' script for automatic problem report generation.

 Initial release strbcm-0.9.2.1
-------------------------------

Initial autoconf/RPM packaging of the `strbcm' release.

This is the initial release of the `OpenSS7 STREAMS Binary
Compatibility Modules' package for `Linux Fast-STREAMS'.  The ability
to include pre-compiled STREAMS binaries was formerly part of the
`Linux STREAMS' package, however, as the ability is also applicable to
`Linux Fast-STREAMS', it was removed into a separate package.  Once
`Linux Fast-STREAMS' is production grade, this binary compatibility
suite will be rolled back into the streams package as `LiS' is
deprecated.
