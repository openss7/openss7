@node Pre-installation Checks
@subsection Pre-installation Checks
@cindex pre-installation checks

Most @cite{OpenSS7} packages, including the @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package, ship with
pre-installation checks integral to the build system.  Pre-installation checks include check scripts
that are shipped in the @file{scripts} subdirectory as well as specialized @command{make} targets
that perform the checks.

When building and installing the package from @dfn{RPM} or @dfn{DEB} source packages
(@pxref{Building from the Source RPM}; and @ref{Building from the Debian DSC}), a fundamental set of
post-compile, pre-installation checks are performed prior to building binary packages.  This is
performed automagically and does not require any special actions on the part of the user creating
binary packages from source packages.

When building and installing the package from @dfn{tarball} (@pxref{Building from the Tar Ball}; and
@ref{Installing the Tar Ball}), however, pre-installation checks are only performed if specifically
invoked by the builder of the package.  Pre-installation checks are invoked after building the
package and before installing the package.  Pre-installation checks are performed by invoking the
@samp{check} or @samp{check.log} target to @command{make} when building the package, as shown
in @ref{testsuite:ex0}.

@cartouche
@float Example,testsuite:ex1
@caption{@emph{Invoking Pre-Installation Checks}}
@example
% wget http://www.openss7.org/@-@value{PACKAGE}@--@value{VERSION}@-.tar@-.bz2
% tar -xjvf @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}.tar.bz2
% pushd @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}
% ./configure
% make
% make check  # <------- invoke pre-installation checks
% popd
@end example
@end float
@end cartouche

Pre-installation checks fall into two categories: @dfn{System Checks} and @dfn{Maintenance Checks}.

@subsubsection Pre-Installation System Checks

@dfn{System Checks} are post-compilation checks that can be performed before installing the package
that check to ensure that the compiled objects function and will be successfully installed.  When
the @option{--enable-maintainer-mode} option has not been passed to @command{configure}, only
@dfn{System Checks} will be performed.

For example, the steps shown in @ref{testsuite:ex1} will perform @dfn{System} checks.

@cartouche
@float Example,testsuite:ex1
@caption{@emph{Invoking System Checks}}
@example
% wget http://www.openss7.org/@-@value{PACKAGE}@--@value{VERSION}@-.tar@-.bz2
% tar -xjvf @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}.tar.bz2
% pushd @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}
% ./configure
% make
% make check  # <------ invokes System pre-installation checks
% popd
@end example
@end float
@end cartouche

@subsubsection Pre-Installation Maintenance Checks

@dfn{Maintenance Checks} include all @dfn{System Checks}, but also checks to ensure that the kernel
modules, applications programs, header files, development tools, test programs, documentation,
and manual pages conform to @dfn{OpenSS7} standards.  When the @option{--enable-maintainer-mode}
option has been passed to @command{configure}, @dfn{Maintenance Checks} will be performed.

For example, the steps shown in @ref{testsuite:ex2} will perform @dfn{Maintenance} checks.

@cartouche
@float Example,testsuite:ex2
@caption{@emph{Invoking Maintenace Checks}}
@example
% wget http://www.openss7.org/@-@value{PACKAGE}@--@value{VERSION}@-.tar@-.bz2
% tar -xjvf @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}.tar.bz2
% pushd @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}
% ./configure --enable-maintainer-mode
% make
% make check  # <------ invokes Maintenance pre-installation checks
% popd
@end example
@end float
@end cartouche


@subsubsection Specific Pre-Installation Checks

A number of check scripts are provided in the @file{scripts} subdirectory of the distribution that
perform both @dfn{System} and @dfn{Maintenance} checks.  These are as follows:

@table @command
@item check_commands

This check performs both @dfn{System} and @dfn{Maintainance} checks.

When performing @dfn{System} tests, the following tests are performed:

Unless cross-compiling, or unless a program is included in @code{AM_INSTALLCHECK_STD_OPTIONS_EXEMPT}
every program in @code{bin_PROGRAMS}, @code{sbin_PROGRAMS}, and @code{libexec_PROGRAMS} is tested to
ensure that the @option{--help}, @option{--version}, and @option{--copying} options are accepted.
When cross-compiling is is not possible to execute cross-compiled binaries, and these checks are
skpped in that case.

Script executables, on the other hand, can be executed on the build host, so, unless listed in
@code{AM_INSTALLCHECK_STD_OPTIONS_EXEMPT}, every program in @code{dist_bit_SCRIPTS},
@code{dist_sbin_SCRIPTS}, and @code{pkglibexec_SCRIPTS} are tested to ensure that the
@option{--help}, @option{--version}, and @option{--copying} options are accepted.

When performing @dfn{Maintenance} tests, @command{check_commands} also checks to ensure that a
manual page exists in section 1 for every executable binary or script that will be installed from
@code{bin_PROGRAMS} and @code{dist_bin_SCRIPTS}.  It also checks to ensure that a manual page exists
in section 8 for every executable binary or script that wil be installed from @code{sbin_PROGRAMS},
@code{dist_sbin_SCRIPTS}, @code{libexec_PROGRAMS}, and @code{pkglibexec_SCRIPTS}.

@item check_decls

This check only performs @dfn{Maintenance} checks.

It collects the results from the @code{check_libs}, @code{check_modules} and @code{check_headers}
check scripts and tests to ensure every declaration of a function prototype or external variable
contained in installed header files has a corresponding exported symbol from either a to be
installed shared object library or a to be installed kernel module.  Declarations are exempted from
this requirement if their identifiers have been explicitly added to the @code{EXPOSED_SYMBOL}
variable.  If @code{WARN_EXCESS} is set to @samp{yes}, then the check script will only warn when
excess declarations exist (without a corresponding exported symbol); otherwise, the check script
will generate an error and the check will fail.

@item check_headers

This check only performs @dfn{Maintenance} checks.

When performing @dfn{Maintenance} tests, it identifies all of the declarations included in to be
installed header files.  It then checks to ensure that a manual page exists in sections 2, 3, 7 or
9, as appropriate, for the type of declaration.  It also checks to see if a manual page source file
exists in the source directory for a declaration that has not been included in the distribution.
Function or prototype declarations that do not have a manual page in sections 2, 3, or 9 will cause
the check to fail.  Other declarations (variable, externvar, macro, enumerate, enum, struct, union,
typedef, member, etc.) will only warn if a manual page does not exist, but will not fail the check.

@item check_libs

This check only performs @dfn{Maintenance} checks.

When performing @dfn{Maintenance} tests, it checks that each exported symbol in each to be installed
shared object library has a manual page in section 3.  It also checks that each exported symbol has
a function, prototype or externvar declaration in the to be installed header files.  A missing
declaration or manual page will cause this check to fail.

@item check_mans

This check only performs @dfn{Maintenance} checks.

When performing @dfn{Maintenance} tests, it checks that to be install manual pages can be formatted
for display without any errors or warnings from the build host @command{man} program.  It also
checks that required headings exist for manual pages according to the section in which the manual
page will be installed.  It warns if recommended headings are not included in the manual pages.
Because some @dfn{RPM} distributions have manual pages that might conflict with the package manual
pages, this check script also checks for conflicts with installed manual pages on the build host.
This check script also checks to ensure that all to be installed manual pages are used in some
fashion, that is, they have a declaration, or exported symbol, or are the name of a kernel module or
STREAMS module or driver, possibly capitalized.

Note that checking for conflicts with the build host should probably be included in the @dfn{System}
checks (because @dfn{System} checks are performed before the source @dfn{RPM} @code{%install}
scriptlet).

@item check_modules

This check performs both @dfn{System} and @dfn{Maintenance} checks.

When performing @dfn{System} tests, it checks each to be installed kernel module to ensure that all
undefined symbols can be resolved to either the kernel or another module.  It also checks whether an
exported or externally declared symbol conflicts with an exported or externally declared symbol
present in the kernel or another module.@footnote{This particular check has caught some namespace
polution that has occurred in the 2.6.11 kernel.}

When performing @dfn{Maintenance} tests, this check script tests that each to be installed kernel
module has a manual page in section 9 and that each exported symbol that does not begin with an
underscore, and that belongs to an exported function or exported variable, has a manual page in
section 9.  It also checks to ensure that each exported symbol that does not begin with an
underscore, and that blongs to an exported function or exported variable, has a function, prototype
or externvar declaration in the to be installed header files.

@item check_streams

This check performs only @dfn{Maintenance} checks.

When performing @dfn{Maintenance} tests, it checks that for each configured @dfn{STREAMS} module or
driver, or device node, that a manual page exists in section 4 or section 7 as appropriate.

@end table

The output of the pre-installation tests are fairly self explanatory.  Each check script saves some
output to @file{@emph{name}.log}, where @emph{name} is the name of the check script as listed above.
A summary of the results of the test are display to standard output and can also be captured to the
@file{check.log} file if the @samp{check.log} target is used instead of the @samp{check}
target to @command{make}.

Because the check scripts proliferate @file{@emph{name}.log} files throughout the build directory, a
@samp{make check-clean} @command{make} target has be provided to clean them out.  @samp{make
check-clean} should be run before each successive run of @samp{make check}.

@node Post-installation Checks
@subsection Post-installation Checks
@cindex post-installation checks

@menu
* Running Test Suites::		Running Test Suites in the package
@end menu

Most OpenSS7 packages ship with a combatibility and conformance test suite built using the
@samp{autotest} capabilities of @samp{autoconf 2.59}.  These test suites act as a wrapper for the
compatibility and conformance test programs that are shipped with the package.

Unlike the pre-installation checks, the post-installation checks are always run complete.  The only
check that post-installation test scripts perform is to test whether they have been invoked with
root privileges or not.  When invoked as root, or as a plain user, some tests might be skipped that
require root privileges, or that require plain user privileges, to complete successfully.

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Running Test Suites
@subsubsection Running Test Suites
@cindex test suites, running

There are several ways of invoking the conformance test suites:

@enumerate

@item The test suites can be run after installation of the package by invoking the @samp{make
installcheck} or @samp{make installcheck.log} target.  Some packages require that root privileges be
acquired before invoking the package.

@item The test suites can be run from the distribution subdirectory after installation of the
package by invoking the @command{testsuite} shell script directly.

@item The test suites can be run standalone from the @file{libexec} (@file{@value{_libexecdir}})
installation directory by invoking the @command{testsuite} shell script directly.

@end enumerate

Typical steps for invoking the testsuites directly from @command{make} are shown in
@ref{testsuite:ex3}.

@cartouche
@float Example,testsuite:ex3
@caption{@emph{Invoking System Checks}}
@example
% wget http://www.openss7.org/@-@value{PACKAGE}@--@value{VERSION}@-.tar@-.bz2
% tar -xjvf @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}.tar.bz2
% pushd @value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}
% ./configure
% make
% make check  # <------ invokes System pre-installation checks
% make install
% sudo make installcheck # <------- invokes post-installation tests
% popd
@end example
@end float
@end cartouche

When performing post-installation checks for the purposes of generating a problem report, the checks
should always be performed from the build directory, either with @samp{make installcheck} or by
invoking @command{testsuite} directly from the @file{tests} subdirectory of the build directory.
This ensures that all of the information known to @command{configure} and pertinent to the
configuration of the system for which a test case failed, will be collected in the resulting
@file{testsuite.log} file depositied upon test suite failure in the @file{tests} directory.  This
@file{testsuite.log} file can then be attached as part of the problem report and provides rich
details to maintainers of the package.

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Problem Reports
@section Problem Reports
@cindex problem reports
@cindex bugs, reporting
@cindex reporting bugs

Problem reports in the following categories should include a log file as indicated in the table
below:

@table @samp

@item ./configure
A problem with the configuration process occurs that causes the @samp{./configure} command to fail.
The problem report must include the @file{config.log} file that was generated by
@command{configure}.

@item make compile.log
A problem with the build process occurs that causes the @samp{make} command to fail.  Perform
@samp{make clean} and then @samp{make compile.log} and attach the @file{config.log} and
@file{compile.log} files to the problem report.

@item make check.log
A problem occurs with the @samp{make check} target that causes it to fail.  Perform @samp{make
check-clean check.log} and attach the @file{config.log}, @file{compile.log} and @file{check.log}
files to the problem report.

@item sudo make install.log
A problem occurs with @samp{sudo make install} that causes it to fail.  Perform @samp{sudo make
uninstall} and @samp{sudo make install.log} and attach the @file{config.log}, @file{compile.log},
@file{check.log}, and @file{install.log} files to the problem report.

@item [sudo] make installcheck
A problem occurs with the @samp{make installcheck} target that causes the test suite to fail.
Attach the resulting @file{tests/testsuite.log} file to the problem report.  There is no need to
attach the other files as they are included in @file{tests/testsuite.log}.

@end table

For other problems that occur during the use of the @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package, please
write a test case for the test suite that recreates the problem if one does not yet exist and
provide a test program patch with the problem report.  Also include whatever log files are generated
by the kernel (@code{cmn_err(9)}) or by the @command{strerr(8)} or @command{strace(1)} facilities
(@code{strlog(9)}).
