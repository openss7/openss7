Package strtty-0.9.2.1 was released under GPLv2 2007-01-07.

The OpenSS7 STREAMS Terminals package provides STREAMS modules and
drivers, libraries, programs, init scripts, and daemons that implement
the classical SVR 4 Terminal Subsystem.

The OpenSS7 STREAMS Terminals package includes kernel modules, SVR 4.2
STREAMS drivers, modules, libraries, utilities, test programs, daemons,
and development environment for the development and execution of OpenSS7
STREAMS Terminals components and applications for the SVR 4.2 STREAMS
environment.  It provides true STREAMS-based Pseudo-Terminals for Linux.

The package builds and installs the following STREAMS kernel modules and
drivers:

     - `streams_pty.ko' driver "/dev/ptmx" "/dev/pts/0"
     - `streams_ptem.ko' module "ptem"
     - `streams_pckt.ko' module "pckt"
     - `streams_ldterm.ko' module "ldterm"
     - `streams_ttcompat.ko' module "ttcompat"

pty(4)
     The pty(4) driver is a Pseudo-Terminal Driver that provides the
     classical UNIX(R) master and slave pseudo-terminals.

     This driver is complete but untested.

ptem(4)
     The ptem(4) module is a Pseudo-Terminal Emulation Module that
     provide hardware terminal emulation for the slave side of a
     Pseudo-Terminal provided by the pty(4) driver.  This module is
     pushed over the slave side of a pseudo-terminal before pusing
     ldterm(4).

     This module is complete but untested.

pckt(4)
     The pckt(4) module is a Packet Module.  This is the classical
     UNIX(R) packetization module that is pushed over the master side of
     a pseudo-terminal to allow the master to view the detailed state of
     the pseudo-terminal.

     This module is complete but untested.

ldterm(4)
     The ldterm(4) module is a Line Discipline Terminal Module.  This is
     the classical UNIX(R) line discipline module for terminals.  This
     module is pushed last on the slave side of a psuedo-terminal, after
     ptem(4) and provides the POSIX terminal interface to the user.

     This module is incomplete.

ttcompat(4)
     The ttcompat(4) module is a TTY Compatibility Module.  This is a
     module that provides UNIX(R) Version 7 and 4BSD compatible terminal
     interfaces.  These interfaces are no longer in use and this module
     has only marginal value.

     This module is complete but untested.


The package builds and installs the following shared object libraries:

libtty(3)
     The libtty(3) library provides replacements for POSIX terminal
     handling functions that are not properly implemented in glibc.
     These functions are:

     openpt(3tty)    - open a master pseudo-terminal
     ptsname(3tty)   - obtain name for slave device
     grantpt(3tty)   - grant access to the slave device
     unlockpt(3tty)  - unlock the pseudo-terminal

     This library is incomplete.

The OpenSS7 STREAMS Terminals package includes kernel modules, SVR 4.2
STREAMS drivers, modules, libraries, utilities, test programs, daemons,
and development environment for the development and execution of OpenSS7
STREAMS Terminals components and applications for the SVR 4.2 STREAMS
environment.

This package is currently incomplete.  It is being released as a
reference point for the community.  If you are interested in completion
of this package, contact <info@openss7.com>.

This is the first separate release from The OpenSS7 Project of the
OpenSS7 STREAMS Terminals package.  This package provides pts and ptm
pseudo-terminal drivers, as well as an ldterm module.  Additional
modules are the ptem, ttcompat and pckt modules.  The package contains
all the necessary manual pages and other documentation for terminal and
pseudo-terminal components in a separate autoconf tarball.

This release is the initial public release.

   - In this inital release, the package already supports a wide range
     of production distributions as it uses the same build environment
     as other OpenSS7 Project packages.

   - Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5
     with inode diet patchset).

_This is the initial public alpha release of the package.  Please see
README-alpha in the release, or `Maturity', in the manual._

This is the inital public alpha release of the package.  This package is
currently incomplete.  It is being released as a reference point for the
community.  If you are interested in completion of this package, contact
<info@openss7.com>.

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production kernels
without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the `GNU General Public License
Version 2'.  The release is available as an autoconf tarball, SRPM, DSC,
and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the downloads page
(http://www.openss7.org/download.html) for the autoconf tarballs, SRPMs
and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and binary RPMs and DEBs, see the
strtty package page (http://www.openss7.org/strtty_pkg.html).

See http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strtty-0.9.2.1/ChangeLog and
http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/strtty-0.9.2.1/NEWS in the release for
more information.  Also, see the `strtty.pdf' manual in the release
(also in html http://www.openss7.org/strtty_manual.html).
