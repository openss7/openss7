The following is an extract from the manual to assist CVS developers:

6.1.6 Downloading from CVS
--------------------------

If you are a subscriber or sponsor of The OpenSS7 Project
(http://www.openss7.org/) with CVS archive access privileges then you
can download release, mid-release or release candidate versions of the
`strtty' package from the project CVS archive.

The OpenSS7 STREAMS Terminals package is located in the
`strtty' module of `/var/cvs'.  For release tag information, see
`Releases', in the manual.

To access the archive from the project CVS pserver, use the following
commands to check out a version from the archive:

     % export CVSROOT='-d:pserver:USERNAME@cvs.openss7.com:2401/var/cvs'
     % cvs login
     Password: *********
     % cvs co -r strtty_0.9.2.2 strtty
     % cvs logout

It is, of course, possible to check out by date or by other criteria.
For more information, see `cvs(1)'.

 Preparing the CVS Working Directory
....................................

Although public releases of the `strtty' package do not require
reconfiguration, creating a configurable directory from the CVS archive
requires tools not normally distributed with the other releases.

The build host requires the following GNU tools:

   * `autoconf 2.61'

   * `automake 1.9.6'

   * `libtool 1.5.22'

   * `gettext 0.16'

It should be stressed that, in particular, the `autoconf(1)', and `automake(1)',
must be at version releases `2.61' and `1.9.6'.  _The versions normally
distributed in some mainstream GNU/Linux distributions are, in fact,
much older than these versions._(1)  GNU version of these packages
configured and installed to default directories will install in
`/usr/local/' allowing them to coexist with distribution installed
versions.

For building documentation, the build host also requires the following
documentation tools:

   * `gs 8.15'

   * `tetex 3.0'

   * `texinfo 4.8'

   * `transfig 3.2.5'

   * `imagemagick 6.2.4'

   * `groff 1.17.2'

Most desktop GNU/Linux distributions will have these tools; however,
some server-style installations (e.g. `Ubuntu'-server or `SLES 9') will
not and they must be installed separately.

For uncooked manual pages, the entire `groff(1)' package is required on
`Debian' and `Ubuntu' systems (the base package does not include `grefer(1)'
which is used extensively by uncooked manual pages).  The following
will get what you need:

     Debian: % apt-get install groff_ext
     Ubuntu: % apt-get install groff

In addition, the build host requires a complete tool chain for
compiling for the target host, including kernel tools such as `genksyms(8)'
and others.

If you wish to package `rpms' on an `rpm(1)' system, or `debs' on a `dpkg(1)'
system, you will need the appropriate tool chain.  Systems based on `rpm(1)'
typically have the necessary tool chain available, however, `dpkg(1)'
systems do not.  The following on a `Debian' or `Ubuntu' system will
get what you need:

     % apt-get install debhelper
     % apt-get install fakeroot

To generate a configuration script and the necessary scriptlets
required by the GNU `autoconf(1)' system, execute the following
commands on the working directory:

     % autoreconf -fiv strtty

where, `strtty' is the name of the directory to where the working copy
was checked out under the previous step.  This command generates the
`configure' script and other missing pieces that are normally
distributed with the release Tar Balls, SRPMs and DSCs.

Make sure that `autoreconf --version' returns `2.59'.  Otherwise, you
may need to perform something like the following:

     % PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
     % autoreconf -fiv strtty

After reconfiguring the directory, the package can then be configured
and built using the same instructions as are used for the Tar Ball, see
`Configuring the Tar Ball', in the manual, and `Building from the Tar
Ball', in the manual.

Do note, however, that `make(1)' will rebuild the documentation that is
normally released with the package.  Additional tools may be necessary
for building the documentation.  To avoid building and installing the
documentation, use the `--disable-devel' option to configure described
in `Configuring the Tar Ball', in the manual.

When configuring the package in a working directory and while working a
change-compile-test cycle that involves configuration macros or
documentation, I find it of great advantage to invoke the GNU
`configure' options `--enable-maintainer-mode',
`--enable-dependency-tracking' and `--disable-devel'.  The first of
these three options will add maintainer-specific targets to any
generated `Makefile', the second option will invoke automatic
dependency tracking within the `Makefile' so rebuilds after changes to
macro, source or documentation files will be automatically rebuilt; and
the last option will suppress rebuilding and reinstalling documentation
manual pages and header files.  Header files will still be available
under the `/usr/src' directory.
