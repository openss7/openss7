The sections that follow provide information on OpenSS7 releases of the
OpenSS7 XTI/TLI Networking package.

 Major changes for release strxnet-0.9.2.9.rc3
----------------------------------------------

   * Added Network Services Library containing network selection
     facility as well as name-to-address mapping functions ala ONC RPC.

   * Automated release file generation making for vastly improved and
     timely text documentation present in the release directory.

   * Dropped support for `LiS'.

   * Package will now support extended ranges of minor devices on 2.6
     kernels under `Linux Fast-STREAMS' only.

   * This release candidate provides support for additional SuSE
     distributions on ix86 as well as x86_64.  Added distribution
     support includes SLES 9, SLES 9 SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE
     10.1.

   * Added `--enable-devel' `configure' option for embedded targets.

   * Added `send-pr' script for automatic problem report generation.

 Major changes for release strxnet-0.9.2.8
------------------------------------------

This release is primarily to support additional compilers (gcc 4.0.2),
architectures (x86_64, SMP, 32-bit compatibility), recent Linux
distributions (EL4, SuSE 10, LE2006, OpenSuSE) and kernels (2.6.15).

This is primarily a maintenance release.  Validated for operation on
x86_64 SMP kernel using Linux Fast-STREAMS.  Changes included to handle
__LP64__ kernels.  Corrected build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15 kernels
as reported on mailing list.  Corrects one bug from inspection.

   * Changes necessary for __LP64__ compatible builds.  Changes to
     support 32-bit ioctl compatibility for __LP64__ architectures.
     Binary compatibilty should not have been disrupted.  At the same
     time as the ioctl32 changes, TRANSPARENT ioctl support for most of
     the IO controls for the ldl(4) driver has been added.

   * Changes to satisfy gcc 4.0.2 compiler.

   * Corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean compile and test runs
     on x86_64 architecture.  Some bug corrections resulting from gcc
     4.0.2 compiler warnings.

   * Corrected build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15 kernels as reported on
     mailing list.

   * Initial corrections for and testing of SMP operation on Intel 630
     Hyper-Threaded SMP on x86_64.  This package should now run well on
     N-way Xeons even with Hyper-Threading enabled.

   * Corrections and validation of 32-bit compatibilty over 64-bit on
     x86_64.  Should apply well to other 64-bit architectures as well.

This is a public gamma release of the package.

 Major changes for release strxnet-0.9.2.7
------------------------------------------

This is primarily a bug fixes release.  This release has been verified
(conformance test suite passes) for operation with Linux Fast-STREAMS
(streams-0.7a.4).  Some test cases were updated because LiS was not
operating correctly on pipes (does not send SIGPIPE on write error
contrary to POSIX).

 Major changes for release strxnet-0.9.2.6
------------------------------------------

With this release version numbers were changed to reflect an upstream
version only to be consistent with other OpenSS7 package releases.  All
`RPM' release numbers will be `-1$(PACKAGE_RPMEXTRA)' and all `Debian'
release numbers will be `_0'.  If you wish to apply patches and
relelease the package, please bump up the release number and apply a
suitable release suffix for your organization.  We leave `Debian'
release number `_1' reserved for your use, so you can still bundle the
source in the `.dsc' file.

Major changes for this release include build against Linux 2.6 kernels
and popular distributions based on the 2.6 kernel as well as wider
distribution support.  The package also supports both `LiS-2.18.1' as
well as `streams-0.7a' on both kernels.

Removed `XNS' kernel modules, header files and documentation to a
separate `strxns-0.9.2-1' package and `INET' kernel modules, header
files and documentation to a separate `strinet-0.9.2-1' package.

 Major changes for release strxnet-0.9.2-5
------------------------------------------

Dropped RPM epoch to 0 from 1 in preparation for RPM release.  Bumped
RPM release to 5.

Minor corrections: made `SCTP' manpages conditional on `OpenSS7 SCTP'
kernel.

Updated documentation and provided improvements to build process
applied to other packages.  This includes improvements to creation of
`info' and `pdf' manuals.  Update `tirdwr' and `timod' manpage.

Removed INET package from `strxnet-0.9.2-5' release.  This has now been
moved to the `strxns-0.9.2'(1) package.  Removed XNS header files and
manual pages for CDI, DLPI and NPI to that package.  Also removed
`test-inet_raw', `test-inet_udp' and `test-inet_tcp' test programs to
that package.  Removed `/dev/inet' driver to that package.  Stripped
out the -dev- RPM subpackage as there are no devices left in the
package.  Adjusted the virtual package provides naming to a more
rational approach.  Adjusted kernel module installation process to
accomodate.

Genksyms now generates kernels symbols for all combinations of SMP and
CONFIG_REGPARM kernels allowing a single modversions header file.
Improved manpages `automake' file fragment (`am/man.am') to accomodate
top-level manual pages (this was really for the `netperf' release).

 Major changes for release strxnet-0.9.2-4
------------------------------------------

Changes to compile, install.  Now builds rpms for `Fedora Core 1
(FC1)', `Whitebox Enterprise Linux (WBEL)' and `RedHat Enterprise Linux
(EL3)'.

Included explicit epoch in internal dependencies in `.spec' file for
RPM versions 4.2.1, 4.2.2 and higher.  Added hugemem kernel detection
and moved `getpmsg' and `putpmsg' manual pages.

Correction to symbolic linking and system map file location during
non-rpm `autoconf' installation.

Correction to zero maxlen behavior in `t_rcvconnect()'.

 Major changes for release strxnet-0.9.2-3
------------------------------------------

Added check for CONFIG_REGPARM, addition of `-mregparm=3' CFLAGS,
addition of `regparm_' prefix for exported kernel symbols.

Minor corrections to separate build directory install of devices and
caching of detected kernel symbols.

Added an option for suppression of exported symbol versioning
(`--without-modversions').

 Major changes for release strxnet-0.9.2-2
------------------------------------------

A couple of corrections to the build process reported by Gurol.
Changed order of build in `make rebuild' target to build tools last so
that the rpm debug package is build correctly on `RedHat 9'.

Changed MODULE_PARM to static so that `make install-strip' does not
strip module parameter symbols.

 Initial release strxnet-0.9.2-1
--------------------------------

Initial autoconf/RPM packaging of the `strxnet' release.
