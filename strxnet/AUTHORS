 Spam
.....

To avoid spam being sent to the members of the `OpenSS7' mailing
list(s), we have blocked mail from non-subscribers.  Please subscribe
to the mailing list before attempting to post to them.  (Attempts to
post when not subscribed get bounced.)

As an additional measure against spam, subscriber lists for all
`OpenSS7' mailing lists are not accessible to non-subscribers; for most
lists subscriber  lists are only accessible to the list administrator.
This keeps your mailing address from being picked off our website by
bulk mailers.

 Acceptable Use Policy
......................

It is acceptable to post professional and courteous messages regarding
the `OpenSS7' package or any general information or questions
concerning "STREAMS", "SS7", "SIGTRAN", "SCTP" or telecommunications
applications in general.

 Large Attachments
..................

The mailing list is blocked from messages of greater than `40k'.   If
you have attachments (patches, test programs, etc.) and you mail them
to the list, it will bounce to the list administrator.  If you are
interested in  making your patches, test programs, test results or other
large attachments available to the members of the mailing list, state
in the message that you would like them posted and the list
administrator will place them in the mail archives.
