@subsubheading NAME

@strong{t_accept} - accept a connection request

@subsubheading SYNOPSIS
@example
#include <xti.h>

int t_accept(int @var{fd}, int @var{resfd}, struct t_call *@var{call});
@end example

@subsubheading ARGUMENTS
@table @var
@item fd
the transport endpoint upon which a connection indication was received.

@item resfd
the transport endpoint upon which to accept the connection.

@item call
a pointer to a t_call structure containing information about the responding
endpoint and any data to be transferred in response.
@end table

@subsubheading DESCRIPTION
The @var{fd} argument is an integer file descriptor specifying the stream upon
which a previous connection indication was received with t_listen(3), and for
which the connection indication is to now be accepted.

The @var{resfd} argument is an integer file descriptor specifying the stream
upon which to accept the transport connection. @var{resfd} can be the same as
@var{fd} or different. When @var{resfd} is different from @var{fd}, the caller
specifies that the connection is to be accepted on the stream associated with
@var{resfd}. When @var{resfd} is different from @var{fd}, the stream
associated with @var{resfd} must be an XTI/TLI[1..3] stream on the same
transport provider that is either in the @code{T_UNBND} state, or is in the
@code{T_IDLE} state and bound to the same address as the responding address.

@vindex T_IDLE
@vindex T_UNBND

The @var{call} argument is a pointer to a t_call structure, specifying the
responding address, @var{addr}, the response options, @var{opt}, and any response user
data, @var{udata}. format­ ted as follows:

@example
struct t_call @{
        struct netbuf addr;             /* address */
        struct netbuf opt;              /* options */
        struct netbuf udata;            /* data */
        int sequence;                   /* identification */
@};
@end example

The @var{addr}, @var{opt} and @var{udata} members of the t_call structure are netbuf(3)
structures, each formatted as follows:

@example
struct netbuf @{
        unsigned int maxlen;            /* max length */
        unsigned int len;               /* current length */
        char *buf;                      /* data */
@};
@end example

@table @var
@item addr
A netbuf(3) structure that specifies the responding address. The responding
address is the address accepting the connection.
@code{@var{call}->addr.maxlen} is set to zero (0) by the caller and ignored by
the provider.  @code{@var{call}->addr.len} is set to the length of the
responding address.  If the length of the responding address is zero (0) then
the destination address of the connection indication is used as the responding
address.  @code{@var{call}->addr}.  @var{buf} points to the responding
address.

@item opt
A netbuf(3) structure that specifies the responding options. The responding
options can be both end-to-end and local transport options.
@code{@var{call}->opt.maxlen} is set to zero (0) by the caller and is ignored
by the provider.  @code{@var{call}->opt.len} is set to the length of the
options. If the length of the responding options is zero (0) no options are
specified.  @code{@var{call}->opt.buf} points to the options.

@item udata
A netbuf(3) structure that specifies the data to send with the connection
response. @code{@var{call}->udata.maxlen} is set to zero (0) by the caller and
is ignored by the provider. @code{@var{call}->udata.len} is set to the length
of the data. If the length of the data is zero (0) no data is included in the
response message.  @code{@var{call}->udata.buf} points to the data.

@item sequence
specifies a sequence number of the connection indication that is to be
accepted. This value was returned by a previous @var{call} to t_lis­ ten(3).
@end table

@subsubheading CAVEATS
t_accept() is only valid in state @code{T_INCON} with an out­ standing number
of connection indications greater than zero (0).

@vindex T_INCON

t_accept() is only valid for transport service providers of service type
@code{T_COTS} or @code{T_COTS_ORD}.

@vindex T_COTS
@vindex T_COTS_ORD

@subsubheading RETURN VALUE
Upon success, t_accept() returns zero (0). Upon failure, t_accept() returns -1
and sets t_errno(3) to an appropriate error number.

@subsubheading ERRORS
When t_accept() fails, it returns -1 and sets t_errno(3) to an appropriate
error number as follows:

@vtable @error
@item TACCES
The caller did not have sufficient permissions to accept a connection on the
@var{resfd} file descriptor, or did not have sufficient permissions to use the
responding address specified in @code{@var{call}->addr}.  

@item TBADADDR
The address specified was of an invalid format or contained invalid
information. This error is returned from the transport service provider.

@item TBADDATA
The amount of data specified for the @var{call} and underlying transport
service provider was invalid (i.e. was outside the protocol limits). See
t_getinfo(3) and t_open(3) for more information.

@item TBADF
The @var{fd} or @var{resfd} file descriptor was invalid.

@item TBADOPT
The options specified were of an invalid for­ mat or contained invalid
information. This error is returned from the transport service provider.  See
t_optmgmt(3) for more information on option formats.

@item TBADSEQ
The sequence number provided was invalid, or is not associated with an
outstanding connection indication.

@item TINDOUT
The file descriptor @var{resfd} has outstanding connection indications.

@item TLOOK
An asynchronous event occurred before the @var{call} could complete. See
t_look(3) for more information.

@item TNOTSUPPORT
The @var{call} requires the use of a TLI primitive not supported by the
underlying transport provider.

@item TOUTSTATE
The @var{call} was issued with the interface in an incorrect state.

@item TPROTO
A protocol error occurred between the XTI library and the underlying transport
provider.

@item TPROVMISMATCH
The transport provider associated with @var{resfd} is not the same as the
transport provider associated with @var{fd}.

@item TRESADDR
The file descriptor @var{resfd} was bound to a different address than the
responding address.

@item TRESQLEN
The file descriptor @var{resfd} is listening (i.e. it was bound with a
@var{qlen} > 0).

@vindex qlen

@item TSYSERR
A Linux system error occurred and the Linux error number is set in errno(3).

@subsection t_addleaf
@fnindex t_addleaf

@subsubheading NAME
@emph{t_addleaf} - add a point to a point to multi-point connection

@subsubheading SYNOPSIS
@example
#include <@file{xti.h}>

int t_addleaf(int @var{fd}, int @var{leafid}, struct netbuf *@var{addr});
@end example

@subsubheading ARGUMENTS
@table @var
@item fd
the transport endpoint to which to add a leaf.

@item leafid
the identifier for the leaf.

@item addr
a pointer to a netbuf(3) structure containing the address of the leaf.
@end table

@subsubheading DESCRIPTION
Requests that an endpoint be added to a point to multi-point connection.

@var{fd} is the file descriptor of the local transport endpoint.

@var{leafid}  is  a transport user assigned integer value which will be used
to identify the point added to the point to multi-point connection in
subsequent interactions with the transport user.

@var{addr} is a netbuf(3) structure specifying on call the address of the
local point being  added  to  the point  to multi-point connection.  No
information is returned in @var{addr}.  @samp{@var{addr}->maxlen} is ignored
by the call.  @samp{@var{addr}->len} is the length of the address.  If
@samp{@var{addr}->len} is zero, it indicates that no  address  is provided.
@samp{@var{addr}->buf} is a pointer to the user buffer containing the address.

@subsubheading CAVEATS
@emph{t_addleaf()} is only valid in the @dfn{T_DATAXFER} state.

@emph{t_addleaf()}  is  only valid for transport service providers of service
type @dfn{T_COTS} or @dfn{T_COTS_ORD} that support point to multi-point
connection management.

In synchronous mode, @emph{t_addleaf()} blocks until a leaf  change
confirmation  is  received.   In  asynchronous  mode where no leaf change
confirmation is immediately available, @emph{t_addleaf()} fails, returns -1
and sets t_errno(3) to @error{TNODATA}.

@subsubheading RETURN VALUE
Upon success, @emph{t_addleaf()} returns zero (0) and confirms the addition of
the requested  leaf.   Upon failure, @emph{t_addleaf()} returns -1 and sets
t_errno(3) to an appropriate error number.

@subsubheading ERRORS
When @emph{t_addleaf()} fails, it returns -1 and sets t_errno(3) to an
appropriate error number as follows:

@table @error
@item TBADF
@var{fd} is invalid.

@item TADDRBUSY
address specificed was already in use by another transport endpoint.

@item TBADADDR
address specified was of an invalid format or contained invalid information.

@item TLOOK
asynchronous  event  occurred  before the call could complete.  See
@ref{t_look}, for more information.

@item TNOADDR
address was not specified and the transport provider could not assign one.

@item TNODATA
attempt was made to read the add leaf confirmation but no add  leaf
confirmation  was available.

@item TNOTSUPPORT
call  requires  the use of a TLI primitive not supported by the underlying
transport provider.

@item TOUTSTATE
call was issued with the interface in an incorrect state.

@item TPROTO
protocol error occurred between the XTI library and the underlying transport
provider.

@item TSYSERR
Linux system error occurred and the Linux error number is set in errno(3).
@end table
