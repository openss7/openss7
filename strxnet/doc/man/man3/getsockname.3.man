.TH GETSOCKNAME 3 "@PACKAGE_DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "@PACKAGE_TITLE@ Library Calls"
.SH NAME
.B getsockname
\- get the socket name
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/socket.h>
.HP
.BI "int getsockname(int " socket ", struct sockaddr *" address ", socklen_t *" address_len );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.BR getsockname ()
function retrieves the locally-bound name of the specified socket, stores this
address in the
.B sockaddr
structure pointed to by the
.I address
argument, and stores the length of this address in the object pointed to by
the
.I address_len
argument.
.PP
If the actual length of the address is greater than the length of
the supplied
.B sockaddr
structure, the stored address will be truncated.
.PP
If the socket has not been bound to a local name, the value stored
in the object pointed to by
.I address
is unspecified.
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
This system call is implemented as a
.B SIOCSOCKSYS
IOCTL.  See
.BR socksys (4)
for more information.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon successful completion, 0 is returned, the
.I address
argument points to the address of the socket, and the
.I address_len
argument points to the length of the address. Otherwise, -1 is returned and
.IR errno (3)
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
The
.BR getsockname ()
function will fail:
.TP
.RB [ EBADF]
The
.I socket
argument is not a valid file descriptor.
.TP
.RB [ EFAULT]
The
.I address
or
.I address_len
parameter can not be accessed or written.
.TP
.RB [ ENOTSOCK]
The
.I socket
argument does not refer to a socket.
.TP
.RB [ EOPNOTSUPP]
The operation is not supported for this socket's protocol.
.PP
The
.BR getsockname ()
function may fail if:
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL]
The socket has been shut down.
.TP
.RB [ ENOBUFS]
Insufficient resources were available in the system to complete
the call.
.TP
.RB [ ENOSR]
There were insufficient
.IR STREAMS (4)
resources available for the
operation to complete.
