\- send transport data with options
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <xti.h>
.HP 8
.BI "int t_sndopt(int " fd ", const struct t_optmgmt *" options ", char *" buf ", unsigned int " nbytes ", int " flags );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I fd
specifies the local transport endpoint upon which to send data.
.TP
.I options
a pointer to a
.B t_optmgmt
structure containing information about the options to send.
.TP
.I buf
is a pointer to a buffer containing the data to send.
.TP
.I nbytes
is the number of bytes in the user supplied buffer.
.TP
.I flags
specify additional information about the data to send.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR t_sndopt ()
sends connection oriented data with options from the local transport endpoint identified by
.IR fd .
.PP
The
.I flags
argument can be a bitwise OR of any of the following flags:
.TP
.B T_MORE
specifies that the next send operation will include data belonging to the same
transport service data unit or expedited transport service data unit.
.TP
.B T_EXPEDITED
specifies that the data is part of an expedited transport service data unit.
When not set, specifies that the data is part of a normal transport service
data unit.
.TP
.B T_PUSH
specifies that any accumulated data should be sent without delay.
.PP
.I options
is a pointer to a
.B t_optmgmt
structure that describes the options to be sent.
The
.B t_optmgmt
structure is formatted as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct t_optmgmt {
        struct netbuf opt;
        t_scalar_t flags;
};
\fR\s+1
.fi
.PP
The
.B t_optmgmt
structure passes the following members and information.
.TP
.I opt
is a
.BR netbuf (3)
structure that contains passed in
options names and values.  Options are structured as described below under
.IR "\(lqOPTIONS\(rq" .
The
.IR options->opt.len
is significant on call.
If
.I options
is
.B NULL
or
.I options->opt.len
is zero on call, no option names and values are passed.
.TP
.I flags
specifies management flags ignored for this call.
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
Options with the
.I opt
field of the
.B t_optmgmt
structure (and other structures including XTI/TLI options)
are a formatted as a contiguous list of options.  Each option in the list
begins with a
.B t_opthdr
structure formatted as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct t_opthdr {
    t_uscalar_t len;            /* Option length, incl. header */
    t_uscalar_t level;          /* Option level */
    t_uscalar_t name;           /* Option name */
    t_uscalar_t status;         /* Negotiation result */
    char value[0];              /* and onwards...  */
};
\fR\s+1
.fi
.PP
The
.B t_opthdr
strucuture contains the following members:
.TP
.I len
the length of the option including the length of this header and the length of
the option value that follows.
.TP
.I level
the level of the option.
.I level
values are transport service provider specific.
.TP
.I name
the name of the option within the
.IR level .
.I name
values are transport service provider specific.
.TP
.I value
the value of the option.  This is a variable lenght field, the length of which
is specific to the option specified by
.I level
and
.IR name.
The format of option values is transport service provider specific.
.PP
Option headers in the options list are always aligned in memory to permit
direct access to the header.  This means that the next option in the
list will begin on the next alignment boundary for a
.B t_opthdr
structure.  A macro is provided to assist the XTI/TLI application writer in
locating the next option in the option list.
.PP
A number of macros are provided to assist with handling options in option
lists.  These macros are decribed as follows:
.HP 12
.B T_OPT_FIRSTHDR(b)
takes a an argument
.I b
a pointer to the
.BR netbuf (3)
structure describing the options list and returns a pointer to the first
.B t_opthdr
structure in the list.
.HP 12
.B T_OPT_NEXTHDR(b, p)
takes as arguments
.I b
a pointer to the
.BR netbuf (3)
structure describing the options list and
.I p
a pointer to the
.B t_opthdr
for the current option, and returns a pointer to the
.B t_opthdr
of the next option in the list, or
.B NULL
if there is no next option in the list.
.HP 12
.B T_OPT_DATA(p)
takes as an argument
.I p
a pointer to the
.B t_opthdr
for the options and returns a unsigned character pointer to the
.I value
for the option.

.SH CAVEATS
.PP
.BR t_sndopt ()
is only valid in the
.BR T_DATAXFER " and " T_INREL
states.
.PP
.BR t_sndopt ()
is only valid for transport service providers of service type
.BR T_COTS " or " T_COTS_ORD .
.PP
In synchronous mode,
.BR t_sndopt ()
blocks until there is sufficent room to buffer the message for transmission
consdering flow control.  In asynchronous mode where there is insufficient
room to buffer the data for transmission considering flow control,
.BR t_sndopt ()
fails, returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to
.RB [ TFLOW ].
.PP
.BR t_sndopt ()
is functionally equivalent to
.BR write (2),
and the two functions can be used interchangeably; however,
.BR write (2)
does not maintain
.IR t_errno (3)
and cannot send options.
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon success,
.BR t_sndopt ()
returns zero (0) or a positive integer reflecting the number of bytes sent.
Upon failure,
.BR t_sndopt ()
returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR t_sndopt ()
fails, it returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number as follows:
.TP \w'[TNOTSUPPORT]\(em'u
.RB [ TBADDATA ]
The amount of data specified for the call and underlying transport service
provider was invalid (i.e. was outside the protocol limits).  See
.BR t_getinfo (3)
and
.BR t_open (3)
for more information.
.TP
.RB [ TBADF ]
.I fd
is invalid.
.TP
.RB [ TBADOPT ]
The options specified were of an invalid format or contained invalid information.
See
.BR t_optmgmt (3)
for more information on option formats.
.TP
.RB [ TBADFLAG ]
The argument
.I flags
contains invalid flags (i.e. flags other than
.BR T_MORE ", " T_EXPEDITED ", " T_PUSH ).
.TP
.RB [ TFLOW ]
The call would block due to flow control and
.I fd
is in asynchronous mode (i.e.
.BR O_NONBLOCK " or " O_NDELAY
was set with
.BR t_open (3)
or
.BR fcntl (2)).
.TP
.RB [ TLOOK ]
An asynchronous event occured before the call could complete.  See
.BR t_look (3)
for more information.
.TP
.RB [ TNOTSUPPORT ]
The call requires the use of a TLI primitive not supported by the underlying transport provider.
This can happen when the transport service provider is of service type
.BR T_CLTS .
.TP
.RB [ TOUTSTATE ]
The call was issued with the interface in a state other than
.BR T_DATAXFER " or " T_INREL .
.TP
.RB [ TPROTO ]
A protocol error occured between the XTI/TLI library and the underlying transport provider.
.TP
.RB [ TSYSERR ]
A
.B Linux
system error occured and the
.B Linux
error number is set in
.IR errno (3).
