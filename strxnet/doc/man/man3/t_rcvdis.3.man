.SH NAME
.B t_rcvdis
\- receive abortive disconnect
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <xti.h>
.HP 8
.BI "int t_rcvdis(int " fd ", struct t_discon *" dis );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I fd
the transport endpoint to disconnect.
.TP
.I dis
a pointer to a
.B t_discon
structure to contain returned disconnect information.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR t_rcvdis ()
receives a disconnect indication arriving on the specified local transport
endpoint
.IR fd .
.PP
.I fd
specifies the local transport endpoint upon which a disconnect indication is
to be received.
.PP
.I dis
a pointer to a
.B t_discon
structure that returns any user disconnect data and the reason and possible
sequence number associated with the disconnect on
.IR fd .
The
.B t_discon
strucuture is formatted as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct t_discon {
        struct netbuf udata;            /* user data */
        int reason;                     /* reason code */
        int sequence;                   /* sequence number */
};
\fR\s+1
.fi
The
.B t_discon
structure returns the following members and contains the following
information:
.TP
.I udata
is a
.BR netbuf (3)
structure that returns any disconnect user data.
The
.I dis->udata.maxlen
is significant on call and the
.I dis->udata.len
is significant on return.
If
.I dis->udata.maxlen
is zero on call, no disconnect data will be returned: any received disconnect data
will be discarded.
If
.I dis->udata.len
is zero on return, no disconnect data was available.
.TP
.I reason
indicates the reason for the disconnection.  The values for the
.I reason
field are transport service provider specific.
.TP
.I sequence
indicates the sequence number, if any, of the connection indication which is
now disconnected.  This field is only significant if the disconnection
indication is subsequent to an outstanding connection indication.  Otherwise,
this field is insignificant and set to zero (0) by the transport service
provider.
.PP
Typically,
.BR t_rcvdis ()
is called after a receive data call fails with
.B TLOOK
and a call to
.BR t_look (3)
returns
.BR T_DISCONNECT .
.\"
.\"
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
.BR t_rcvdis ()
is only valid in states
.BR T_DATAXFER ", " T_OUTCON ", " T_OUTREL ", " T_INREL ", " T_INCON
with outstanding connection indications.
.PP
In synchronous mode,
.BR t_rcvdis ()
blocks until a disconnect indication is received.  In asynchronous mode and a
disconnect indication is not outstanding,
.BR t_rcvdis ()
returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to
.BR TNODIS .
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon success,
.BR t_rcvdis ()
returns zero (0).
Upon failure,
.BR t_rcvdis ()
returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR t_rcvdis ()
fails, it returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number as follows:
.TP \w'[TNOTSUPPORT]\(em'u
.RB [ TBADF ]
.I fd
is invalid.
.TP
.RB [ TBUFOVFLW ]
The
.I dis->udata.maxlen
field of the
.BR netbuf (3)
structure passed to the call was
non-zero, but insufficient to hold the available disconnect user data.  See,
.BR netbuf (3)
for more information.
.TP
.RB [ TNODIS ]
An attempt was made to read a disconnect and no disconnect indication was
available, and the stream is set for asynchronous mode
.BR "" ( O_NONBLOCK " or " O_NDELAY " to " t_open "(3) or " fcntl (2).
.TP
.RB [ TNOTSUPPORT ]
The call requires the use of a TLI primitive not supported by the underlying transport provider.
Abortive disconnect is not supported by all transport service providers.
If the transport provider service type is connectionless
.RB [R T_CLTS , ]
this error is returned.
.TP
.RB [ TOUTSTATE ]
The call was issued with the interface in a state other than
.BR T_DATAXFER ", " T_OUTCON ", " T_OUTREL ", " T_INREL " or " T_INCON
with outstanding connection indications.
.TP
.RB [ TPROTO ]
A protocol error occured between the XTI/TLI library and the underlying transport provider.
.TP
.RB [ TSYSERR ]
A
.B Linux
system error occured and the
.B Linux
error number is set in
.IR errno (3).
