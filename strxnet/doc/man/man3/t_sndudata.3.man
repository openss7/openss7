.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <xti.h>
.HP 8
.BI "int t_sndudata(int " fd ", struct t_unitdata *" data );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I fd
the transport endpoint upon which to send unit data.
.TP
.I data
a pointer to a
.B t_unitdata
structure containing information abou the unit data to send.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR t_sndudata ()
sends connectionless unitdata with options from the local transport endpoint identified by
.I fd
to a specific destination transport address.
.PP
.I fd
specifies the local transport endpoint from which to send the unitdata.
.PP
.I data
is a
.B t_unitdata
structure that describes the destination address, data and options to be sent.
The
.B t_unitdata
structure is formatted as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct t_unitdata {
        struct netbuf addr;             /* address */
        struct netbuf opt;              /* options */
        struct netbuf udata;            /* user data */
};
\fR\s+1
.fi
.PP
The
.B t_unitdata
structure specifies the following members and information:
.TP
.I addr
is a
.BR netbuf (3)
structure specifying the destination address for the unitdata message.
The
.I data->addr.len
is significant on call.
If
.I data->addr.len
is zero on call, no destination address is specified for the unitdata message.
.TP
.I opt
is a
.BR netbuf (3)
structure specifying the options associated with the unitdata message.
.I data->opt.len
is significant on call.
If
.I data->opt.len
is zero on call, no options are associated with the unitdata message.
.TP
.I udata
is a
.BR netbuf (3)
structure specifying the user data to send.
.I data->udata.len
is significant on call.
If
.I data->udata.len
is zero on call, there is no user data associated with the unitdata message.
.\"
.\"
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
.BR t_sndudata ()
is only valid in state
.BR T_IDLE .
.PP
.BR t_sndudata ()
is only valid for transport service providers of service type
.BR T_CLTS .
.PP
In synchronous mode,
.BR t_sndudata ()
blocks until there is sufficient room to buffer the outgoing message
considering flow control.  In
asynchronous mode where the is insufficient room to buffer the outgoing
message considering flow control,
.BR t_sndudata ()
fails, returns -1 and set
.IR t_errno (3)
to
.RB [ TFLOW ].
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon success,
.BR t_sndudata ()
returns zero (0) or a positive integer reflecting the number of bytes sent.
Upon failure,
.BR t_sndudata ()
returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR t_sndudata ()
fails, it returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number as follows:
.TP \w'[TNOTSUPPORT]\(em'u
.RB [ TBADADDR ]
The address specified was of an invalid format or contained invalid information.
.TP
.RB [ TBADDATA ]
The amount of data specified for the call and underlying transport service
provider was invalid (i.e. was outside the protocol limits).  See
.BR t_getinfo (3)
and
.BR t_open (3)
for more information.
.TP
.RB [ TBADF ]
.I fd
is invalid.
.TP
.RB [ TBADOPT ]
The options specified were of an invalid format or contained invalid information.
See
.BR t_optmgmt (3)
for more information on option formats.
.TP
.RB [ TFLOW ]
The call would block due to flow control and
.I fd
is in asynchronous mode
.BR "" ( O_NONBLOCK " or " O_NDELAY
was set using
.BR t_open (3)
or
.BR fcnt (2)).
.TP
.RB [ TLOOK ]
An asynchronous event occured before the call could complete.  See
.BR t_look (3)
for more information.
.TP
.RB [ TNOTSUPPORT ]
The call requires the use of a TLI primitive not supported by the underlying transport provider.
.TP
.RB [ TOUTSTATE ]
The call was issued with the interface in a state other than
.BR T_IDLE .
.TP
.RB [ TPROTO ]
A protocol error occured between the XTI library and the underlying transport provider.
.TP
.RB [ TSYSERR ]
A
.B Linux
system error occured and the
.B Linux
error number is set in
.IR errno (3).
