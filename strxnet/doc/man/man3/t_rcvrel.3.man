.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <xti.h>
.HP 8
.BI "int t_rcvrel(int " fd );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I fd
the transport endpoint for which to receive an orderly release.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR t_rcvrel ()
receives an orderly release indication arriving on the specified local
transport endpoint
.IR fd .
.PP
.I fd
specifies the local transport endpoint upon which an orderly release
indication is to be received.
.PP
No additional information is availble about the orderly release indication
with
.BR t_rcvrel ().
See
.BR t_rcvreldata (3)
for another mechanism.
.\"
.\"
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
.BR t_rcvrel ()
is only valid in states
.BR T_DATAXFER " and " T_OUTREL .
.PP
.BR t_rcvrel ()
is only valid for transport service providers of service type
.BR T_COTS_ORD .
.PP
In synchronous mode,
.BR t_rcvrel ()
blocks until an orderly release indication is received or an asynchronous
event occurs.
In asynchronous mode, if no orderly release indication is immediately
avaialble,
.BR t_rcvrel ()
fails, returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to
.BR TNOREL .
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon success,
.BR t_rcvrel ()
returns zero (0).
Upon failure,
.BR t_rcvrel ()
returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR t_rcvrel ()
fails, it returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number as follows:
.TP \w'[TNOTSUPPORT]\(em'u
.RB [ TBADF ]
.I fd
is invalid.
.TP
.RB [ TLOOK ]
An asynchronous event occured before the call could complete.  See
.BR t_look (3)
for more information.
.TP
.RB [ TNOREL ]
An attempt was made to read an orderly release and no orderly release indication was available.
.TP
.RB [ TNOTSUPPORT ]
The call requires the use of a TLI primitive not supported by the underlying transport provider.
.TP
.RB [ TOUTSTATE ]
The call was issued with the interface in an incorrect state.
.TP
.RB [ TPROTO ]
A protocol error occured between the XTI/TLI library and the underlying transport provider.
.TP
.RB [ TSYSERR ]
A
.B Linux
system error occured and the
.B Linux
error number is set in
.IR errno (3).
