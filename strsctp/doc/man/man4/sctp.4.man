.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B SCTP
is an implementation of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol
.RB ( SCTP )
define in RFC 2960
.[
RFC 2960
.]
and RFC 3309.
.[
RFC 3309
.]
.B SCTP
provides reliable deliver of ordered or unordered packets over a full duplex
connection between two streams on top of
.BR ip (4).
.B SCTP
can guarantee that the data arrives in order on a stream, if requested, and
retransmits lost packets.  It generates and checks a per-packet checksum to
catch transmission errors.
.B SCTP
uses the services of the Internet Protocol,
.BR ip (4),
to transfer packets.
.PP
.B SCTP
is implemented as a
.IR STREAMS (4)
multiplexing driver.
.BR ip (4)
streams are lined under the
.BR SCTP
multiplexing driver using the
.IR I_LINK " or " I_PLINK
commands of
.BR streamio (7),
to provide network services to
.BR SCTP .
Once linked, the streams must be configured using
.BR sctp_ioctl (4).
.PP
.B SCTP
provides two stream types.  To select one of the stream types,
.I sctp_device
can be one of the following:
.TP
.I /dev/sctp_n
This device provides the
.B SCTP
protocol services using the N-primitives of the
Network Provider Interface,
.BR npi (7),
used for the Stream Control Transmission Protocol as described in
.BR npi_sctp (7).
The
.BR npi (7)
interface provided on a stream opening this device is suitable for use with
the
.BR sockets (3)
library and provides the
.B SCTP
interface using sockets as described in
.BR sctp (7).
This stream provides connection-oriented NPI services.
.TP
.I /dev/sctp_t
This device provides the
.B SCTP
protocol service interface using the T-primitives of the Transport Provider
Interface,
.BR tpi (7),
used of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol, as described in
.BR tpi_sctp (7).
The
.BR tpi (7)
interface provided on a stream opening this device is suitable for use with
the
.BR xnet "(3) or " xti (3)
library and provides the
.B SCTP
interface using XTI as described in
.BR xti_sctp (3).
.PP
.B SCTP
provides three socket types for use by the
.BR sockets (3)
library
.BR socket (7)
calls.
.B SCTP
provides sockets in the protocol family
.B PF_INET
using the protocol number
.BR IPPROTO_SCTP .
The
.I socket_type
argument can be one of the following:
.TP
.B SOCK_SEQPACKET
A standard
.I SOCK_SEQPACKET
socket that preserves message boundaries, Nagles at the association level, and
provides ordered and unordered reliable and partial reliable, acknnowledged
and unacknowledged delivery on multiple streams.
This socket uses the underlying
.I /dev/sctp_t
transport service provider.
.TP
.B SOCK_STREAM
A
.BR tcp (7)
compatible
.I SOCK_STREAM
socket that does not preserve message boundaries, Nagles at the stream level,
and provides ordered and out-of-band unacknowledged deliver on a single
stream.  This is an optional capability of
.BR SCTP
that provides for maximum compatability with applications written for
.BR tcp (4).
This socket uses the underlying
.I /dev/sctp_t
transport service provider.
.TP
.B SOCK_RDM
A
.BR udp (7)
compatible
.I SOCK_RDM
socket that preserves message boundaries, does not Nagle, and provides only
unordered but reliable or partially reliable delivery on multiple streams.
This is an optional capability of
.B SCTP
that provides for maximum compatibility with applications written for
.BR rudp (7).
This socket uses the underlying
.I /dev/sctp_t
transport service provider.
.PP
The following entries in /etc/protosw provides the information necessary for
.BR socksys (4)
to use these devices:

.SH IOCTLS
.PP
.PP
All interfaces support a set of management IO controls using
.BR ioctl (2)
and
.BR streamio (7)
.I I_STR
system calls on the
.IR sctp_stream ", " sctp_xtistr " or " sctp_socket .
These management controls are described in
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.PP
.B SCTP
has several implementations.  This manpage is for the
.IR STREAMS (4)
implementation.  There is also an
.BR INET (4)
implementation which provides
.BR tpi (7)
access to the Linux NET4 version of
.BR SCTP .
For more information on this version, see
.BR sctp (7).
