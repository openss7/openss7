.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B soconfig
utility configures the transport provider driver for use with sockets.  It
specifies how the
.IR family ,
.IR type ,
and
.I protocol
parameters in the
.BR socket (3)
call are mapped to the name of a transport provider such as
.BR /dev/tcp .
This utility can be used to add an additional mapping or remove a previous
mapping.
.PP
The
.BR init (8)
utility uses
.B soconfig
with the
.BR sock2path (5)
file during the booting sequence.
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The following command options are supported:
.TP
[\fB-l\fR, \fB--list\fR]
List the contents of the current kernel mapping in the format of a
.BR sock2path (5)
formatted configuration file.
This is also the default if no command option or arguments are specified.
This command option cannot be combined with any other command option.
.TP
[\fB-c\fR, \fB--clear\fR] \fIfamily\fP \fItype\fP \fIprotocol\fP
Clear the specified
.IR family ", " type ", " protocol
3-tuple.
This is also the default if three arguments are specified with no command option.
This command option cannot be combined with any other command option.
.TP
[\fB-s\fR, \fB--set\fR] \fIfamily\fP \fItype\fP \fIprotocol\fP \fIpath\fP
Set the specified
.IR family ", " type ", " protocol
3-tuple to the specified
.IR path .
This is also the default if four arguments are specified with no command option.
This command option cannot be combined with any other command option.
.TP
\fB-r\fR, \fB--reset\fR
Reset (clear) the kernel mapping.
This command option cannot be combined with any other command option.
.TP
\fB-f\fR, \fB--file\fR[=]\fIFILE\fR
Set up the
.B soconfig
configuration for each driver according to the information stored in
.IR FILE .
An
.B soconfig
file consists of lines formatted as described under
.RI \*(lq "FILE FORMAT" \*(rq,
below.
This command option cannot be combined with any other command option.
.PP
The following general options are supported:
.TP
\fB-q\fR, \fB--quiet\fR
Specifies that the caller is interested only in the return code and error diagnostics and that
normal output should be suppressed.
The default verbosity level if this option is not specified is
.BR 1 .
This option is equivalent to
.BR --verbose=0 .
.TP
\fB-v\fR, \fB--verbose\fR[=][\fILEVEL\fR]
Increases or sets the verbosity level.  When this option is given without the
.I LEVEL
argument, it specifies that the verbosity level should be increased by one.  If the
.I LEVEL
argument is specified, the verbosity level is set to that integer value.  This option can be
repeated.
The default verbosity level if this option is not specified is
.BR 1 .
For example,
.B -vvvv
is equivalent to
.BR --verbose=5 .
.TP
\fB-h\fR, \fB--help\fR
When this option is encountered,
print usage information to
.I stdout
and exit.
Note that all options specified following this option are ignored.
.TP
\fB-V\fR, \fB--version\fR
When this option is encountered,
print version information to
.I stdout
and exit.
Note that all options specified following this option are ignored.
.TP
\fB-C\fR, \fB--copying\fR
When this option is encountered,
print copying information to
.I stdout
and exit.
Note that all options specified following this option are ignored.

.TP
.I path

.SH FILE FORMAT
.PP

.BR sock2path (5).
.\"
.\"
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
When
.B soconfig
fails, it prints a diagnostic message to
.I stderr
and exits with a non-zero return code.  The following return codes are
generated under the following conditions:
.TP
0
Execution was successful.  All arguments or all lines of the specified
.I FILE
were processed successfully.
.TP
1
Execution was unsuccessful.  Arguments were valid, however, processing of the
specified path or processing of one of the paths contained in the specified
.I FILE
failed.
A diagnostic message is normally printed on
.IR stderr .
This could result in the partial population of the kernel socket
mapping if some lines were processed successfully and one failed.
.TP
2
An invalid parameter was provided or the number or combination of arguments
and options was invalid.
A diagnostic message is normally printed on
.IR stderr .

.\"
.SH NOTICES

.B soconfig
is normaly invoked from the

.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.B soconfig
is compatible with
.IR Solaris \(rg
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
Many
.IR UNIX \(rg
implementations moved away from using the
.BR /etc/netconfig
approach and the
.BR sockmod (4)
.IR STREAMS (9)
module for providing mapping from the
.BR socket (3)
call to the appropriate underlying transport provider
.IR STREAMS (9)
device.  Mapping is now maintained in the kernel using the
.B SIOCPROTO
and
.B SIOCXPROTO
input-output controls.  It was, therefore, necessary to provide some utility to initialize the
kernel mapping entries:
.IR UnixWare \(rg
provided the
.BR initsock (8)
command, whereas,
.IR Solaris \(rg
provided the
.BR soconfig (8)
command.  For compatibility,
.B "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
provides both.
.IP \(em
.IR Solaris \(rg
does not document long options.
.IP \(em
.IR Solaris \(rg
does not document the
.BR -l ", " -s ", " -r ", " -q ", " -v ", " -h ", " -V " or " -C
options.
.IP \(em
Options
.BR --help " and " --version
are provided for compatibility with GNU coding standards;
.BR --copying ,
OpenSS7 coding standards.
.IP \(em
The format of the output from the
.B soconfig
command may be different from that of
.IR Solaris \(rg.
.IP \(em
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
uses the same format of arguments and file as described here with one
extension: it is possible to use symbolic names (e.g.
.BR AF_INET )
for the
.IR family ", " type " and " protocol
fields.  However, not all symbolic names are populated in the
.B soconfig
command.
.IP \(em
.IR Solaris \(rg
does not support symbolic names (e.g.
.BR AF_INET )
for the fields and expects decimal number representations only.
.IP \(em
The mechanism that actually uses the kernel-populated socket mapping is
different under
.IR Solaris \(rg
and
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" .
.IP \(em
At boot time, the kernel mapping is populated using the
.B soconfig
command and the
.B /etc/sock2path
file.  This is performed with the
.B @PACKAGE@
or
.B @PACKAGE@.sh
init script and not directly by the
.BR init (8)
process.
.IP \(em
The
.B soconfig
utility is only compatible with
.IR Solaris \(rg
for the purposes of populating the kernel mapping for use by
.B libsocket.so
in the
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
package.  Any other use of the
.B soconfig
command is unsupported.

.BR @PACKAGE_UCNAME@ (8)
