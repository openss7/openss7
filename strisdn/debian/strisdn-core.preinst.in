## Again, unfortunately, recent non-autoconf/dpkg releases of LiS have chosen to install their
## modconf files in a similar fashion to ours and in a similar location.  It even uses the prune
## modules line that we normally use, however, on Debian their modules.conf edits will be lost
## because the modules.conf file is generated from the modules/conf.d directory.
