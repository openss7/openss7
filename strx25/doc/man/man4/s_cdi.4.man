.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
and most OpenSS7 packages, utilize the Communications Device Interface (CDI),
.[
cdi revision 0.9.2
.]
.BR cdi (7),
as an interface to WAN devices.  However, due to the widespread use in the
1990's of systems deploying SpiderWAN, SpiderX.25
.[
spiderx25wan
.]
and SpiderISDN
.[
spiderisdnwan
.]
a number of applications programs, as well as \fISTREAMS\fP(9) drivers and
modules may have been written to provide these interfaces.  Therefore, to
provide compatibility between the OpenSS7 CDI implementations of applications
and user modules or drivers expecting a CDI interface, the \fBS_CDI\fP module
was developed to provide source compatibility with these modules or drivers.
.PP
The \fBS_CDI\fP module is a pushable \fISTREAMS\fP(9) module that performs
conversion between the Spider
.IR "Wide Area Network (WAN)" ,
.[
spiderx25wan
.]
interface at the lower service interface, and the
.IR "Communications Device Interface (CDI)" ,
.[
cdi revision 0.9.2
.]
.BR cdi (7),
at the upper service interface.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.B S_CDI
is not normally pushed by user applications.  Rather, it is pushed as necessary
by OpenSS7 stack configuration programs or as part of an extended interface for
a WAN device driver using an
.BR autopush (8)
specification in configuration files, or an
.BR autopush (9)
specification within the device driver itself.
.\"
.\"
.SH PRIMITIVES
.PP
.B S_CDI
accepts and issues Communications Device Interface (CDI),
.[
cdi revision 0.9.2
.]
.BR cdi (7),
service primitives at its upper service interface boundary.
.B S_CDI
accepts and issues Wide Area Network (WAN) Interface,
.[
wan revision 0.9.2
.]
.BR wan (7),
services primitives at its lower service interface boundary.
.\"
.\"
.SH IOCTLS
.PP
While the underlying driver should support the WAN input-output controls
described under
.BR wan (7),
the
.B S_CDI
module also supports CDI input-output controls described for the OpenSS7
Project drivers under
.BR cdi (7).
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
The Spider Wide Area Network (WAN) interface is a proprietary interface without
a \fIformal\fP standard (although its widespread use makes it an \fIipso
facto\fP standard).  Either the Communications Device Interface (CDI),
.[
cdi revision 0.9.2
.]
.BR cdi (7),
or the Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI),
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR dlpi (7),
should be used in its stead.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.B S_CDI
is compatible with the Spider WAN interface,
.[
wan revision 0.9.2
.]
and implementations based on 
.IR SpiderWAN ,
such as
.IR "AIXlink/X.25" ,
.IR "HP-UX X.25" ,
.IR "IRIS SX.25" ,
.IR "Solstice X.25" ,
.IR "PT X.25" , 
.IR "SBE X.25" , 
.IR "RadiSys WAN" ,
and others,
with the following compatibility considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
Although the
.BR wan (7)
interface is an \fiipso facto\fP standard, it should not be used by portable
programs.  The Open Group Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI),
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR dlpi (7),
should be used in its stead.
.IP \(em
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
attempts to maintain
.I source compatibility
with the core features provided by most implementations, but compatibility with
all features of all implementations is not possible.  Your mileage may vary.
.RS
.PP
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
provides a core
.I source compatible
implementation of the Spider WAN interface as described in OpenSS7 project
documentation,
.[
wan revision 0.9.2
.]
for the purpose of porting legacy WAN applications, drivers and modules to
.B Linux
with a minimal porting effort.  While
.I source compatibility
with core features is attempted,
.I binary compatibility
is not attempted.  Any binary compatibility experienced could be broken in a
subsequent release.
.PP
New applications should use the Communications Device Interface (CDI),
.[
cdi revision 0.9.2
.]
.BR cdi (7),
instead.
