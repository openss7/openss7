.SH INTERFACE

Network Layer Interface (NLI),

.BR nli (7).
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.nf
\f(CW\s-1\

struct xrscf {
    unsigned char xl_type;
    unsigned char xl_command;

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The Reset Response or Confirmation message primitive, \fBN_RC\fP, is used
by the NS user to respond to a Reset Indication for the connection, or by the NS
provider to confirm a Reset Request.
The control part of the message consists of one
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block, and
contains the \fBxrscf\fP structure.
There is no data part
.RI ( M_DATA (9)
message blocks) associated with this message primitive.
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
.PP
The Reset Response and Reset Confirmation use the \fBxrscf\fP structure.
The control part of the message consists of one
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block
containing the \fBxrscf\fP structure.
There is no data part
.RB ( M_DATA (9)
message blocks) associated with this message primitive.
.\"
.\"
.SH MEMBERS
.PP
The \fBxrscf\fP structure contains the following members:
.TP
.I xl_type
Always \fBXL_CTL\fP.
.TP
.I xl_command
Always \fBXL_RC\fP, for both Reset Response and Reset Confirmation.
.\"
.\"
.SH STATE
.PP
This message primitive is valid in the data transfer phase.
.\"
.\"
.SH RESPONSE
.PP
The Reset Response message primitive is used by the NS user to respond to and
acknowledge a previous Reset Indication message primitive from the NS provider.
The Reset Confirmation message primitive is used by the NS provider to respond
to and acknowledge a previous Reset Request message primitive from the NS user.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The Reset Response message primitive is equivalent to the
.BR N_RESET_RES (7)
of the Network Provider Interface (NPI),
.[
npi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR npi (7);
the Reset Confirmation,
.BR N_RESET_CON (7).

.SH NOTICES
.PP
The Network Layer Interface (NLI) is a proprietary interface without a formal
standard.  Either the Network Provider Interface (NPI),
.[
npi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR npi (7),
or the XTI-X25 interface,
.[
xx25
.]
.BR xti_x25 (3),
should be used in its stead.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.B N_RC
is compatible with NLI, and implementations based on NLI such as
.IR "Solaris Solstice" \(rg " X.25 9.2" ,
.[
solx25pg
.]
.IR "IRIX SX.25" ,
.[
sx25
.]
.IR "HP-UX X.25/9000" ,
.IR "PT X.25" ,
.[
ptx25
.]
with the following considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.IR "Solaris Solstice" \(rg " X.25 9.2" ,
.[
solx25pg
.]
.IR "IRIX SX.25" ,
.[
sx25
.]
.IR "PT X.25" ,
.[
ptx25
.]
are consistent in their documentation of
.BR N_RC .
.IP \(em
NLI is an inherently low level and non-portable interface and should not be
used by portable programs.  Portable programs should use the NPI or XX25
interfaces in its stead.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not attempted: only a rough source compatibility.  Any
binary compatibility exhibited is a bug and is scheduled to be removed in the
next release.
.PP
See
.BR NLI (7),
.IR STREAMS (4),
for additional compatiblity considerations.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
The NLI is not a formal standard.  The
.IR OpenSS7 \(tm
implementation of NLI conforms to documentation for Version 3 of the NLI.
.\"
.\"
.SH HISTORY
.PP
The NLI is an interface originally developed by Spider Systems, Ltd. (now a
division of Emmerson Power).  The NLI interface found its way into may
mainstream UNIX implementations and UNIX-like RTOS sporting STREAMS such as
Windriver's VxWorks.  The NLI was never standardized and remains an inherently
non-portable interface.
