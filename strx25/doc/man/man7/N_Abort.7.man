.SH INTERFACE

Network Layer Interface (NLI),

.BR nli (7).
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.nf
\f(CW\s-1\
.B #include <netx25/x25_proto.h>

struct xabortf {
    unsigned char xl_type;
    unsigned char xl_command;

.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The Abort Indication message primtiive is used by the X.25 driver in lieue of a
Disconnect Indication, when there is insufficient resources to generate a
Disconnect Indication.  Therefore, some NS providers may never issue this
message primitive.
Nevertheless, the NS user must be prepared to receive this message primitive in
liueue of a Disconnect Indication.
The control part of the message consists of one
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block
containing the
.B xabortf
structure.
There is no data part
.RB ( M_DATA (9)
message blocks) associated with this message primitive.
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
.PP
The Abort Indication uses the
.B xabortf
structure.
The control part of the message consists of one
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block
containing the
.B xabortf
structure.
There is no data part
.RB ( M_DATA (9)
message blocks) associated with this message primitive.
.\"
.\"
.SH MEMBERS
.PP
The
.B xabortf
structure contains the following members:
.TP
.I xl_type
Always \fBXL_CTL\fP.
.TP
.I xl_command
Always \fBN_Abort\fP, for Abort Indication. 
.\"
.\"
.SH STATE
.PP
This message primitive is only valid in the data transfer phase.  The call moves
to the disconnected phase.
.\"
.\"
.SH RESPONSE
.PP
This message primitive is only issued by the NS provider.
No response is expected when the NS provider issues this primitive.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The Abort Indication message primitive is equivalent to the
.BR N_DISCON_IND (7)
of the Network Provider Interface (NPI),
.[
npi revision 2.0.0

.BR npi (7).

.SH NOTICES
.PP
The Network Layer Interface (NLI) is a proprietary interface without a formal
standard.  Either the Network Provider Interface (NPI),
.[
npi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR npi (7),
or the XTI-X25 interface,
.[
xx25
.]
.BR xti_x25 (3),
should be used in its stead.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.B N_Abort
is compatible with NLI, and implementations based on NLI such as
.IR "Solaris Solstice" \(rg " X.25 9.2" ,
.[
solx25pg
.]
.IR "IRIX SX.25" ,
.[
sx25
.]
.IR "HP-UX X.25/9000" ,
.IR "PT X.25" ,
.[
ptx25
.]
with the following considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.IR "Solaris Solstice" \(rg " X.25 9.2" ,
.[
solx25pg
.]
.IR "IRIX SX.25" ,
.[
sx25
.]
.IR "PT X.25" ,
.[
ptx25
.]
are consistent in their documentation of
.BR N_Abort .
.IP \(em
NLI is an inherently low level and non-portable interface and should not be
used by portable programs.  Portable programs should use the NPI or XX25
interfaces in its stead.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not attempted: only a rough source compatibility.  Any
binary compatibility exhibited is a bug and is scheduled to be removed in the
next release.
.PP
See
.BR NLI (7),
.IR STREAMS (4),
for additional compatiblity considerations.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
The NLI is not a formal standard.  The
.IR OpenSS7 \(tm
implementation of NLI conforms to documentation for Version 3 of the NLI.
.\"
.\"
.SH HISTORY
.PP
The NLI is an interface originally developed by Spider Systems, Ltd. (now a
division of Emmerson Power).  The NLI interface found its way into may
mainstream UNIX implementations and UNIX-like RTOS sporting STREAMS such as
Windriver's VxWorks.  The NLI was never standardized and remains an inherently
non-portable interface.
