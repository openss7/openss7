.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The Extended Listen Request or Response is used when an NS user wishes to
register interest in incoming calls and the NS provider acknowledges the
request.  The control part of the message consists of one
.BR M_PROTO (9)
or
.BR M_PCPROTO (9)
message block, and contains the
.B xlistenf
structure.
The data part of the message consists of one or more
.BR M_DATA (9)
message blocks
containing the call user data and address of interest.
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
.PP
The Extended Listen Request and Extended Listen Response use the
.B xlistenf
structure.
The control part of the message consists of one
.BR M_PROTO (9)
or
.BR M_PCPROTO (9)
message block, and contains the
.B xlistenf
structure.
The data part of the message consists of one or more
.BR M_DATA (9)
message blocks
containing the call user data and address of interest.
.\"
.\"
.SH MEMBERS
.PP
The
.B xlistenf
structure contains the following members:
.TP
.I xl_type
Always \fBXL_CTL\fP.
.TP
.I xl_command
Always \fBN_Xelisten\fP, for both Extended Listen Request and Extended Listen Response.
.TP
.I lmax
Conveys the maximum number of outstanding Connect Indications that the listening
Stream is willing to accept, for the addresses conveyed in the attached
.BR M_DATA (9)
message blocks.
.PP
Listen requests are cummulated but this field is not.  The maximum number of
outstanding Connect Indications will be reflected by the value of this field for
the last successful Listen Request issued by the NS user.
.TP
.I l_result
Conveys the result of the Listen Request in a Listen Response message primitive.
An error in the parameters or a lack of resources results in this flag being set
to a non-zero value.
.PP
The
.BR M_DATA (9)
portion of the message contains the following members:
.TP
.I l_cumode
Specifies the type of matching.
This field can have one of the following values:
.RS
.PP
.TS
tab(:);
lnls

.TP
.I l_length
Specifies the length of the \fIl_add\fP field in semi-octets.  That is, the
length of the \fIl_add\fP field in octets is: \*(lq\fB((l_length+1)>>1)\fP\*(rq.  The
maximum length for a DTE address is 15 or 17 semi-octets (that is, 8 or 9
octets) depending upon whether TOA/NPI addressing is used.  The maximum length
for an NSAP address is 20 semi-octets (that is, 10 octets).
.TP
.I l_add
Contains the bytes to be matched against the DTE address or the NSAP address.

.SH STATE
.PP
This message primitive is valid in the disconnected phase or during an incoming
connecting phase.
.\"
.\"
.SH RESPONSE
.PP
When an NS user issues a Listen Request, the NS user expects an Extended Listen
Response message primitive from the NS provider.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The Extended Listen Request message primitive is equivalent to the
.BR N_BIND_REQ (7)
of the Network Provider Interface (NPI),
.[
npi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR npi (7);
the Extended Listen Response,
.BR N_BIND_ACK (7).

.SH NOTICES
.PP
The Network Layer Interface (NLI) is a proprietary interface without a formal
standard.  Either the Network Provider Interface (NPI),
.[
npi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR npi (7),
or the XTI-X25 interface,
.[
xx25
.]
.BR xti_x25 (3),
should be used in its stead.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.B N_Xelisten
is compatible with NLI, and implementations based on NLI such as
.IR "Solaris Solstice" \(rg " X.25 9.2" ,
.[
solx25pg
.]
.IR "IRIX SX.25" ,
.[
sx25
.]
.IR "HP-UX X.25/9000" ,
.IR "PT X.25" ,

with the following considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.IR "Solaris Solstice" \(rg " X.25 9.2" ,
.[
solx25pg
.]
.IR "IRIX SX.25" ,
.[
sx25
.]
.IR "PT X.25" ,
.[
ptx25
.]
are consistent in their documentation of
.BR N_Xelisten .
.IP \(em
NLI is an inherently low level and non-portable interface and should not be
used by portable programs.  Portable programs should use the NPI or XX25
interfaces in its stead.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not attempted: only a rough source compatibility.  Any
binary compatibility exhibited is a bug and is scheduled to be removed in the
next release.
.PP
See
.BR NLI (7),
.IR STREAMS (4),
for additional compatiblity considerations.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
The NLI is not a formal standard.  The
.IR OpenSS7 \(tm
implementation of NLI conforms to documentation for Version 3 of the NLI.
.\"
.\"
.SH HISTORY
.PP
The NLI is an interface originally developed by Spider Systems, Ltd. (now a
division of Emmerson Power).  The NLI interface found its way into may
mainstream UNIX implementations and UNIX-like RTOS sporting STREAMS such as
Windriver's VxWorks.  The NLI was never standardized and remains an inherently
non-portable interface.
