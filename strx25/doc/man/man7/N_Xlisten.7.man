.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The Listen Request or Response is used when an NS user wishes to register
interest in incoming calls and the NS provider acknowledges the request.
The control part of the message consists of one
.BR M_PROTO (9)
or
.BR M_PCPROTO (9)
message block, and contains the
.B xlistenf
structure.
The data part of the message consists of one or more
.BR M_DATA (9)
message blocks
containing the call user data and address of interest.
.PP
The Listen Request queue is ordered in terms of the amount of listen data
supplied.  The more a Listen Request asks for, the higher its place in the
queue.  Connect Indications are sent to the listener whose listening criteria
are best matched.
.PP
Privileged users can ask for a Listen Request to be placed at the front of the
queue, regardless of the amount of listen data supplied.  To do this, the Listen
Request should be sent as a
.BR M_PCPROTO (9)
message.  This is achieved by
setting the
.B RS_HIPRI
flag in
.BR putmsg (2s).
Such requests are
searched in the order in which they arrive.
.PP
The system adminstrator controls whether or not listening for incoming  calls is
a privileged operation.  If listening is privileged, incoming calls will be sent
only to on listen streams opened by a user with superuser privilege.  This
prevents other users accepting calls that may contain private information,
passwords, and so on.
.PP
In systems where privileged and non-privileged listens are allowed:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
Privileged listens have priority.
.IP \(bu
A matching but busy privileged listen prevents a search of any
non-privileged listens.
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
.PP
The Listen Request and Listen Response use the
.B xlistenf
structure.
The control part of the message consists of one
.BR M_PROTO (9)
or
.BR M_PCPROTO (9)
message block, and contains the
.B xlistenf
structure.
The data part of the message consists of one or more
.BR M_DATA (9)
message blocks
containing the call user data and address of interest.

.SH MEMBERS
.PP
The
.B xlistenf
structure contains the following members:
.TP
.I xl_type
Always \fBXL_CTL\fP.
.TP
.I xl_command
Always \fBN_Xlisten\fP, for both Listen Request and Listen Response.
.TP
.I lmax
Conveys the maximum number of outstanding Connect Indications that the listening
Stream is willing to accept, for the addresses conveyed in the attached
.BR M_DATA (9)
message blocks.
.RS
.PP
Listen requests are cummulated but this field is not.  The maximum number of
outstanding Connect Indications will be reflected by the value of this field for
the last successful Listen Request issued by the NS user.
.RE
.TP
.I l_result
Conveys the result of the Listen Request in a Listen Response message primitive.
An error in the parameters or a lack of resources results in this flag being set
to a non-zero value.
.PP
The
.BR M_DATA (9)
portion of the message contains the following members:
.TP
.I l_cumode
Specifies the type of matching.
This field can have one of the following values:
.RS
.PP
.TS
tab(:);
lnls
lbnls.
Constant:Value:Description
_
X25_DONTCARE:1:Represents a wildcard.
X25_STARTSWITTH:2:Contains a prefix.
X25_IDENTITY:3:Contains an identity match.
.\"X25_PATTERN:4:Contains a pattern. (Note that \fBX25_PATTERN\fP is Solstice X.25 specific.)
.\"X25_MATCH:4:Contains a pattern match. (Note that \fBX25_MATCH\fP appears to be PT WAN specific.)
.\"X25_SNID:5:Contains a Subnetwork ID (SNID).

.B Notes:
.IP 1. \w'0.\(em'u
When the \fIl_cumode\fP is set to \fBX25_DONTCARE\fP, the
\fIl_culength\fP and \fIl_cubytes\fP fields are ommitted from the
.BR M_DATA (9)
message block.
.RE
.TP
.I l_culength
Contains the bytes to be matched against the Call User Data (CUD).
.TP
.I l_cubytes

.B Notes:
.IP 1. \w'1.\(em'u
When the \fIl_mode\fP is set to \fBX25_DONTCARE\fP, the
\fIl_type\fP, \fIl_length\fP and \fIl_add\fP fields are ommitted from
the
.BR M_DATA (9)
message block.
.IP 2.
When the \fIl_mode\fP is set to \fBX25_PATTERN\fP, the
\fIl_add\fP field can contain the wilcard digits \*(lq\fB*\fP\*(rq and \*(lq\fB?\fP\*(rq that
have the same effect as these characters in regular expressions: that is,
\*(lq\fB*\fP\*(rq represents zero or more characters of any value, and \*(lq\fB?\fP\*(rq
represents single character of any value.  The \*(lq\fB*\fP\*(rq character is represented
by the BCD digit \fB0xF\fP and the \*(lq\fB?\fP\*(rq character is represented by the BCD
digit \fB0xE\fP.
.IP 3.
\fBX25_PATTERN\fP is Solstice X.25 specific.
.RE
.TP
.I l_type
This field can have one of the following values:
.RS
.PP
.TS
tab(:);
lnls
lbnls.
Constant:Value:Description
_
X25_DTE:1:Contains an X.25 DTE (X.121) address.
X25_NSAP:2:Contains a CONS NSAP address.
_
.TE
.RE
.TP
.I l_length
Specifies the length of the \fIl_add\fP field in semi-octets.  That is, the
length of the \fIl_add\fP field in octets is: \*(lq\fB((l_length+1)>>1)\fP\*(rq.  The
maximum length for a DTE address is 15 or 17 semi-octets (that is, 8 or 9
octets) depending upon whether TOA/NPI addressing is used.  The maximum length
for an NSAP address is 20 semi-octets (that is, 10 octets).
.TP
.I l_add
Contains the bytes to be matched against the DTE address or the NSAP address.
.RS
.PP
Each semi-octet is a BCD representation.  That is, digits in the range \*(lq\fB0\fP\*(rq through
\*(lq\fB9\fP\*(rq are represented by \fB0x0\fP through \fB0x9\fP in the semi-octet
position.  The first digit occupies the high order nibble of the first octet;
the second digit, the low order nibble of the first octet; the third digit, the
high order nibble of the second octet; and so on.  If @member{l_length} is odd,
the low order nibble of the last octet is ignored.
.PP
When the @member{l_mode} field is @pval{X25_PATTERN}, a semi-octet of
\fB0xF\fP represents a \*(lq\fB*\fP\*(rq wildcard, and a semi-octet of \fB0xE\fP
represents a \*(lq\fB?\fP\*(rq wildcard.

.SH STATE
.PP
This message primitive is valid in the disconnected phase or during an incoming
connecting phase.

.SH RESPONSE
.PP
When an NS user issues a Listen Request, the NS user expects a Listen Response
message primitive from the NS provider.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The Listen Request message primitive is equivalent to the
.BR N_BIND_REQ (7)
of the Network Provider Interface (NPI),
.[
npi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR npi (7);
the Listen Response,
.BR N_BIND_ACK (7).

.SH NOTICES
.PP
The Network Layer Interface (NLI) is a proprietary interface without a formal
standard.  Either the Network Provider Interface (NPI),
.[
npi revision 2.0.0
.]
.BR npi (7),
or the XTI-X25 interface,
.[
xx25
.]
.BR xti_x25 (3),
should be used in its stead.

is compatible with NLI, and implementations based on NLI such as
.IR "Solaris Solstice" \(rg " X.25 9.2" ,

.]
.IR "IRIX SX.25" ,
.[

.IR "Solaris Solstice" \(rg " X.25 9.2" ,

solx25pg
.]
.IR "IRIX SX.25" ,
.[
sx25
.]
.IR "PT X.25" ,
.[
ptx25
.]
are consistent in their documentation of
.BR N_Xlisten .
.IP \(em
NLI is an inherently low level and non-portable interface and should not be
used by portable programs.  Portable programs should use the NPI or XX25
interfaces in its stead.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not attempted: only a rough source compatibility.  Any
binary compatibility exhibited is a bug and is scheduled to be removed in the
next release.
.PP
See
.BR NLI (7),
.IR STREAMS (4),
for additional compatiblity considerations.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
The NLI is not a formal standard.  The
.IR OpenSS7 \(tm
implementation of NLI conforms to documentation for Version 3 of the NLI.
.\"
.\"
.SH HISTORY
.PP
The NLI is an interface originally developed by Spider Systems, Ltd. (now a
division of Emmerson Power).  The NLI interface found its way into may
mainstream UNIX implementations and UNIX-like RTOS sporting STREAMS such as
Windriver's VxWorks.  The NLI was never standardized and remains an inherently
non-portable interface.
