    DESCRIPTION
	"Specifies or indicates the current subscription of 
	 faciltiies that may only be negotiated when no virtual 
	 calls are in progress on the interface, with the 
	 On-line Facility Registration facility, using the 
	 FacilityWhileIdle textual convention.
	
	 For a DTE subscribed to ths On-line Facility 
	 Registration facility, this set value represents the 
	 subscription of facilities reported by the DCE or DXE 
	 in a registration confirmation packet, and is writable 
	 by a management station when the administrative state 
	 is 'locked' and subject to negotiation with the DCE.
	
	 For a DTE not subscribed to the On-line Facility 
	 Registration facility, this set value represents the 
	 subscription of facilities, agreed to for a time 
	 between the DTE and DCE, and is writable by a 
	 management station when the administrative stat is 
	 'locked' but without negotiation with the DCE.
	
	 For a DCE, this set value represents the subscribed 
	 facilities, agreed to for a time between the DCE and 
	 the DTE and will be reported to the DTE in a 
	 registration confirmation packet, and is writable by a 
	 management station.
	
	 The facilities that may be contained in the set, 
	 indicating subscription, are as follows:
	
	 - ePSN(0),  Extended Packet Sequence Numbering; this 
	   value should only be set by the agent when the 
	   correspoding bit in the X25PLEFacilityAvailability 
	   column is also set.
	
	 - pR(1), Packet Retransmission; this value should only 
	   be set by the agent when the corresponding bit in the 
	   x25PLEFacilityAvailability column is also set.
	
	 - dM(2), D-bit Modification; this value should only be 
	   set by the agent when the corresponding bit in the 
	   x25PLEFacilityAvailability column is also set.
	
	 - sPSN(3), Super Extended Packet Sequence Numbering; 
	   this value should only be set by the agent when the 
	   corresponding bit in the x25PLEFacilityAvailability 
	   column is also set.  Super Extended Packet Sequence 
	   Numbering is not supported in protocol versions 
	   earlier than ITU-T Rec. X.25 (1996).
	
	 - tNAS(4), TOA/NPI Address Subscription.
	
	 Note that for DTE subscribed to the On-line Facility 
	 Registration facility, writing to this column while the 
	 X.25 PLE is operational and locked will result in a 
	 registration request packet being issued to the DCE or 
	 DXE.  Reading the value will return the facilities 
	 reported as subscribed the the DCE in a registration 
	 confirmation packet.
	
	 When the DTE is subscribed to the On-line Facility 
	 Registration facility, writing this value at for a DTE 
	 can result in the generation of a REGISTRATION REQUEST 
	 packet toward the DXE; writing this value at a DXE can 
	 result in the generation of a RESTART INDICATION or 
	 RESET INDICATION packet."

	 A system shall return and error when an attempt is made 
	 to set the value to a value that is not supported by 
	 that system.
	
	 Extended Packet Sequence Numbering and Super Extended 
	 Packet Sequence Numbering are optional user facilities 
	 that require subscription followed by dynamic 
	 invocation on packet switched networks.
	
	 ITU-T Rec. X.25 only permits this value to be set for 
	 an entire DTE.  That is, where the setting applies to 
	 all switched virtual calls and permanent virtual 
	 circuits (logical channels) proviided by the DTE X.25 
	 Packet Layer Entity.  It also permits the packet 
	 sequence numbering scheme to be applied individually to 
	 each logical channel for the DTE X.25 PLE.  When the 
	 network supports the user of multiple modulos at the 
	 same interface, for virtual calls the selection is made 
	 by signalling of the GFI, for permanent virtual 
	 circuits, the modulo is established by subscription."

    DESCRIPTION
	"Specifies the lowest logical channel number used for 
	 outgoing virtual calls, using the LogicalChannelNumber 
	 textual convention.  This is used in conjunction with 
	 the corresponding HOC value, 
	 x25PLELogicalChannelAssignmentHOC, to define a range of 
	 logical channels.  When set to zero(0), no logical 
	 channels are assigned to one-way outgoing virtual 
	 calls.  This is also the default.
	
	 The value must be zero(0) when the corresponding HOC is 
	 set to zero(0), or, otherwise, at least one less than 
	 the value of the corresponding HOC.  The range defined 
	 by the corresponding LOC and HOC values must not 
	 overlap with the other ranges specified for logical 
	 channel assignment.
	
	 Note that this value may be overridden by the 
	 corresponding value in the x25PLEIVMOTable.
	
	 For a DTE subscribed to the On-line Facility 
	 Registration facility, and where the Logical Channel 
	 Assignment facility is indicated as available in the 
	 x25PLEFacilityAvailability column, writing to this 
	 column may invoke the registration procedure.
	
	 When the DTE is not subscribed to the On-line Facility 
	 Registration facility, this value reflects the current 
	 value, agreed to for a time between the DTE and the 
	 DCE.
	
	 When the DTE is subscribed to the On-line Facility 
	 Registration facility, writing this value at for a DTE 
	 can result in the generation of a REGISTRATION REQUEST 
	 packet toward the DXE; writing this value at a DXE can 
	 result in the generation of a RESTART INDICATION or 
	 RESET INDICATION packet."

	"The subscription of the DTE to the Hunt Group facility 
	 as described in ITU-T Recommendation X.2. Expressed as 
	 a TruthValue where a value of 'true(1)' indicates 
	 subscription and a value of false(2) indicates 
	 non-subscription.
	
	 The Hunt Group facility is an optional user faciltiy 
	 that requires subscription only on a circuit switched 
	 or packet switched network.
	
	 Note that neither the Hunt Group facility nor the 
	 Called Line Address Modificiation Notificaiton facility 
	 is not supported by the 1980 version of X.25, x2580(8).
	
	 Hunt Group is an optional user facility agreed for a 
	 period of time.  This user facility, if subscribed to, 
	 distributes incoming calls having an address associated 
	 with the hunt group across a designated grouping of 
	 DTE/DCE interfaces.
	
	 Selection is performed forn an incoming virtual call if 
	 there is at least one logical channel in the ready 
	 state (see X.25/4.1.1), excluding one-way outgoing 
	 logical channels, available for virtual calls on any of 
	 the DTE/DCE interfaces in the group.  Once a virtual 
	 call is assigned to a DTE/DCE interface, it is treated 
	 as a regular call.
	
	 When virtual calls are placed to a hunt group address 
	 in the case that specific addresses have also been 
	 assigned to the individual DTE/DCE interfaces, the 
	 clear indication packet (when no call accepted packet 
	 has been transmitted) or the call connected packet 
	 transferred to the calling DTE may contain the called 
	 DTE address of the selected DTE/DCE interface and the 
	 Called Line Address Modified Notification facility (see 
	 X.25/6.26) indicating the reason why the called DTE 
	 address is different from the one originally requested.
	
	 Virtual calls may be originated by the DTEs on DTE/DCE 
	 interfaces belonging to the hunt group; these are 
	 handled in the normal manner.  In particular, the 
	 calling DTE address transferred to the remote DTE in 
	 the incoming call packet is the hunt group address 
	 unless the DTE/DCE interface has a specific address 
	 assigned.  Permanent virtual circuits may be assigned 
	 to DTE/DCE interfaces belongin to the hunt group.  
	 These permanent vritual circuits are independent of the 
	 operation of the hunt group.  Some networks may apply 
	 virtual call subscription time user facilities in 
	 common to all DTE/DCE interfaces in the hunt group, 
	 place a limit on the number of DTE/DCE interfaces in 
	 the hunt group, and/or constrain the size of the 
	 geographic region that can be served by a single hunt 
	 group."

	"The subscription of the Packet Retransmissions facility

	 a TruthValue where a value of 'true(1)' indicates 
	 subscription and a value of 'false(2)' indicates 
	 non-subscription. If non-subscription, then the 
	 attributes for rejectTimer and rejectCount will have 
	 NULL values.
	
	 Packet Retranmission is an optional user facility 
	 agreed for a period of time.  It is common to all 
	 logical channels at the DTE/DCE interface.  The 
	 facility requires subscription followed by dynamic 
	 invocation on packet switched networks.
	
	 This user facility, if subscribed to, allows a DTE to 
	 requires retransmission of one or several consecutive 
	 DCE data packets from the DCE by transferring across 
	 the DTE/DCE interface a DTE reject packet specifying 
	 the logical channel number and a sequence number P(R).  
	 The value of this P(R) should be within the range from 
	 the last P(R) received by the DCE up to, but not 
	 including, the P(S) of the next DCE data packet to be 
	 transmitted by the DCE.  If the P(R) is outside this 
	 range, the DCE will initated the reset procedure with 
	 the cause 'Local procedure error' and diagnostic #2.
	
	 When received a DTE reject packet, the DCE initiates on 
	 the sepcified logical channel retransmission of the DCE 
	 dat packets, the packet send sequence numbers of which 
	 are starting from P(R), where P(R) is indicated in the 
	 DTE reject packet.  Until the DCE transfers across the 
	 DTE/DCE interface a DCE data packet with a packe send 
	 sequence number equal to the P(R) indicated in the DTE 
	 reject packet, the DCE will consider the receipt of 
	 another DTE reject packet as a procedure error and 
	 reset the logical channel.
	
	 Additional DCE data packets pending inital transmission 
	 may follow the retransmitted packet(s).
	
	 A DTE receive not ready situation indicated by the 
	 transmission of an RNR packet is cleared by the 
	 transmission of a DTE reject packet.
	
	 The conditions under which the DCE ignores a DTE reject 
	 packet, or considers it as a procedure error, are those 
	 described for flow control packets (see Annex C)."

	 Objects in this table support the 'deactivate' action.
	
	 The Deactivate action causes the connection to be 
	 terminated.  The termination should occur as rapidly as 
	 practical, but no particular time constraints are 
	 implied. Typically, this action simulates a disconnect 
	 request received across the service interface. If a 
	 more rapid means for terminating the connection exists, 
	 then this should be used. The termination shall occur 
	 in conformance to the protocol standard. The Managed 
	 Object remains in existence after completion of the 
	 Deactivate action.  It is subsequently deleted when the
