Linux STREAMS (LiS)
===================

This is an incremental release of OpenSS7 Linux STREAMS.  The purpose of
this release is to provide the technical community with a detailed
comparison point for the OpenSS7 Linux Fast-STREAMS releases, which are
superior and that deprecates this package.

THIS CODE HAS TESTED UNSTABLE.  LOADING OR EXECUTING CODE IN THIS
RELEASE WILL CRASH YOUR MACHINE AND COULD INADVETENTLY CAUSE DAMAGE.
THERE IS NO WARRANTY.

The following is an extract from the Installation and Reference Manual:

5.4.2 Alpha Releases
--------------------

"Alpha" release are releases that have received little to no testing,
or that have been tested and contains known bugs or defects that make
the package unsuitable even for testing.  The purpose for an "alpha"
release are the same as for the pre-alpha release, with the additional
purpose that it is an earily release of partially functional code that
has problems that an external developer might be willing to fix
themselves and contribute back to the project.

"Alpha" release packages ship containing warnings that executing the
code can crash machines and might possibly do damage to systems upon
which it is executed.

5.5 Bugs
========

5.5.1 Defect Notices
--------------------

"Linux STREAMS (LiS)", both releases from `OpenSS7' and `GCOM', contany
many known bugs. These are unstable releases.  Although there are no
bugs known to be harmful, the `OpenSS7 Project' has tested the release
and found defects that cause the kernel to lock or crash. Use at your
own risk.  Remember that there is NO WARRANTY(1) and that the package
is no longer actively maintained.

This software has tested unstable.  As such, it can crash your kernel.
Installation of the software could irreparably mangle your header files
or Linux distribution in such a way as to make it unusable.  Crashes
can lock your system and rebooting the system might not repair the
problem.  You can loose all the data on your system.  Because this
software locks or crashes under a large number of test cases in the
test suite, simply running the test cases can cause locks or crashes.
The resulting unstable system could destroy computer hardware or
peripherals making them unusable.  You could void the warranty on any
system on which you run this software. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

5.5.2 Known Defects
-------------------

With the exception of packages not originaly created by the `OpenSS7
Project', the `OpenSS7 Project' software does not ship with known bugs
in any release stage except "pre-alpha".  "Linux STREAMS (LiS)" had
many known bugs at the time of release.

"Linux STREAMS (LiS)" has many known bugs.  Under some architectures,
the test cases in the conformance test suite cause the kernel to lock
or crash.  "Linux STREAMS (LiS)" contains many races and defects and is
unsuitable for production environments.  This section provides a
summary of some (but not all) known defects.

  1. A substantial group of test cases in the "POSIX" conformance test
     suite fail.  This is largely due to non-fatal defects in LiS.

  2. A number of test cases fail under any architecture and result in a
     kernel lock.  In particular if a significant number of modules are
     pushed onto a Stream using I_PUSH, the kernel will lock when the
     Stream is closed.  The number of modules pushed to cause a crash
     depends on the speed of the machine upon which the test case is
     run.  The test case in the test suite pushes 64 modules and has
     always resulted in a kernel lock regardless of the machine speed
     upon which it was tested.  Pushing 20 modules results in a kernel
     lock on some of the `OpenSS7 Project' 2.57GHz test machines.

     As a result, any test case that pushes a number of modules, and
     the performance tests (that push modules for measurement) will
     cause the kernel to lock.

  3. A large number of test cases fail when running under an SMP
     kernel, regardless of the number of processors on the test system.
     These test cases cause the kernel to lock.  The kernel locks are
     apparentlhy due to locking defects in the implementation.  None of
     these implementation defects have been repaired.

  4. The original `LiS-2.18.0' release from `GCOM' has a large number
     of defects that were repaired in the `OpenSS7' `LiS-2.18.1'
     release.

  5. The original `LiS-2.18.0' release has defects in the description
     of data types and handling under 64-bit architectures.  32-bit
     compatibility for 64-bit architectures is all but non-existent in
     the LiS-2.18.0 release.  Because of binary compatibility issues,
     many of these defects persist in the `OpenSS7' `LiS-2.18.1' and
     `LiS-2.18.2' releases.  LiS is largely unusable in a 64-bit and
     almost completely unusable in a mixed architecture.

The work-around for these defects is to not use LiS at all: use the
`OpenSS7 Linux Fast-STREAMS' release instead.  The `OpenSS7 Linux
Fast-STREAMS', being a completely independent implemenation, does not
suffer from this extensive set of LiS defects.
