.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B pipemod
module has the relatively simple task of reversing the sense of the
.B FLUSH
flag bits in
.B M_FLUSH
messages sent in
.I STREAMS
.I fifos
and
.IR pipes .
This must happen at the
.I midpoint
of a
.I fifo
or
.IR pipe ,
so that
.B FLUSHR
becomes
.BR FLUSHW ,
and
.B FLUSHW
becomes
.BR FLUSHR .
.B pipemod
does this, and has no other function.
.sp
To be used appropriately, then,
.B pipemod
must be the first module pushed onto a pipe end or a fifo, but it is
only necessary on one end of a pipe.
.sp
.B pipemod
is not needed if flush handling need not be supported, or if it its
function is supported by other means.
