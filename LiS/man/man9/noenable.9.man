.SH NAME
.B noenable, lis_noenable
\- disables a \fISTREAMS\fR message queue from being scheduled
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP 8
.BI "void noenable(queue_t *" q );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the queue for which to suppress scheduling.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR noenable ()
sets the
.B QNOENB
flag on the specified
.IR q .
This tells the
.I STREAMS
executive that the
.I q
cannot be scheduled for
.BR runqueues ()
by calls to
.BR appq (9),
.BR insq (9),
.BR putq (9)
or
.BR putbq (9)
when these function enqueue a normal priority message.
.BR noenable ()
has no effect on the scheduling of queue service procedures when the queue is
back-enabled,
when
.BR qenable (9)
is called, or when a priority message is enqueued with
.BR appq (9),
.BR insq (9),
.BR putq (9)
or
.BR putbq (9).
.PP
.BR noenable ()
can be cancelled with
.BR enableok (9).
.PP
If
.BR noenable ()
has been called for a
.IR q ,
and
.BR enableok (9)
has not subsequently been called for the same
.IR q ,
a second call to
.BR noenable ()
for the queue will have no effect.
.PP
Whether a queue has been disabled with a call to
.BR noenable ()
can be tested with
.BR canenable (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR noenable ()
can be used to temporarily suspend queue service procedure processing for a
queue for normal priority messages.  This permits data messages to be enqueued
with
.BR putq (9),
.BR putbq (9),
.BR appq (9)
or
.BR insq (9)
without invoking the queue's service procedure.
.PP
This facility can be used to provide Nagle-like algorithms for flow control on
read or write queues.  For example, multiple messages can be enqueued
permitting the queue's service procedure, when later invoked, to coalesce
smaller messages into larger ones.  Such a queue can be pushed by scheduling
the service procedure explicitly with the
.BR qenable (9)
call once a sufficient time period has elapsed, or once a sufficient number of
bytes have been enqueued.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR noenable ()
sets the
.B QNOENB
flag and returns void.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
If the
.I q
passed to
.BR noenable ()
is
.B NULL
or does not point to a queue structure,
then
.BR noenable ()
will silently fail.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR noenable ()
does not remove the queue,
.IR q ,
from the current
.BR runqueues ()
schedule list.  It only sets the
.B QNOENB
flag to indicate whether the queue should be subsequently scheduled.
To stop a queue from being scheduled, use
.BR qprocsoff (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR noenable ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR noenable ()
is MP-safe; however,
if one thread disables a queue with
.BR noenable ()
and another enables the queue with
.BR enableok (9),
there will be a race condition on the
.B QNOENB
flag.

.SH BUGS

.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR noenable ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR noenable ()
uses atomic bit operations and does not require taking the queue write lock.
This makes
.BR noenable ()
safe for use on a write locked stream that has been frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.I LiS
takes the queue spin lock and uses normal bit operations to set the flag.
.IP \(em
.BR noenable ()
may be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.IR "SVR 4.2MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg
.[
suxspg
.]
and
.IR UnixWare \(rg
.[
uw7spg
.]
do not permit
.BR noenable ()
to be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.IR Solaris \(rg
.[
solspg
.]
permits
.BR noenable ()
to be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules should not invoke
.BR noenable ()
on a stream that has previously been frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.IP \(em
.BR noenable ()
called with an invalid
.I q
argument will have an undefined result.
In referenced versions of
.I LiS
.[
LiS
.]
the result is undefined in the same situations due to an
.I LiS
coding error.
Repaired versions of
.I LiS
will make
.BR noenable ()
fail silently in these situations.
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules should never invoke
.BR noenable ()
with an invalid
.I q
argument.
.IP \(em
.BR noenable ()
only supresses the scheduling of queues for normal messages enqueued with
.BR appq (9).
Only
.I LiS
provides the
.BR appq (9)
function so the behaviour of
.BR noenable ()
with regard to
.BR appq (9)
is non-portable.
As with
.BR insq (9)
.I LiS
suppresses the scheduling of queues for any message enqueued with
.BR appq (9).
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules should not use the
.BR appq (9)
function call.
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules using the
.BR appq (9)
function call should not rely on the
.I LiS
behavior with regard to
.BR noenable ().
.IP \(em
.BR noenable ()
does not suppress the scheduling of queues when back-enabling is performed,
when
.BR qenable (9)
is explicitly called, or when priority messages are enqueued with
.BR putq (9),
.BR putbq (9),
.BR insq (9)
or
.BR appq (9).
.IP \(em
.IR AIX \(rg
.[
aixspg
.]
and
.IR UXP/V \(rg
.[
uxpspg
.]
state that
.BR noenable ()
disables the scheduling of queues resulting from a normal priority message
being placed on the queue with
.BR putq (9)
or
.BR putbq (9)
and that it disables scheduling of queues resulting from any message being
placed on the queue with
.BR insq (9).
.I LiS
also follows this behaviour.
.IP \(em
.IR OSF/1 \(rg,
.[
osfspg
.]
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.[
solspg
.]
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg
.[
suxspg
.]
and
.IR UnixWare \(rg
.[
uw7spg
.]
state that
.BR noenable ()
disables the scheduling of queues resulting from a normal priority message
being placed on the queue with
.BR putq (9),
.BR putbq (9)
or
.BR insq (9),
and that the scheduling of queues resulting from back-enabling or high
priority messages being enqueued is never suppressed with
.BR noenable ().
.IP \(em
.IR HP-UX \(rg
.[
hpuxspg
.]
does not talk about
.BR insq (9)
behaviour.
.IP \(em
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules should not rely upon the behaviour of
.BR insq (9)
with regard to high-priority messages when
.BR noenable ()
is in effect.
