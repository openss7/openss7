.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I dp
the data block to test for being a data type. 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Tests whether the data block pointed to by
.I dp
has a data block type.  Data blocks have data type when they are of type
.BR M_DATA ", " M_PROTO ", " M_PCPROTO " or " M_DELAY .
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.PP
.BR isdatablk ()
returns true (1) if the data block pointed to by
.I dp
is of type
.BR M_DATA ", " M_PROTO ", " M_PCPROTO " or " M_DELAY .
.PP
.BR isdatablk ()
returns false (0) if the data block pointed to by
.I dp
is not of type
.BR M_DATA ", " M_PROTO ", " M_PCPROTO " or " M_DELAY .
