.SH NAME

.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP 8
.BI "queue_t *" oq " = OTHER(" q );
.HP 8
.BI "queue_t *" oq " = OTHERQ(" q );

.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the queue for which to find the other queue in the queue pair.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR OTHERQ ()
returns the other queue associated with the queue pair indicated by the queue
pointer
.IR q ,
regardless of whether
.I q
points to the read queue or the write queue of the queue pair.
.PP
.BR OTHERQ ()
is typically and often used to find the opposite queue from a pointer to one of
the queues in a queue pair.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR OTHERQ ()
returns a pointer to the other queue of the queue pair referenced by
.IR q .
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR OTHERQ ()
returns
.BR NULL .
.PP
.BR OTHERQ ()
is typically and often used to find the opposite queue from a pointer to one of
the queues in a queue pair.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR OTHERQ ()
fails, it returns
.BR NULL .
.BR OTHERQ ()
fails when the queue pointer
.I q
is
.BR NULL ;
.I q
does not point to a valid queue structure;
.I q->q_other
is
.BR NULL ;
.I q->q_other
does not point to a valid queue structure.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR OTHERQ ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR OTHERQ ()
is MP-safe; however,
the caller is responsible for the validity of the reference
.IR q .
References to
.I q
from a procedure, call-out or callback predicated on the queue pair to which
.I q
belongs
are guaranteed valid.
The caller must guarantee validity from call-outs, callbacks, soft interrupts
and interrupt service routines not predicated on the queue pair to which
.I q
belongs.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
implements
.BR OTHERQ ()
as a function rather than as the more obvious
macro:
.sp
.nf
#define OTHERQ(__q) __q->q_other
.fi
.PP
The
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
function call is inefficient, particularly as this function is called often
and regularly.
.PP
If the passed in queue pointer,
.IR q ,
is invalid, the result is undefined.
.PP
If the passed in queue pointer,
.IR q ,
is
.BR NULL ,
a kernel oops will occur.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
