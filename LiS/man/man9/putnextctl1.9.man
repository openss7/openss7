.TH PUTNEXTCTL1 9 "$Date: 2005/03/09 23:14:13 $" "$Name:  $" "Linux STREAMS DDI/DKI"
.SH NAME
.B putnextctl1, lis_putnextctl1
\- puts a 1 byte control message on the downstream \fISTREAMS\fR message queue
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP 8
.BI "int " retval " = putnextctl1(queue_t *" q ", int " type ", int " param );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR putnextctl1 ()
creates a one-byte control message of type
.I type
with the one-byte data containing the data
.I param
and invokes the put procedure of the queue next to the queue pointed to by
.I q
to place the message on the subsequent queue.
If
.I type
is a data message and not control message type
.BR putnextctl1 ()
will fail.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.PP
Upon success,
.BR putnextctl1 ()
returns true (1).
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR putnextctl1 ()
returns false (0).
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR putnextctl1 ()
fails and returns false (0) if the specified
.I type
is not a control message type, or if the passed in queue pointer
.I q
is
.BR NULL ;
or, if allocation of the necessary message blocks fails.
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
.BR putnextctl1 ()
is implemented in
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
with a call to
.BR putctl1 (9)
using the
.I q->q_next
pointer for the queue.
.SH BUGS
.PP
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
.BR putnextctl1 ()
will return success even if the operation fails because of the following
conditions:
.IR q " and " q->q_next
are not
.BR NULL ,
but
.I q->q_next
points to something other than a queue structure;
the queue pointed to by
.I q->q_next
has a
.I q_info
pointer of
.BR NULL ;
the queue pointed to by
.I q->q_next
has no put procedure; or the queue pointed to by
.I q->q_next
is closing, or the queue has had put and service routine processing turned off
(e.g. with
.BR qprocsoff (9)).
.B LiS
.[
LiS
.]
should return failure when the operation fails.
