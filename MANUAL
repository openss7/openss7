Abstract
========

This manual provides a 'Installation and Reference Manual' for
'OpenSS7'.

Objective
---------

The objective of this manual is to provide a guide for the 'OpenSS7'
developer when downloading, building, installing and using the 'OpenSS7'
package.

This guide provides information to developers on the downloading,
building, installation and use of the 'OpenSS7' package.

Intent
------

The intent of this manual is to act as an installation guide and
reference manual to the 'OpenSS7' developer.  It is intended to be read
alone and is not intended to replace or supplement the 'OpenSS7' manual
pages.  For a reference for writing code, the manual pages (see
'STREAMS(9)' (*note (*manpages*)STREAMS(9)::)) provide a better
reference to the programmer.

Although this describes the features of the 'OpenSS7' package, OpenSS7
Corporation (http://www.openss7.com/) is under no obligation to provide
any software, system or feature listed herein.

Audience
--------

This manual is intended for a highly technical audience.  The reader
should already be familiar with 'Linux' kernel programming, the 'Linux'
file system, character devices, driver input and output, interrupts,
software interrupt handling, scheduling, process contexts,
multiprocessor locks, administration, kernel dumps, crashes, oops logs,
package managers, the autoconf packaging system, etc.

The guide is intended for installers and maintainers of 'OpenSS7'
software.

Readers of the guide are expected to possess prior knowledge of the
'Linux' and 'UNIX' system, programming, networking, and data
communication.

Agencies
--------

It would be difficult for the OpenSS7 Project to attain the conformance
and certifications that it has without the free availability of
specifications documents and standards from standards bodies and
industry associations.  In particular, the following:

     * 3GPP (Third Generation Partnership Project)
     * ATM Forum
     * EIA/TIA (Electronic Industries Alliance)
     * ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute)
     * ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization)
     * IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers)
     * IETF (The Internet Engineering Task Force)
     * ISO (International Organization for Standardization)
     * ITU (International Telecommunications Union)
     * Mulutiservices Forum
     * The Open Group

Of these, ICAO, ISO, IEEE and EIA have made at least some documents
publicly available.  ANSI is notably missing from the list: at one time
draft documents were available from ANSI (ATIS), but that was curtailed
some years ago.  Telecordia does not release any standards publicly.
Hopefully these organizations will see the light and realize, as the
others have, that to remain current as a standards organization in
today's digital economy requires providing individuals with free access
to documents.

Repository Installation
-----------------------

The simplest way of installing the package is to use the 'OpenSS7'
'repomd' or 'apt' repositories instead of attempting to build from
tarball.  When you already have a the repository set up, the package can
be udpated simply with (one of):

     Fedora:   $> sudo yum update openss7
     CentOS:   $> sudo yum update openss7
     RHEL:     $> sudo yum update openss7
     OpenSUSE: $> sudo zypper update openss7
     SLES:     $> sudo zypper update openss7
     Mageia:   $> sudo uprmi openss7
     Mandriva: $> sudo urpmi openss7
     MES:      $> sudo urpmi openss7
     Ubuntu:   $> sudo aptitude install openss7
     Debian:   $> sudo aptitude install openss7

If you have not yet set up an installation source for the 'OpenSS7'
repositories, one of the following commands will establish repository
access for RPM-based systems:

               $> REPO=http://www.openss7.org/repo/rpms
     Fedora:   $> SUBDIR=fedora/15/$(uname -m)/RPMS/noarch
     CentOS:   $> SUBDIR=centos/5.6/$(uname -m)/RPMS/noarch
     RHEL:     $> SUBDIR=redhat/6.0/$(uname -m)/RPMS/noarch
     OpenSUSE: $> SUBDIR=opensuse/11.4/$(uname -m)/RPMS/noarch
     SUSE:     $> SUBDIR=suse/11.1/$(uname -m)/RPMS/noarch
     Mageia:   $> SUBDIR=mageia/1/$(uname -m)/RPMS/noarch
     Mandriva: $> SUBDIR=mandriva/2011.0/$(uname -m)/RPMS-noarch
     MES:      $> SUBDIR=mes/5.2/$(uname -m)/RPMS/noarch
               $> sudo rpm -Uhv $REPO/$SUBDIR/openss7-repo.noarch.rpm

For DPKG-based systems, one of the following command sequences will
establish repository access for DPKG-based systems:

               $> REPO=http://www.openss7.org/repo/debs/
     Debian:   $> SUBDIR=debian/squeeze/$(dpkg-architecture -a -qDEB_HOST_ARCH)/main
     Ubuntu:   $> SUBDIR=ubuntu/10.04/$(dpkg-architecture -a -qDEB_HOST_ARCH)/main
               $> wget $REPO/$SUBDIR/openss7-repo_all.deb
               $> dpkg -i -D010077 openss7-repo_all.deb

For 'zypper(8)' based systems it may be first necessary to perform:

     OpenSUSE: $> sudo rpm --import https://www.openss7.org/pubkey.asc
     SLES:     $> sudo rpm --import https://www.openss7.org/pubkey.asc

For 'apt(8)' based systems it may be first necessary to perform:

               $> wget https://www.openss7.org/pubkey.asc
     Debian:   $> sudo apt-key add pubkey.asc
     Ubuntu:   $> sudo apt-key add pubkey.asc

For 'yum(8)' based systems, caches should be refreshed with:

     Fedora:   $> sudo yum makecache
     CentOS:   $> sudo yum makecache
     RHEL:     $> sudo yum makecache

For 'zypper(8)' based systems, caches should be refreshed with:

     OpenSUSE: $> sudo zypper refresh-services
     OpenSUSE: $> sudo zypper refresh
     SLES:     $> sudo zypper refresh-services
     SLES:     $> sudo zypper refresh

For 'urpmi(8)' based systems, caches should be refreshed with:

     Mageia:   $> sudo urpmi.update
     Mandriva: $> sudo urpmi.update
     MES:      $> sudo urpmi.update

For 'apt(8)' base systems, caches should be refreshed with:(2)

     Debian:   $> sudo aptitude update
     Ubuntu:   $> sudo aptitude update

Once the repository is set up in this fashion, it should be possible to
install using (one of):

     Fedora:   $> sudo yum install openss7
     CentOS:   $> sudo yum install openss7
     RHEL:     $> sudo yum install openss7
     OpenSUSE: $> sudo zypper install openss7

     MES:      $> sudo urpmi openss7
     Debian:   $> aptitude install openss7
     Ubuntu:   $> aptitude install openss7

The entire process can be undone with:

     Fedora:   $> sudo yum remove openss7 openss7-repo
     CentOS:   $> sudo yum remove openss7 openss7-repo
     RHEL:     $> sudo yum remove openss7 openss7-repo
     OpenSUSE: $> sudo zypper remove openss7 openss7-repo
     SLES:     $> sudo zypper remove openss7 openss7-repo
     Mageia:   $> sudo uprme openss7

     MES:      $> sudo urpme openss7
     Debian:   $> sudo aptitude remove openss7 openss7-repo
     Ubuntu:   $> sudo aptitude remove openss7 openss7-repo

Build Prerequisites
-------------------

When building from source RPM or DSC, the prerequisites for building
must be met.  Most RPM or DEB build prerequisites are automatic;
however, some prerequisites must still be met manually.  When building
from tarball, most prerequisites must be met manually.  The 'configure'
script will inform you of most missing prerequisites and the actions
that must be performed to meet those prerequisites.

Prerequisites for building OpenSS7 package are as follows:

  1. 'Linux' distribution, somewhat 'Linux Standards Base' compliant,
     with a 2.4, 2.6 or 3.x kernel and the appropriate tool chain for
     compiling out-of-tree kernel modules.  Most recent 'Linux'
     distributions are usable out of the box, but some development
     packages must be installed.  For more information, see *note
     Compatibility::.

          - A fairly LSB compliant GNU/Linux distribution.(3)
          - Linux 2.4 kernel (2.4.10 - 2.4.27),
          - Linux 2.6 kernel (2.6.3 - 2.6.39), or
          - Linux 3.x kernel (3.0 - 3.14);
          - glibc2 or better.
          - GNU groff (for man pages).(4)
          - GNU texinfo (for info files).
          - GNU bison and flex (for config programs).
          - net-snmp (for SNMP agents).(5)
          - GNU gcj and classpath (for Java modules).
          - swig (for Java, Tcl, Perl and Ruby interfaces).

The following will meet most additional prerequisites for a CentOS/RHEL
5.5 build host:

     #> yum install bzip2 chkconfig coreutils createrepo doxygen \
             gcc-java ghostscript gjdoc glibc gnupg gnuplot \
             groff gzip ImageMagick kernel-devel latex2html \
             libgcj lsof module-init-tools rpm rpm-build tetex \
             tetex-dvips tetex-latex transfig xz xz-lzma-compat \
             zip

The following will meet most additional prerequisites for a CentOS/RHEL
6.0 build host:

     #> yum install bzip2 chkconfig coreutils createrepo doxygen \
     	gcc-java ghostscript glibc gnuplot groff gzip ImageMagick \
     	java-1.6.0-openjdk-devel java-1.6.0-openjdk-javadoc \
     	kabi-whitelists kernel kernel-devel latex2html libgcj \
     	libgcj-devel lsof module-init-tools net-snmp-devel \
     	perl-devel rpm rpm-build tcl-devel texlive texlive-dvips \
     	texlive-latex texlive-utils transfig xz zip

The following will meet most additional prerequisites for a SuSE Linux
Enterprise 11 build host:

     #> zypper install aaa_base bzip2 coreutils createrepo doxygen \
             fastjar gcc43-gij gcc-java ghostscript-library gjdoc \
             glibc gnuplot gpg2 groff gzip ImageMagick inst-source-utils \
             kernel-default-devel latex2html lsof module-init-tools \
             rpm texlive texlive-latex transfig zip

The following will meet most additional prerequisites for a Debian 6.0
build host:

     #> apt-get install apt-utils bzip2 coreutils createrepo doxygen \
             dpkg dpkg-dev fastjar gcj-jdk gcj-jre-headless ghostscript \
             gnupg gnuplot-nox gnuplot-x11 groff groff-base gzip \
             imagemagick insserv latex2html libc-bin lsof lzma \
             module-init-tools rpm texlive-binaries texlive-font-utils \
             texlive-latex-base transfig xz-utils zip

The package builds and installs kernel modules.  When configuring and
building the package, it is necessary to have the kernel development
package installed.  For the following distributions, use the following
commands:

     Ubuntu:  $> apt-get install linux-headers
     Debian:  $> apt-get install kernel-headers
     Fedora:  $> yum install kernel-devel
     CentOS:  $> yum install kernel-devel

You also need the same version of 'gcc(1)' compiler with which the
kernel was built.  If it is not the default, add 'CC=kgcc' on the line
after './configure', for example:

     $> ../openss7-1.1.7.20150115/configure CC='gcc-3.4'

The package builds and installs SNMP agents.  When configuring and
building the package, it is necessary to have the net-snmp development
packages installed.  For the following distributions, use the following
commands:

     Ubuntu:  $> apt-get install libsnmp libsnmp-perl snmp snmpd \
                     lm-sensors libsnmp-dev libsnmp9-dev libsensors-dev
     Debian:  $> apt-get install libsnmp libsnmp-perl snmp snmpd \
                     lm-sensors libsnmp-dev libsnmp9-dev libsensors-dev
     Fedora:  $> yum install net-snmp net-snmp-perl net-snmp-utils \
                     lm_sensors net-snmp-devel lm_sensors-devel
     CentOS:  $> yum install net-snmp net-snmp-perl net-snmp-utils \
                     lm_sensors net-snmp-devel lm_sensors-devel

The package builds and installs Java archives and compiled Java.  When
configuring and building the package, it is necessary to have the GNU
GCJ Java Compiler front-end and GNU Classpath archives installed.  For
the following distributions, use the following commands:

     Ubuntu:  $> apt-get install gcj
     Debian:  $> apt-get install gcj
     Fedora:  $> yum install gcc-java
     CendOS:  $> yum install gcc-java

Installation
------------

The following commands will download, configure, build, check, install,
validate, uninstall and remove the package:

     $> wget http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/openss7-1.1.7.20150115.tar.xz
     $> tar -xJvf openss7-1.1.7.20150115.tar.xz
     $> mkdir build
     $> pushd build
     $> ../openss7-1.1.7.20150115/configure --enable-autotest --enable-silent-rules
     $> make V=0
     $> make check
     $> sudo make install
     $> sudo make installcheck
     $> sudo make uninstall
     $> popd
     $> sudo rm -rf build
     $> rm -rf openss7-1.1.7.20150115
     $> rm -f openss7-1.1.7.20150115.tar.xz

If you have problems, try building with the logging targets instead.  If
the make of a logging target fails, an automatic problem report will be
generated that can be mailed to The OpenSS7 Project
<bugs@openss7.org>.(6)  Installation steps using the logging targets
proceed as follows:

     $> wget http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/openss7-1.1.7.20150115.tar.xz
     $> tar -xJvf openss7-1.1.7.20150115.tar.xz
     $> mkdir build
     $> pushd build
     $> ../openss7-1.1.7.20150115/configure --enable-autotest --enable-silent-rules
     $> make V=1 compile.log
     $> make check.log
     $> sudo make install.log
     $> sudo make installcheck.log
     $> sudo make uninstall.log
     $> popd
     $> sudo rm -rf build
     $> rm -rf openss7-1.1.7.20150115
     $> rm -f openss7-1.1.7.20150115.tar.xz

See 'README-make' for additional specialized make targets.

For custom applications, see the 'INSTALL' and 'INSTALL-openss7' files
or the see *note Installation::, as listed below.  If you encounter
troubles, see *note Troubleshooting::, before issuing a bug report.

Brief Installation Instructions
-------------------------------

The OpenSS7 package is available from the downloads area of The OpenSS7
Project website (http://www.openss7.org/download.html) using a command
such as:

     $> wget http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/openss7-1.1.7.20150115.tar.xz

Unpack the tarball using a command such as:

     $> tar -xJvf openss7-1.1.7.20150115.tar.xz

The tarball will unpack into the relative subdirectory named after the
package name: openss7-1.1.7.20150115.

The package builds using the GNU 'autoconf' utilities and the
'configure' script.  To build the package, we recommend using a separate
'build' directory as follows:

     $> mkdir build
     $> cd build
     $> ../openss7-1.1.7.20150115/configure

In general, the package configures and builds without adding any special
options to the 'configure' script.  For general options to the
'configure' script, see the GNU 'INSTALL' file in the distribution:

     $> less ../openss7-1.1.7.20150115/INSTALL

For specific options to the 'configure' script, see the
'INSTALL-openss7' file in the distribution, or simply execute the
configure script with the '--help' option like so:

     $> ../openss7-1.1.7.20150115/configure --help

After configuring the package, the package can be compiled simply by
issuing the 'make' command:

     $> make V=0

Some specialized makefile targets exists, see the 'README-make' file in
the distribution or simply invoke the 'help' target like so:

     $> make help | less

After successfully building the package, the package can be checked by
invoking the 'check' make target like so:

     $> make check

After successfully checking the package, the package can be installed by
invoking the 'install' make target (as root) like so:

     $> sudo make install

The 'info' documentation is automatically installed; however, the text,
html and pdf documentation must be installed separately like so:

     $> sudo make install-txt
     $> sudo make install-html
     $> sudo make install-pdf

The test suites that ship with the package can be invoked after the
package has been installed by invoking the 'installcheck' target.  This
target can either be invoked as root, or as a normal user, like so:

     $> make installcheck

(Note: you must add the '--enable-autotest' flag to 'configure', above
for the test suites to be invoked with 'make installcheck'.)

The package can be cleanly removed (including installed documentation)
by invoking the 'uninstall' target (as root):

     $> sudo make uninstall

Then the build directory and tarball can be simply removed:

     $> cd ..
     $> rm -rf build
     $> rm -rf openss7-1.1.7.20150115
     $> rm -f openss7-1.1.7.20150115.tar.xz

Detailed Installation Instructions
----------------------------------

More detailed installation instructions can be found in the *note
Installation::, contained in the distribution in 'text', 'info', 'html'
and 'pdf' formats:

     $> cd ../openss7-1.1.7.20150115
     $> less doc/manual/openss7.txt
     $> lynx doc/manual/openss7.html
     $> info doc/manual/openss7.info
     $> xpdf doc/manual/openss7.pdf

2.1 Background
==============

The OpenSS7 Project (http://www.openss7.org/) was started in 1996 and
made its Web debut in 2000.  The initial objectives of the OpenSS7
Project were to provide an SS7 stack implementation for Linux.  Initial
work on development of the SS7 stack attempted to integrate the SS7
protocol elements into Linux's BSD-like Sockets based networking system.
Early on this approach became problematic.  Although the true BSD
sockets networking system is somewhat amenable to a wider range of
protocols that just the TCP/IP protocol suite, as evidenced by the early
adoption of OSI protocols into BSD 4.3, the incarnation of the system
present in Linux deviates largely from the BSD module in that there is
no clean separation between the socket layer and the protocol layer, and
that the protocol layer cannot actually be stacked in the same fashion
as is possible in BSD. Also, the Linux 'sk_buff' was crude and did not
have the capabilities of the BSD 'mbuf'.  These and other difficulties
led the project, in 2001, to pursue the STREAMS approach to networking.

In 2003, the OpenSS7 Project decided to begin a completely new
implementation of STREAMS for Linux based, on SVR 4.2 documentation,
called 'Linux Fast-STREAMS', or 'LfS'. The development of 'Linux
Fast-STREAMS' culminated with the first production grade release for
Linux 2.4 and 2.6 kernel services at the beginning of 2006.

Beginning in 2001, the OpenSS7 Project has developed STREAMS components
over a wide range of applications, not just SS7.  These components are
divided into groups of components that were released within separate
sub-packages of an OpenSS7 Master Package.  While the separation of
sub-packages suited the needs of maintaining modules and drivers across
multiple STREAMS packages, it led to a significan maintenance load.  In
early 2009, the OpenSS7 Project collapsed these sub-packages into a
single OpenSS7 package significantly reducing the maintenance load and
providing an more straightforward distribution suitable for repository
downloads.

2.2 Package Contents
====================

The "OpenSS7" package is intended as a single build and installation
package for all components available from The OpenSS7 Project
(http://www.openss7.org/).  The package began as a slim framework for
development of the other packages and blossomed into a combined build
and development environment for all OpenSS7 packages.  The package is
currently very mature and provides a simple way for users of the OpenSS7
components to download, build and install all available OpenSS7 Project
components without concern or consideration for intricate dependencies
between components.

Because sub-packages forks such as 'iperf' and 'netperf' have outlived
their usefulness, a new package was generated that collapsed all of the
former subpackages, including STREAMS, into a single release package
containing all OpenSS7 components.

Whereas in the old master package, protocol components and suites were
organized by subpackage, components in the OpenSS7 package are now
organized by protocol suite and application.

The disposition of the old subpackages is as follows:

'openss7-1.1.20150115'
     All 'OpenSS7 Master Package' components have been incorporated into
     the 'openss7-1.1.7.20150115' release.  The last subpackage release

     'Special Shadow File System', 'specfs(5)'.  When 'specfs(5)' (*note
     (*manpages*)specfs(5)::) is mounted, loading of kernel modules for
     'STREAMS' drivers and modules is automatic.

'streams(8)' ('/etc/init.d/streams')
'streams.sh(8)' ('/etc/init.d/streams.sh')

     System V Init Script for the 'Linux Fast-STREAMS' subsystem.  The
     'streams(8)' init script provides the ability to initialize,
     configure and start the 'Linux Fast-STREAMS' subsystem,
     'STREAMS(9)'.  The 'streams(8)' script provides the RedHat-style
     init script, whereas the 'streams.sh(8)' script provides the
     Debian-style init script.

     The primary purpose of this init script is to load 'Linux
     Fast-STREAMS' Stream head and clone driver and to apply system
     control configuration settings against those kernel modules after
     loading.  The configuration of 'STREAMS' is not persistent in the
     kernel module and the kernel modules load with compiled-in
     defaults.  When system controls alter these values, they must be
     applied each time the kernel modules load.

'openss7(8)' ('/etc/init.d/openss7')
'openss7.sh(8)' ('/etc/init.d/openss7.sh')

     System V Init Script for the "ATM" Subsystem.  The 'openss7(8)'
     init script provides the ability to initialize, configure and mount
     the "ATM" subsystem, 'strxnet(5)'.  The 'openss7(8)' script
     provides the RedHat-style init script, whereas the 'openss7.sh(8)'
     script provides the Debian-style init script.

     See 'openss7(8)' (*note (*manpages*)openss7(8)::) for more
     information.

'strerr(8)' ('/etc/init.d/strerr')
'strerr.sh(8)' ('/etc/init.d/strerr.sh')

     System V Init Script for the 'STREAMS Error Logger'.  The
     'strerr(8)' init script provides the ability to initialize,
     configure and start the 'STREAMS Error Logger', 'strerr(8)'.  The
     'strerr(8)' script provides the RedHat-style init script, whereas
     the 'strerr.sh(8)' script provides the Debian-style init script.

'strace(8)' ('/etc/init.d/strace')
'strace.sh(8)' ('/etc/init.d/strace.sh')

     System V Init Script for the 'STREAMS Trace Logger'.  The
     'strace(8)' init script provides the ability to initialize,
     configure and start the 'STREAMS Trace Logger', 'strace(8)'.  The
     'strace(8)' script provides the RedHat-style init script, whereas
     the 'strace.sh(8)' script provides the Debian-style init script.

3.6.2 Administrative Utilities
------------------------------

Following are user utilities for manipulating "INET":

The 'OpenSS7' package builds and installs the following utilities:

'openss7_mknod'
     This is a C-language program that can be used by startup scripts to
     create device nodes for the 'openss7' package.  This utility is
     normally installed in the '/usr/sbin' directory.  See
     'openss7_mknod(8)' (*note (*manpages*)openss7_mknod(8)::) for more
     information.

'openss7'
     This is a 'RedHat'-style System V init script that is installed and
     used to start and stop the 'openss7' package.  Starting consists of
     creating ATM device nodes using 'openss7_mknod' and installing the
     'streams-sctp' and 'streams-tpiperf' modules in the running kernel.
     This init script is normally installed in the '/etc/init.d'
     directory.

'openss7.sh'
     This is a 'Debian'-style System V init script that is installed and
     used to start and stop the 'openss7' package in a similar fashion
     to the 'openss7' script, but in the 'Debian' style.  This init
     script is normally installed in the '/etc/rc.d/init.d' directory.

4.3 Kernel Modules
==================

Developing Linux Fast-STREAMS kernel modules is similar to user space
programs with regard to header files.  '/usr/include/openss7' should be
placed as an include directory to search on the 'gcc' command line.  The
rules for compiling 'Linux' kernel modules and the rules for compiling
STREAMS modules and drivers should be followed.  In particular, several
important intricacies should be considered:

   * The 'gcc' compiler used to compile the kernel modules must be the
     same version of compiler that was used to compile the kernel and
     STREAMS base package.

   * The 'gcc' command line must have the same compile flags that were
     used to compile the kernel and STREAMS base package.  'kbuild' can
     be used to accomplish this.

   * The 'gcc' command line must define several important kernel defines
     including '-DLINUX', '-D__KERNEL__', as well as the base name of
     the module.  Again, 'kbuild' can be used to accomplish this.

   * The 'gcc' command line must include several important files
     directly on the command line, such as, '--include
     /lib/modules/3.17.6-1-ARCH/build/include/linux/autoconf.h' and
     '--include
     /lib/modules/3.17.6-1-ARCH/build/include/linux/modversions.h'.(1)

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The kernel version, '3.17.6-1-ARCH', is just an example.  For the
running kernel, use the output of 'uname -r'.

4.3.1 Kernel Module Building
----------------------------

Support is provided for the development of Linux Fast-STREAMS kernel
modules using 'Kbuild'.

*note Example 4.1: example:kbuild. provides an example listing of a
'Kbuild' makefile for building the 'example' driver.

     MDIR := $(PWD)
     KDIR := /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build
     obj-m := streams_example.o
     streams_example-objs := example.o
     moduledir = /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/extra/

     all: modules
     modules:
             rm -f -- Module.symvers
             cp /usr/src/openss7/$(shell uname -r)/Module.symvers .
             $(MAKE) -C $(KDIR) M=$(MDIR) modules MODFLAGS='-DMODULE -I/usr/include/openss7'

     clean-modules:
             rm -f -- example.o .example.o.cmd
             rm -f -- Module.markers Module.symvers
             rm -f -- streams_example.ko .streams_example.ko.cmd
             rm -f -- streams_example.mod.c streams_example.mod.o .streams_example.mod.o.cmd
             rm -f -- streams_example.o .streams_example.o.cmd
             rm -rf -- .tmp_versions

     install-modules:
             mkdir -p $(moduledir)
             cp streams_example.ko $(moduledir)/streams_example.ko
             test -z "$RPM_BUILD_ROOT" || exit 0
             /sbin/openss7-modules -- --kversion "$(shell uname -r)" --add-modules

     remove-modules:
             rm -f -- $(moduledir)/streams_example.ko
             test -z "$RPM_BUILD_ROOT" || exit 0
             /sbin/openss7-modules -- --kversion "$(shell uname -r)" --remove-modules

Example 4.1: _Example Kbuild Makefile_

Note that the necessary header files are contained in the
'openss7-devel' binary package, and the needed 'Module.symvers' file is
contained in the 'openss7-devel-$(uname -r)' package.

4.3.2 Kernel Module Updates
---------------------------

Kernel modules can be built and installed so that they are automatically
updated when kernels are updated (primarily for security updates),
without having to be recompiled or reinstalled.  The 'OpenSS7' kernel
modules packages support weak updates across a wide range of kernel
versions from a single set of kernel modules, and also automatically
performs weak update of client-supplied dependent kernel modules.

Each distribution has a slightly different approach (detailed in the
sub-sections that follow).  'RedHat'/'Fedora' uses the
'/sbin/weak-modules' script to perform weak updates of modules in the
'extra' kernel modules subdirectory; 'SuSE' uses the
'/usr/lib/module-init-tools/weak-modules' or
'/usr/lib/module-init-tools/weak-modules2' scripts, to update weak
modules in the 'updates', or 'updates' or 'extra', kernel module
subdirectories, resp.  'Debian' systems tend to use the 'Dell' Dynamic
Kernel Module System (DKMS), which is triggered by the installation or
removal of a kernel.

All of these scripts and approaches are lacking in some number of
aspects: therefore, the 'OpenSS7' package uses a supplied
'openss7-modules' script that performs the necessary actions.  The
additional features of the 'openss7-modules(8)' script are detailed in
its manual page, however, following are some of its features:

   * 'openss7-modules(8)' will consider for compatibility and relink any
     kernel modules that depend (or rely) upon an absolute symbol
     address in a given kernel.  Neither the 'RedHat'/'Fedora', 'SuSE
     Code 10', 'weak-modules' scripts, nor the 'SuSE Code 11'
     'weak-modules2' scripts know about absolute symbols, so both can
     weak-update kernel modules that are incompatible with a given
     kernel (due to unsatisfied absolute symbol dependencies).  Only a
     run of the 'openss7-modules(8)' script after any of these
     weak-modules scripts will correct this.

   * 'openss7-modules(8)' understands weak symbols (both exported and
     absolute), and will relink or allow the kernel module loader to
     conditionally link any weak symbols that are compatible with the
     updated module.  Both the 'RedHat'/'Fedora' and 'SuSE Code 10/11'
     'weak-modules' scripts use 'modprobe(8)' with the
     '--dump-modversions' option to determine which kernel modules are
     compatible with which kernels.  However, this does not consider
     versions for weak symbols and will fail to update a kernel module
     that has a weak symbol that is not satisfied by the kernel under
     consideration.  The 'SuSE Code 11' 'weak-moduels2' script does not
     have this problem because it uses 'depmod(8)' to determine module
     compatibility and 'depmod(8)' understands and properly handles
     versions for weak symbols.

   * 'openss7-modules(8)' considers all install modules, regardless of
     whether they are install using a kernel module 'rpm(8)' package, or
     whether they are install manually; and, regardless of which kernel
     module subdirectory in which they reside (other than the 'kernel'
     subdirectory).  The 'RedHat'/'Fedora' 'weak-modules' script only
     considers weak updates from the 'extra' subdirectory to the
     'weak-updates' subdirectory.  The 'SuSE Code 10' 'weak-modules'
     script only considers weak updates from the 'updates' subdirectory
     to the 'weak-updates' subdirectory.  The 'SuSE Code 11'
     'weak-modules2' script considers weak updates from the 'updates'
     and 'extra' directories to the 'weak-updates/updates' and
     'weak-updates/extras' subdirectories.  The 'RedHat'/'Fedora' and
     'SuSE Code 10' 'weak-modules' scripts update kernel modules
     regardless of whether they belong to 'rpm(8)' packages or not, the
     'SuSE Code 11' 'weak-modules2' script will only update kernel
     modules that belong to properly formatted 'SuSE Code 11' kernel
     module 'rpm(8)' packages.

   * 'openss7-modules(8)' will weak-update kernel modules from older
     kernels with kernel modules from new kernels in a given kernel
     allowing client-supplied kernel modules to be out of
     synchronization with the kernel versions for which 'STREAMS' is
     installed.  The 'RedHat'/'Fedora' and 'SuSE Code 10' 'weak-modules'
     scripts only consider symbol sets from a single other kernel
     version.

   * 'openss7-modules(8)' is run at boot time (when necessary) to ensure
     that kernel modules are appropriately updated before the 'STREAMS'
     subsystem is loaded.

   * 'openss7-modules(8)' does not create not update initial ramdisk nor
     ramfs images.

4.3.2.1 RedHat Systems
......................

On recent 'RedHat' distributions and clones (e.g., 'Fedora', 'RHEL',
'CentOS', 'PUIAS', 'Scientific', 'Oracle'), this can be accomplished
without building an RPM, by simply installing the kernel modules into
'/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/extra', where '$(uname -r)' is the name of the
kernel for which the modules were compiled.

When the kernel is updated, the script '/sbin/weak-modules' will be run
and will examine modules contained in the 'extra' sub-directory for
other kernel versions and determine whether the new kernel (and
compatible modules) provides the same symbols as the old kernel (and
compatible modules).  When the existing module is compatible with the
new kernel, a symbolic link is added to the
'/lib/modules/newversion/weak-updates' sub-directory that link to the
module in the older kernel's '/lib/modules/oldversion/extra'
sub-directory.

For this mechanism to work completely the '/sbin/weak-modules' script
must be invoked with the '--add-modules' option when installing the
modules, and with the '--remove-modules' option when removing the
modules.

The '/sbin/weak-modules' script provided with even current 'RHEL'
releases is somewhat flawed and is not always able to update kernel
modules built against 'STREAMS' kernel modules.  Therefore, the supplied
'awk(1)' script '/sbin/openss7-modules' should be used in its stead.  It
is invoked with the '--add-modules' and '--remove-modules' options in
the same fashion as '/sbin/weak-modules'; however, it is not necessary
to provide a list of modules on the standard input of the command.

On 'RedHat' systems it is also possible to provide weak updates by
creating kernel module packages.  *Note Kernel Module Packages::.

4.3.2.2 SuSE Systems
....................

SuSE Code 10 Systems
....................

On 'SuSE Code 10' distributions and clones (e.g., 'SLES', 'SLED',
'OpenSuSE'), weak updates can be accomplished without building an RPM,
by simply installing the kernel modules into '/lib/modules/$(uname
-r)/updates', where '$(uname -r)' is the name of the kernel for which
them modules were compiled.

When the kernel is updated, the script
'/usr/lib/module-init-tools/weak-modules' will be run an will examine
modules contained in the 'updates' sub-directory for the other kernel
versions and determine whether the new kernel (and compatible modules)
provides the same symbols as the old kernel (and compatible modules).
When the existing module is compatible with the new kernel, a symbolic
link is added to the '/lib/modules/newversion/weak-updates' subdirectory
that link to the module in the older kernel's
'/lib/modules/oldversion/updates' sub-directory.

For this mechanism to work completely, the
'/usr/lib/module-init-tools/weak-modules' script must be invoked with
the '--add-modules' option when installing the modules, and with the
'--remove-modules' option when removing the modules.

The '/sbin/weak-modules' script provided with even current 'SuSE'
releases is somewhat flawed and is not always able to update kernel
modules built against 'STREAMS' kernel modules.  Therefore, the supplied
'awk(1)' script '/sbin/openss7-modules' should be used in its stead.  It
is invoked with the '--add-modules' and '--remove-modules' options in
the same fashion as '/usr/lib/module-init-tools/weak-modules'; however,
it is not necessary to provide a list of modules on the standard input
of the command.

SuSE Code 11 Systems
....................

On recent 'SuSE Code 11' distributiones (e.g., 'SLES', 'SLED',
'OpenSUSE'), weak updates cannot normally be accomplished without
building a kernel module package (KMP) RPM. *Note Kernel Module
Packages::.

Nevertheless, the 'OpenSS7' '/sbin/openss7-modules' script is equally
suitable for use with 'SuSE Code 11' systems as it is for use with 'SuSE
Code 10' systems.

4.3.2.3 Debian Systems
......................

On recent 'Debian' distributions and clones (e.g., 'Debian', 'Ubuntu',
'Mint'), weak updates are not normally performed.  It is more typical
for the system to use the 'Dell' Dynamic Kernel Module System (DKMS),
especially for 'Ubuntu'.

4.3.3 Kernel Module Packages
----------------------------

On recent distributions, it is possible to create a kernel module
package (KMP) RPM for STREAMS modules or drivers in a very easy and
straight-forward way.

Example 4.2: _Example Kernel Module Package_

The example uses several macros that are now commonly provided by both
'RedHat' and 'SUSE' systems (although they are implemented different
ways).  Kernel module packages that are build in this way will have
'weak-module' or 'weak-module2' updates applied when installed and when
a kernel is installed.

In general, you can follow the instructions for developing kernel module
packages for the distribution for which you are generating them.  When
using the distribution approach (invoking 'weak-modules' or
'weak-modules2' from '%post' and '%preun'), there are several
limitations of the distribution's packaging system that must be
considered as follows:

   * Typically, the distribution build system can build kernel modules
     for kernel for which there is no kernel actually installed.  This
     is also possible with kernel modules built against 'STREAMS'.
     However, when the kernel modules are installed, the kernel modules
     provinging 'STREAMS' must also be present for the kernel in which
     the dependent modules are installed; otherwise, the 'weak-modules'
     script will fail to update them.  Therefore, for 'RedHat'/'Fedora'
     and 'SuSE Code 10' systems, it is necessary to require that the
     equivalent kernel modules package for 'OpenSS7' is installed.

     Unfortunately, this cannot be accomplished using the
     '%kernel_module_package' rpm spec file macro, and the macro must be
     expanded and altered.

*************

Although 'OpenSS7 Project' software is of high quality, and untested
behaviour is often correct behaviour, the principle of the 'OpenSS7
Project' is to test all functional requirements against the behaviour of
the package in a repeatable validation test suite that can be used to
perform regression, target architecture validation and trouble shooting,
(*note Maturity::, and *note Test Suites::).

=================

When building from source RPM or DSC, the prerequisites for building
must be met.  Most RPM or DEB build prerequisites are automatic;
however, some prerequisites must still be met manually.  When building
from tarball, most prerequisites must be met manually.  The 'configure'
script will inform you of most missing prerequisites and the actions
that must be performed to meet those prerequisites.

Prerequisites for building OpenSS7 package are as follows:

  1. 'Linux' distribution, somewhat 'Linux Standards Base' compliant,
     with a 2.4, 2.6 or 3.x kernel and the appropriate tool chain for
     compiling out-of-tree kernel modules.  Most recent 'Linux'
     distributions are usable out of the box, but some development
     packages must be installed.  For more information, see *note
     Compatibility::.

          - A fairly LSB compliant GNU/Linux distribution.(1)
          - Linux 2.4 kernel (2.4.10 - 2.4.27),
          - Linux 2.6 kernel (2.6.3 - 2.6.39), or
          - Linux 3.x kernel (3.0 - 3.14);
          - glibc2 or better.
          - GNU groff (for man pages).(2)
          - GNU texinfo (for info files).
          - GNU bison and flex (for config programs).
          - net-snmp (for SNMP agents).(3)
          - GNU gcj and classpath (for Java modules).
          - swig (for Java, Tcl, Perl and Ruby interfaces).

The following will meet most additional prerequisites for a CentOS/RHEL
5.5 build host:

     #> yum install bzip2 chkconfig coreutils createrepo doxygen \
             gcc-java ghostscript gjdoc glibc gnupg gnuplot \
             groff gzip ImageMagick kernel-devel latex2html \
             libgcj lsof module-init-tools rpm rpm-build tetex \
             tetex-dvips tetex-latex transfig xz xz-lzma-compat \
             zip

The following will meet most additional prerequisites for a CentOS/RHEL
6.0 build host:

     #> yum install bzip2 chkconfig coreutils createrepo doxygen \
     	gcc-java ghostscript glibc gnuplot groff gzip ImageMagick \
     	java-1.6.0-openjdk-devel java-1.6.0-openjdk-javadoc \

     	perl-devel rpm rpm-build tcl-devel texlive texlive-dvips \
     	texlive-latex texlive-utils transfig xz zip

The following will meet most additional prerequisites for a SuSE Linux
Enterprise 11 build host:

     #> zypper install aaa_base bzip2 coreutils createrepo doxygen \
             fastjar gcc43-gij gcc-java ghostscript-library gjdoc \
             glibc gnuplot gpg2 groff gzip ImageMagick inst-source-utils \
             kernel-default-devel latex2html lsof module-init-tools \
             rpm texlive texlive-latex transfig zip

The following will meet most additional prerequisites for a Debian 6.0
build host:

     #> apt-get install apt-utils bzip2 coreutils createrepo doxygen \
             dpkg dpkg-dev fastjar gcj-jdk gcj-jre-headless ghostscript \
             gnupg gnuplot-nox gnuplot-x11 groff groff-base gzip \
             imagemagick insserv latex2html libc-bin lsof lzma \
             module-init-tools rpm texlive-binaries texlive-font-utils \
             texlive-latex-base transfig xz-utils zip

If you need to rebuild the package from sources with modifications, you
will need a larger GNU tool chain as described in *Note Downloading from
CVS::.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) See *note GNU/Linux Distributions::, for more information.

   (2) If you are using a Debian release, please make sure to install
the groff extension package ('groff_ext'), as it contains the 'refer' or
'grefer' commands necessary for including references in the manual
pages.

   (3) A wide range of net-snmp releases are supported, from UCD-SNMP
4.2.5 through net-snmp 5.7.2.

When installing from the tarball (*note Installing the Tar Ball::), this
distribution is probably compatible with a much broader array of
distributions than those listed above.  These are the distributions
against which the current maintainer creates and tests builds.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Items marked as 'TBD' are scheduled to have support deprecated.
That is, in a future release, the distributions marked 'TBD' will not
longer be validated before release.

6.2.2 Kernel
------------

The 'OpenSS7' package compiles as "Linux" kernel modules.  It is not
necessary to patch the "Linux" kernel to build or use the package.(1)
Nor do you have to recompile your kernel to build or use the package.
OpenSS7 packages use 'autoconf(1)' scripts to adapt the package source
to your existing kernel.  The package builds and runs nicely against
production kernels from the distributions listed above.  Rather than
relying on kernel versions, the 'autoconf(1)' scripts interrogate the
kernel for specific features and variants to better adapt to
distribution production kernels that have had patches applied over the
official kernel.org (http://www.kernel.org/) sources.

6.2.2.1 Compatible Kernels
..........................

The 'OpenSS7' package is compatible with 2.4 kernel series after 2.4.10
and has been tested up to and including 2.4.33.  It has been tested from
2.6.3 up to and including 2.6.38 (with 'RHEL 6.0', 'SLES 11.1' and
'Debian 6.0' patch sets).  It has been tested from 3.0 up to and
including 3.14.  Please note that your mileage may vary if you use a
kernel more recent than 3.2: it is difficult to anticipate changes that
kernel developers will make in the future.  Many kernels in the 2.6 and
3.x series now vary widely by release version and if you encounter
problems, try a kernel within the supported series.

SMP Kernels
...........

UP validation testing for kernels is performed on all supported
architectures.  SMP validation testing was initially performed on UP
machines, as well as on an Intel 3.0GHz Pentium IV 630 with
HyperThreading enabled (2x).  Because HyperThreading is not as
independent as multiple CPUs, SMP validation testing was limited.
Current releases have been tested on dual 1.8GHz Xeon HP servers (2x),
3.0GHz Pentium D (2x), dual quad-core SunFire (8x) servers and dual
hex-core Xeon servers (12x).

XEN Kernels
...........

It should be noted that, while the packages will configure, build and
install against XEN kernels, that problems running validation test
suites against XEN kernels has been reported.  _XEN kernels are
explicitly not supported._  This may change at some point in the future
if someone really requires running OpenSS7 under a XEN kernel.

6.2.2.2 Linux Kernel Upgrades
.............................

The 'OpenSS7' package compiles as "Linux" kernel modules.  Previously,
kernel modules for each and every installed kernel were required.  This
is no longer the case.  The kernel modules installed by the 'OpenSS7'
package now support weak updates across a wide range of kernels in the
series.  This means that it is normally only necessary to build and
install the 'OpenSS7' kernel modules for one kernel in a series.  This
is true for all supported 2.6 and 3.x kernel distributions (and likely
for others as well).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) At a later date, it is possible to move this package into the
kernel, however, with continued resistance to STREAMS from within the
"Linux" developer community, this is currently unlikely.

6.2.3 Architectures
-------------------

The 'OpenSS7' package compiles and installs on a wide range of
architectures.  Although it is believed that the package will work on
all architectures supported by the Linux kernel being used, validation
testing has only been performed with the following architectures:

   * ix86
   * x86_64
   * ppc (MPC 860)
   * ppc64

32-bit compatibility validation testing is performed on all 64-bit
architectures supporting 32-bit compatibility.  If you would like to
validate an OpenSS7 package on a specific machine architecture, you are
welcome to sponsor the project with a test machine.

Major changes for release openss7-1.1.1.20090908
------------------------------------------------

This the third 'OpenSS7 Project' respin of the 'OpenSS7' package.  This
is a production grade release.  All existing validation test suites run
clean on supported distributions, production kernels and architectures.

The 'OpenSS7' package has undergone significant changes, so follow
closely.  In it first incarnation, epoch zero (0), the 'openss7' package
was an add-on package to a now deprecated version of STREAMS. This
changed due to the deprecation of the old versions of STREAMS. In its
second incarnation, epoch one (1), the 'openss7' package contained Linux
Fast-STREAMS and a number of other sub-packages, each capable of
building and installing separately.  This changed due to the increasing
maintenance overhead as additional sub-packages were added.  In its
latest incarnation, epoch two (2), the 'OpenSS7' package is a monolithic
package containing Linux Fast-STREAMS and most of the other subpackages
in a single build package.

Major feature additions since the last public release are:

   - Support for CentOS 5.3 and 2.6.18-128.1.10.el5 kernel.

   - Support for SLES 10 SP2.

   - SNMP agents are more thorough and complete.

   - Java JAIN SS7 OAM, MTP, SCCP, TCAP, INAP, MAP, ISUP, ISDN, H.323,
     IUA, M3UA, SUA, TUA, SPIRITS components, with JAIN JCC 1.2 and
     MSCONTROL.

   - Interfaces provided for major scripting languages including Java,
     Tcl, Perl and Ruby using Swig.

Major packaging changes since the last public release, epoch one (1),
are:

   - The package only compiles with Linux Fast-STREAMS, which is
     included.

   - Only OpenSS7 Project developed modules, drivers, libraries and
     utilities have been included.

   - Forks of other test utilities such as Iperf and Netperf have been
     removed.

   - Sub-package source and installation sub-directories have all been
     collapsed into the one 'openss7' sub-directory.

   - A single tarball, SRPM and DSC generates a simple set of 3 binary
     RPMs or DEBs.

   - The entire package is now released under the Affero GNU Public
     License Version 3; however, commercial licensing is also available
     for the entire package.

Major upgrades from the last public release are:

   - Updated build system to 'swig-1.3.39'.

   - Updated build system to 'automake-1.11' with full silent build.

   - Excluded deprecated sub-packages as follows:
          - 'sctp-0.2.27'
          - 'iperf-2.0.8'
          - 'netperf-2.3.7'
          - 'osr61-0.9.2.3'

   - Documentation license for all documentation upgraded to GFDL 1.3
     with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts and no Back-Cover
     Texts, for full Debian policy compatibility.

   - Updated build system tool chain to 'm4-1.4.13', 'automake-1.10.2',
     'bison-2.4.1', 'libtool-2.2.6a', 'texinfo-4.13a'.

   - Addition of the following sub-packages:
          - 'stratm-0.9.2.1'
     This subpackage was then instantly absorbed into the new 'OpenSS7'
     package.

   - Significant feature updates were made to:
          - 'strchan-0.9.2.4'
          - 'strsock-0.9.2.4'
          - 'strnsl-0.9.2.4'
          - 'sigtran-0.9.2.4'

   - Significant rework of the 'strchan' sub-package into the 'strss7',
     'strisdn', 'strx25' and 'striso' packages.  One single driver now
     meets the needs of all sub-packages.

   - Completion of the 'strsock' package, moves from pre-alpha to beta.

   - The 'strnsl' subpackage moves from alpha to production.

   - Significant completion of the 'sigtran' package: all components
     moved back to production.

Major maintenance items since the last public release are:

   - Fixed hash races in open and close.  This was service affecting
     under heavy open/close loads.  (Bug# openss7 006.)

   - Fixed reference counting imbalance when entering and leaving
     synchronization queues.  (Bug# openss7 005.)

   - Fixed reference counting imbalance when syncrhonization queues are
     used on module.  (Bug# openss7 004.)

   - Fixed timer reporting in the pstrlog() call resulting in near-epoch
     invalid timestamps.  This was an annoyance.  (Bug# openss7 003.)

   - Fixed assurances in untimeout and unbufcall utilities.  This could
     be service affecting on many-way machines.  (Bug# openss7 002.)

   - Timer cancellation directly from ICS races removed.  This could be
     service affecting on many-way machines.  (Bug# openss7 002.)

   - Corrected removal of SLAP_NO_REAP flag from recent kernels causing
     timeout problems on many-way machines under memory pressure.  (Bug#
     openss7 001.)

For complete detail on maintenance items, see 'BUGS'
(http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/openss7/BUGS) in the release.

_This is a public, stable, production grade release of the package: it
deprecates previous releases.  Please upgrade to the current release
before reporting bugs._

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
'rpm(8)' (*note (*manpages*)rpm(8)::) and 'dpkg(1)' (*note
(*manpages*)dpkg(1)::) based distributions, and can be used on
production kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released strictly under the 'GNU Affero General
Public License Version 3'; however, commercial licensing is available.
The release is available as an 'autoconf(1)' (*note
(*manpages*)autoconf(1)::) tarball, SRPM, DSC, and a set of binary RPMs
and DEBs for popular distributions.  See the package page
(http://www.openss7.org/openss7_pkg.html) for the 'autoconf(1)' (*note
(*manpages*)autoconf(1)::) tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and binary RPMs and
DEBs.  See the repository page (http://www.openss7.org/repos.html) for

Major changes for release openss7-1.1.1.20090622
------------------------------------------------

This release was only released internally.

Major changes for release openss7-0.9.2.G
-----------------------------------------

This is the sixth public release of the OpenSS7.  See 'README' in the
release for a sub-package listing.  Most of the sub-packages in the
release are production grade for 'Linux Fast-STREAMS'. All existing
validation test suites run clean on supported distributions and
architectures.

The 'OpenSS7' is not released as often as the sub-packages.  As
sub-packages are released more often, to rebuild the master package with
a new sub-package release, simply replace the directory to which the
sub-package belongs with the unpacked sub-package release and then
rebuild the master package.  This release provides support for recent
distributions and tool chains.

Major features since the last public release are as follows:

   - License upgrade to 'AGPL Version 3'.

   - Modifications to build under 'Fedora' '2.6.22.5-49' kernel.  These
     changes also support '2.6.22.9-91.fc7' kernel.  Modifications to
     build under 'Fedora' '2.6.25-45.fc9' and '2.6.26.5-45.fc9' kernels.
     Documented 'lib32gcc1' problem on Ubuntu.  Noted problem running
     under XEN kernels.  XEN kernels are not yet supported.  Added
     'MODULE_VERSION' to all modules and drivers.

   - Ability to strap out major documentation build and installation
     primarily for embedded targets.  Improvements to common build
     process for embedded and cross-compile targets.  Cross-compile
     fixes (strap out 'AC_FUNC_REALLOC' macro when cross-compiling).
     Conversion of RPM spec files to common approach for major
     subpackages.

     Build system now builds 'yum(8)' (*note (*manpages*)yum(8)::)
     repositories for RPMs and 'apt-get(8)' (*note
     (*manpages*)apt-get(8)::) repositories for DEBs.  Installation
     documentation has been updated to include details of repository
     install sourcesref.

   - Higher performance and updated performance papers.
   - Updated tool chain to 'm4-1.4.12', 'autoconf-2.63' and
     'texinfo-4.13'.  Support for 'flex 2.5.33' in maintainer mode.

   - Updated references database for manual pages and roff documents.

   - Added the following major sub-packages to the master build (and
     release):

          - 'strx25-0.9.2.1'

   - All of the major subpackages that are at production release have
     maintenance upgrades for new production kernels, distributions and
     tool chains.  Many of the major subpackages have greatly expanded
     documentation and provide additional modules and drivers not
     previously available in public releases.  Significant feature
     updates were made to:

          - 'strxns-0.9.2.7'
          - 'strinet-0.9.2.7'
          - 'strchan-0.9.2.4'
          - 'strx25-0.9.2.1'
          - 'striso-0.9.2.4'
          - 'strss7-0.9a.8'
          - 'sigtran-0.9.2.4'

     Please see the individual 'NEWS' files in each of the subpackages
     for more information.

_This is a public stable production grade release of the package: it
deprecates previous releases.  Please upgrade to the current release
before reporting bugs._

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production kernels
without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the 'GNU Affero General Public
License Version 3'.  The release is available as an 'autoconf' tarball,
SRPM, DSC, and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the downloads page
(http://www.openss7.org/download.html) for the 'autoconf' tarballs,
SRPMs and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and binary RPMs and DEBs, see
the openss7 package page (http://www.openss7.org/openss7_pkg.html).

the release for more information.  Also, see the 'openss7.pdf' manual in
the release (also in html <http://www.openss7.org/openss7_manual.html>).

For the news release, see <http://www.openss7.org/rel20081029_L.html>.

Major changes for release openss7-0.9.2.F
-----------------------------------------

This is the fifth public release of the OpenSS7.  See 'README' in the
release for a sub-package listing.  Most of the sub-packages in the
release are production grade for 'Linux Fast-STREAMS'. All existing
validation test suites run clean on supported distributions and
architectures.

The 'OpenSS7' is not released as often as the sub-packages.  As
sub-packages are released more often, to rebuild the master package with
a new sub-package release, simply replace the directory to which the
sub-package belongs with the unpacked sub-package release and then
rebuild the master package.  This release provides support for recent
distributions and tool chains.

Major features since the last public release are as follows:

   - Support build on openSUSE 10.2.

   - Support build on Fedora 7 and 2.6.21 kernel.

   - Support build on CentOS 5.0 (RHEL5).

   - Support build on Ubuntu 7.04.

   - Updated to gettext 0.16.1.

   - Changes to support build on 2.6.20-1.2307.fc5 and 2.6.20-1.2933.fc6
     kernel.

   - Supports build on Fedora Core 6.

   - Support for recent distributions and tool chains.

Major changes for release openss7-0.9.2.E
-----------------------------------------

This is the fourth public release of the OpenSS7.  See 'README' in the
release for a sub-package listing.  Most of the sub-packages in the
release are production grade for 'Linux Fast-STREAMS'. All existing
validation test suites run clean on supported distributions and
architectures.

It is unlikely that the 'OpenSS7' will be released as frequently as
before.  Sub-packages will be released more often.  To rebuild the
master package with a new sub-package release, simply replace the
directory to which the sub-package belongs with the unpacked sub-package
release and then rebuild the master package.  This release provides
support for recent distributions and tool chains.

Major features since the last public release are as follows:

   - Addition of the 'osr61' sub-package that contains Dialogic(R) Open
     System Release 6.1 version 239 GPL drivers.

   - A few minor corrections to the common build process.

   - Support for autoconf 2.61, automake 1.10 and gettext 0.16.

   - Support for Ubuntu 6.10 distribution and bug fixes for i386
     kernels.

   - The package now looks for subpackages with a version number as
     unpacked by separate tarball.

Major changes for release openss7-0.9.2.D
-----------------------------------------

This is the fourth public release of the OpenSS7.  The sub-packages have
been reorganized for this release.  See 'README' in the release for a
sub-package listing.  Aside from sub-package reorganization, the major
difference from previous release is that this release no longer contains
'LiS'. Too many of the sub-packages will not even build against 'LiS'
because of its Stream head deficiencies.

Most of the sub-packages in the release are production grade for 'Linux
Fast-STREAMS'. All existing validation test suites run clean on
supported distributions and architectures.  The packages build better
Debian/Ubuntu .deb files.

It is unlikely that the 'OpenSS7' will be released as frequently as
before.  Sub-packages will be released more often.  To rebuild the
master package with a new sub-package release, simply replace the
directory to which the sub-package belongs with the unpacked sub-package
release and then rebuild the master package.

The release provides the following enhancements and fixes:

   - Added the following sub-packages to the master build (and release):

          - 'strnsl-0.9.2.1'
          - 'strbcm-0.9.2.1'
          - 'striso-0.9.2.1'
          - 'strsock-0.9.2.1'
          - 'strtty-0.9.2.1'
          - 'strutil-0.9.2.1'

   - Automated release file generation making for vastly improved and
     timely text documentation present in the release directory.

   - This release candidate includes the changes made to the strsctp
     drivers at the 2006 SCTP Interop at the University of British
     Columbia.  This version was interoperability tested with all
     implementations present.

   - Better support for Ubuntu and recent 'gcc' compilers, including
     debian script corrections.

   - Support for most recent 2.6.18 kernels (including Fedora Core 5
     with inode diet patchset).

   - Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against
     64-bit kernel modules and drivers.  The 'make installcheck' target
     will now automatically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
     compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.

   - Added versions to all library symbols.

   - Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.

   - Dropped support for 'LiS'.

   - Start assigning majors at major device number 231 instead of major
     device number 230.  Assign major device number 230 explicitly to
     the clone device.  Package will now support extended ranges of
     minor devices on 2.6 kernels under Linux Fast-STREAMS only.
     'streams' now supports expanded addressable minor device numbers,
     permitting 2^16 addressable minor devices per major device number
     on 2.6 kernels: LiS cannot support this change.

   - Better detection of SuSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
     distributions: support for additional SuSE distributions on ix86 as
     well as x86_64.  Added distribution support includes SLES 9, SLES 9
     SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE 10.1.

   - Improvide compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent
     'gcc' compilers and some idiosyncratic beahviour for some
     distributions (primarily SuSE).

   - Optimized compilation is now available also for user level programs
     in addition to kernel programs.  Added new '--with-optimize' option
     to 'configure' to accomplish this.

   - Added '--disable-devel' 'configure' option to suppress building and
     installing development environment.  This feature is for embedded
     or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
     environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).

   - Added 'send-pr' script for automatic problem report generation.

   - Each package will not build 'doxygen(1)' html documentation with
     the 'make doxy' target.  See 'make help' or 'README-make' in the
     distribution for more information.

Major changes for release openss7-0.9.2.D.rc3
---------------------------------------------

Third release candidate.

   - The package will now build doxygen(1) html documentation with the
     'doxy' make target.  See 'make help' or README-make in the
     distribution for more information.

   - Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against
     64-bit kernel modules and drivers.  The 'make installcheck' target
     will now automatically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
     compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.

   - Added complete documentation and 'Installation and Reference
     Manual' for the 'OpenSS7' (this manual).

   - Added the following sub-packages to the master build (and release):

          - 'strbcm-0.9.2.1'
          - 'striso-0.9.2.1'
          - 'strsock-0.9.2.1'
          - 'strtty-0.9.2.1'
          - 'strutil-0.9.2.1'

   - Automated release file generation making for vastly improved and
     timely text documentation present in the release directory.

   - Dropped support for 'LiS'.

   - Sub-packages will now support extended ranges of minor devices on
     2.6 kernels under 'Linux Fast-STREAMS' only.

   - This release candidate provides support for additional SuSE
     distributions on ix86 as well as x86_64.  Added distribution
     support includes SLES 9, SLES 9 SP2, SLES 9 SP3, SLES 10, SuSE
     10.1.

   - This release candidate includes the changes made to the strsctp
     drivers at the 2006 SCTP Interop at the University of British
     Columbia.  This version was interoperability tested with all
     implementations present.

This was an subscriber release.

Major changes for release openss7-0.9.2.D.rc2
---------------------------------------------

Second release candidate.

This release candidate also contains the results of performance testing
of the new second generation UDP driver (implemented completely in
STREAMS instead of using an internal socket).

This release candidate also contains support for SuSE 10.1.

This was an subscriber release.

Major changes for release openss7-0.9.2.Drc1
--------------------------------------------

First release candidate.

   - Release candidate for Mark Fugate.
   - Added -enable-devel configure option for embedded targets.
   - Added send-pr script for automatic problem report generation.

This was an subscriber release.

Major changes for release openss7-0.9.2.C
-----------------------------------------

Distribution check for entire master package.  Trying to get master
package into form where it can be released as a complete package.

This was a public release.

Major changes for release openss7-0.9.2.B
-----------------------------------------

Minor changes for wider release, better master packaging and bug fixes.

This was a public release.

Major changes for release openss7-0.9.2.A
-----------------------------------------

With this release version numbers were changed to reflect an upstream
version only to be consistent with other OpenSS7 package releases.  All
RPM release numbers will be -1$(PACKAGE_RPMEXTRA) and all Debian release
numbers will be '_0'.  If you wish to apply patches and release the
package, please bump up the release number and apply a suitable release
suffix for your organization.  We leave Debian release number _1
reserved for your use, so you can still bundle the source in the .dsc
file.

Major changes for this release include build against Linux 2.6 kernels
and popular distributions based on the 2.6 kernel as well as wider
distribution support.

This was a public release.

Initial release openss7-0.9.2-1
-------------------------------

Initial autoconf/RPM release of the OpenSS7 master package.

This master package contains all other OpenSS7 releases.

6.4 Maturity
============

The 'OpenSS7 Project' adheres to the following release philosophy:

   * pre-alpha release
   * alpha release
   * beta release
   * gamma release
   * production release
   * unstable release

6.4.1 Pre-Alpha Releases
------------------------

"Pre-alpha" releases are releases that have received no testing
whatsoever.  Code in the release is not even known to configure or
compile.  The purpose of a pre-alpha release is to make code and
documentation available for inspection only, and to solicit comments on
the design approach or other characteristics of the software package.

"Pre-alpha" release packages ship containing warnings recommending that
the user not even execute the contained code.

6.4.2 Alpha Releases
--------------------

"Alpha" releases are releases that have received little to no testing,
or that have been tested and contains known bugs or defects that make
the package unsuitable even for testing.  The purpose for an "alpha"
release are the same as for the pre-alpha release, with the additional
purpose that it is an early release of partially functional code that
has problems that an external developer might be willing to fix
themselves and contribute back to the project.

"Alpha" release packages ship containing warnings that executing the
code can crash machines and might possibly do damage to systems upon
which it is executed.

6.4.3 Beta Releases
-------------------

"Beta" releases are releases that have received some testing, but the
testing to date is not exhaustive.  "Beta" release packages do not ship
with known defects.  All known defects are resolved before distribution;
however, as exhaustive testing has not been performed, unknown defects
may exist.  The purpose for a "beta" release is to provide a baseline
for other organizations to participate in the rigorous testing of the
package.

"Beta" release packages ship containing warnings that the package has
not been exhaustively tested and that the package may cause systems to
crash.  Suitability of software in this category for production use is
not advised by the project; however, as always, is at the discretion of
the user of the software.

6.4.4 Gamma Releases
--------------------

"Gamma" releases are releases that have received exhaustive testing
within the project, but external testing has been minimal.  "Gamma"
release packages do not ship with known defects.  As exhaustive internal
testing has been performed, unknown defects should be few.  Please
remember that there is NO WARRANTY on public release packages.

"Gamma" release packages typically resolve problems in previous "beta"
releases, and might not have had full regression testing performed.
Suitability of software in this category for production use is at the
discretion of the user of the software.  "The OpenSS7 Project"
recommends that the complete validation test suites provided with the
package be performed and pass on target systems before considering
production use.

6.4.5 Production Releases
-------------------------

"Production" releases are releases that have received exhaustive testing
within the project and validated on specific distributions and
architectures.  "Production" release packages do not ship with known
defects.  Please remember that there is NO WARRANTY on public release
packages.

"Production" packages ship containing a list of validated distributions
and architectures.  Full regression testing of any maintenance changes
is performed.  Suitability of software in this category for production
use on the specified target distributions and architectures is at the
discretion of the user.  It should not be necessary to preform
validation tests on the set of supported target systems before
considering production use.

6.4.6 Unstable Releases
-----------------------

"Unstable" releases are releases that have received extensive testing
within the project and validated on a a wide range of distributions and
architectures; however, is has tested unstable and found to be suffering
from critical problems and issues that cannot be resolved.  Maintenance
of the package has proved impossible.  "Unstable" release packages ship
with known defects (and loud warnings).  Suitability of software in this
category for production use is at the discretion of the user of the
software.  "The OpenSS7 Project" recommends that the problems and issues
be closely examined before this software is used even in a
non-production environment.  Each failing test scenario should be
completely avoided by the application.  'OpenSS7' beta software is more
stable that software in this category.

6.5 Bugs

6.5.1 Defect Notices
--------------------

"OpenSS7" could contain unknown defects.  This is a "beta" release.
Some defects could be harmful.  Validation testing has been performed by
the 'OpenSS7 Project' on this software for only a restricted set of
systems.  The software might fail to configure or compile on other
systems.  The 'OpenSS7 Project' recommends that you do not use this
software for purposes other than validation testing and evaluation, and
then only with care.  Use at your own risk.  Remember that there is NO
WARRANTY.(1)

This software is beta software.  As such, it might crash your kernel.
Installation of the software might mangle your header files or Linux
distribution in such a way as to make it unusable.  Crashes could lock
your system and rebooting the system might not repair the problem.  You
can possibly lose all the data on your system.  Because this software
might crash your kernel, the resulting unstable system could possibly
destroy computer hardware or peripherals making them unusable.  You
might void the warranty on any system on which you run this software.
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

6.5.2 Known Defects
-------------------

With the exception of packages not originally created by the 'OpenSS7
Project', the 'OpenSS7 Project' software does not ship with known bugs
in any release stage except "pre-alpha".  "OpenSS7" had no known bugs at
the time of release.

6.5.3 Defect History
--------------------

This section contains historical bugs that were encountered during
development and their resolutions.  This list serves two purposes:

  1. It captures bugs encountered between releases during development
     that could possibly reoccur (and the Moon is made of blue cheese).
     It therefore provides a place for users to look if they encounter a
     problem.

  2. It provides a low overhead bug list between releases for developers
     to use as a 'TODO' list.

Some portions of this package are not completely implemented yet, so the
bugs for those portions are still being designed and will not be
available until a later date.  Most of the package is complete and for
the most part bugs are currently available.

     The 't_alloc(3)' function was incorrectly returning a TLOOK error

     A number of functions in 'strlookup.c' were moving the found item
     in the hash collision list to the head of the list; however, a
     number of these functions were being called with a read lock
     instead of a write lock on the corresponding hash table.  This
     caused crashes on kernels checking for list corruption on SMP
     machines under heavy open/close loads.  The movement of the found
     entry to the head of the collision list has dubious performance
     advantages (as the hash entries are cached).  Therefore, the
     practice has been removed (actually suppressed).  Thanks to Tony
     Abo at HiTech for the report leading to this bug.

     There was an 'qput(9)'/'qget(9)' reference counting imbalance in
     the 'enter_syncq_writer(9)', 'enter_inner_syncq_func(9)' and
     'enter_inner_syncq_putp(9)' functions.  The most symptomatic of
     these was the 'enter_inner_syncq_putp(9)' function that affected
     regular 'put(9s)' (*note (*manpages*)put(9s)::) and 'putnext(9)'
     (*note (*manpages*)putnext(9)::) functions on synchronized modules
     and drivers having an inner perimeter.  The reference imbalance
     resulted in leaking the module queue pair, stream head and stream
     head queue pair on driver close.

     Untimeout and unbufcall did not wait until the callback returned
     before returning when there was a collision between a cancellation
     of an event and the callback for the event.  Linux Fast-STREAMS now
     makes this assurance, provided that the cancellation is not being
     invoked from within the same thread as the callback (i.e.
     untimeout called from an ISR interrupting the callback, or, say,
     from the callback itself) in which case it returns immediately.

     Also, additional timer problems were encountered.  Cancelling
     timers from within an ISR did not have sufficient list protection
     (irq suppression) potentially resulting in list corruption or queue
     reference counting problem.

'openss7 001. 2008-12-16T08:17:47+0000'

     Somewhere about Linux kernel '2.6.17', and during the
     'openss7-0.9.2.D.rc2' master package release, it was discovered
     that SLABs no longer supported the SLAB_NO_REAP flag.
     Unfortunately, the 'seinfo_ctor(9)' function was assuming that the
     SLAB_NO_REAP flag was being recognized.  This means that over the
     span of some several days on system heavily using timers that a
     slab corruption would eventually occur resulting in a kernel crash,
     particularly on x86_64 kernels.  The 'seinfo' slab functions have
     been rewritten to not expect the SLAB_NO_REAP feature.  There was
     also a minor possibility of a strevent structure identifier overlap
     after an extremely long period of intensive operation, and that has
     been fixed as well.  Thanks to Angel Diaz for reporting this bug.

     'putnext(q, mp)' was checking whether procedures had been turned

     A list delete corruption bug in the STREAMS driver and module

'streams 023. 2008-10-11T19:36:23+0000'

     Not really a bug, but newer (2.6.25) kernels no longer permit
     registration of binary identifiers for sysctls (i.e.  CTL_NAME).
     The proc filesystem entries (i.e.  PROCNAME) are still permitted
     and CTL_NAME should be set to zero for these kernels.  Added a
     check for the existence of symbol 'sysctl_check_table(9)' to
     identify when binary registration is forbidden.  Another related
     problem is that when binary registration of system controls is not
     possible, 'sysctl(2)' (*note (*manpages*)sysctl(2)::) becomes
     worthless.  Unfortunately, the STREAMS MIB agent was written to use
     'sysctl(2)' (*note (*manpages*)sysctl(2)::) and needs to be
     rewritten to use the '/proc/sys' filesystem instead ala 'sysctl(8)'
     (*note (*manpages*)sysctl(8)::).

     When overriding 32-bit compatability on input-output controls
     conflicting from the CDROM block device with STREAMS input-output
     controls, the override was not properly passing CDROM input-output
     controls through due to a missing break statement in the override
     loop.  This bug affected pre-2.6.11 kernels, likely manifesting
     itself in a non-function CDROM device while STREAMS was loaded.

     Not really a bug (for STREAMS), but when the 'streams.ko' kernel
     module is loaded, the 'crash(8)' (*note (*manpages*)crash(8)::)
     debugger will not debug a running kernel because it finds the
     'runqueues(9)' exported function in the 'streams.ko' module instead
     of the the static one from the kernel.  This has been temporarily
     renamed by macro to 'srunqueues(9)' (notice the leading 's') until
     'crash(8)' (*note (*manpages*)crash(8)::) learns to do the right
     thing and check that the symbol it looks up comes from the kernel
     instead of a kernel module.

'streams 017. 2008-04-10T15:17:30+0000'

     When 'M_DATA' is sent upstream followed by 'M_HANGUP', 'read(2s)'
     (*note (*manpages*)read(2s)::) is returning zero (0) and not
     permitting the data associated with the 'M_DATA' to be read.  This
     is a bug per documentation.  'read(2s)' (*note
     (*manpages*)read(2s)::) should operate as normal following a hangup
     until all data is read and then return zero (0).

     The difficulty is that when waking up from a read sleep or when
     entering read the hangup condition was generating an internal
     '[ESTRPIPE]' error.  This was altered so that '[ESTRPIPE]' is only
     returned during the hangup condition after the read queue has been
     tested and the caller is about to sleep on read.

     Test cases 3.2.1, 3.5.1 and 3.6.1 in the test-streams test suite
     executable were altered to validate the fix for this case and

     _*workaround*_ in 'strsctp-0.9.2.8'

     The workaround is to ignore the flag for now.  Either Linux network
     drivers need to start supporting SCTP checksum when they set the

     SCTP. The workaround is to not believe that the driver does SCTP
     checksum offload when NETIF_HW_CSUM is set.

     choked on building 32-bit libraries and applications on an x86_64
     system under Ubuntu Fiesty (7.04).  While most other distributions
     include the 'gcc' 32-bit compatibility libraries for 64-bit
     architectures with a 32-bit emulation mode, Ubuntu (and maybe
     Debian too) does not.  The Ubuntu 7.04 package that is missing is
     the 'lib32gcc1' package.  There are two workarounds to this
     difficulty: add the 'lib32gcc1' package (with apt), or add the
     '--disable-32bit-libs' flag to 'configure'.

'strnsl 002. 2007-06-20T15:22:19-0600'

     The libtirpc package for current releases of GNU/Linux including
     NFS4 has usurped a broken /etc/netconfig file for use by its broken
     implementation of TI-RPC. So when strnsl and more importantly the
     strinet package installs its /etc/netconfig entries, the libtirpc
     package breaks.  To avoid this problem, I think that the best
     approach is to install a libtirpc entry (or a copy of the broken
     /etc/netconfig) into the /etc/netconfig.d subdirectory when strnsl
     installs and restore it to /etc/netconfig when strnsls removes.

     Fixed in the current release: the actual fix involves not
     calculating the /etc/netconfig file from the /etc/netconfig.d
     subdirectory entries when an /etc/netconfig file exists that we
     have not generated.

     Found the most obnoxious of bugs.  When testing on loopback, more
     than 255 calls were being made to 'dupb(9)' (*note
     (*manpages*)dupb(9)::) causing the DB_REF field of the data block
     to wrap to zero, causing an incorrect reference count.

'streams 014. 2007-05-17T21:48:24+0000'

     The 'dupb(9)' (*note (*manpages*)dupb(9)::) utility had an
     obnoxious bug where it permitted the DB_REF count to wrap to zero,
     causing buffer allocation and freeing problems.  This was very
     difficult to debug.  'dupb(9)' (*note (*manpages*)dupb(9)::) now
     fails if the reference count has reached 255.  When 'dupb(9)'
     (*note (*manpages*)dupb(9)::) fails, the user should check if the
     reference count has reached 255, and if it has, attempt a deep
     'copyb(9)' (*note (*manpages*)copyb(9)::) instead.  At some point
     it might be useful to have STREAMS do the deep copy automatically.
     This was discovered in 'strsctp' loopback tests where message
     blocks are rapidly duplicated for retransmission.

     The log driver, strace, strerr and strclean utilities had some
     bugs.  The 'strsctp' driver now makes extensive use of 'strlog(9)'

     driver and utilities have been corrected.  These facilities are now
     production grade.

     It appears that 'Ubuntu 6.10' has a rather broken implementation of
     the LSB 'install_init' that has been inherited from Debian (a
     python script, none the less).  This implementation refuses to
     properly install a disabled service (one with an empty or missing
     Default-Start: tag), but, rather invokes updated-rc.d in such a way
     that the init script is started at runlevels '2 3 4 5' instead.
     This was causing problems with the strace and strerr services which
     are normally installed disabled.

     This uncovered the fact that the Debian-style init scripts were not
     working anyway.  The scripts have been fixed and the strace and
     strerr utilities now default to enabled.

     The strbcflag flag was never being cleared, causing infinite
     looping of the scheduler once the maximum number of buffers was

     'ldl' was using an incorrect MKDEV command, but when the Stream
     head attempted to redirect the open to the new (mangled) major
     device number, it properly returned ENXIO, but did not release a
     reference to the module.  Need to check code paths for this to see
     where the reference needed to be released.

     _*known bug*_

'strxns 001. 2007-04-02T11:52:59+0000'

     'ldl' was not demand loading for 2.6 kernels due to missing
     MODULE_ALIAS declarations.  Also, 'ldl' had an incorrect SVR 3
     style 'MKDEV(MAJOR(*devp), i)' construct in it that was using Linux
     utilities instead of Linux Fast-STREAMS utilities, causing the
     Stream head to attempt to redirect the major device.
     Unfortunalely, this was failing.  Changed to the correct SVR 4
     style 'makedevice(getmajor(*devp), i)'.  (There must still be a bad
     major redirection path in the Stream head.)

'streams 008. 2007-03-31T05:33:29-0600'

     When loosening SMP locking, found a bug in the QWANTR handling in
     'getq(9)' (*note (*manpages*)getq(9)::) and back-enabling in
     'flushq(9)' (*note (*manpages*)flushq(9)::) and 'flushband(9)'
     (*note (*manpages*)flushband(9)::).  Both of these were generating
     false back-enables.  The 'getq(9)' (*note (*manpages*)getq(9)::)
     was generating a _lot_ of false back-enables.  Whenever 'getq(9)'
     (*note (*manpages*)getq(9)::) found an empty queue it was not only
     setting QWANTR, but it was back-enabling the queue.  The result is
     that if service procedures are used exclusively (that is,
     'qi_put(9)' always does a 'putq(9)' (*note (*manpages*)putq(9)::)),
     'getq(9)' (*note (*manpages*)getq(9)::) would generate a false
     back-enable for each message.  Also, the enabled queue would
     generate another false back-enable.  Significant performance gains
     should be noticed.

     It appears that V401PE cards were almost loading (configuring,
     mapping, downloading firmware) but were failing to configure at the
     final stage of the process (matching device id to board type).  The
     device id for the 2155 is supposed to be b4 regardless of E1 or T1,
     but I just guess that the card is reporting 34 instead of b4 for E1
     (it might be the firmware setting or unsetting the high bit as was
     done for the other devices).  I changed the sl_x400p.c driver to
     print error messages when loading if such mismatches occur and set
     the device ids to accept 0x3X as an E1 2155 device and 0bX as a
     T1/J1 2155 device (even though they are all the same).

     As it turns out, the V401PE cards have a DS2156 chip instead of a
     DS2155 chip.  The only difference is the lack of Tx fixed gain
     control (register 0x7d) and the DS2156 supports a UTOPIA II bus
     that is not used on the V401PE. I changed the driver to recognize
     the DS2156 and skip register 0x7d when it exists.  The DS2156 chip
     will work for both V401T (D33D) and V401E (D44D) cards.

     When the number of test packets is set to 300, we are crashing on

     test packets, TEST_PACKETS has been reduced from 300 to 30 to avoid
     the crash.  Again, packet tests at IP level should reveal this
     problem.

     Note that there does not seem to be a problem with similar TPI

     I notice that when the message size in this test is larger than the

     So, it looks like we are not handling zero window probes very well
     at all.  For now I have just reduced the message size as this is
     for interface testing not packet testing.  Packet tests at IP level

6.6 Schedule
============

Current Plan
------------

The 'OpenSS7' package is a mature collection of all of the OpenSS7
STREAMS and protocol modules that builds all components on a wide range
of supported Linux distributions and kernels.  The 'OpenSS7' package is
a builds and validates all components against a given distribution.

Therefore, the current plan for packaging is largely a maintenance plan.
The OpenSS7 Project (http://www.openss7.org/) intends to release
regularly new versions of the package that build and validate against
upcoming releases of the supported Linux Distributions available from
major distributors and upcoming releases of the Linux kernel, both
mainline and as patched by major distributions.  This release schedule
is approximately every 3 to 6 months.  More recent corrections and
support for new distributions and kernels can be obtained by sponsoring
the OpenSS7 Project (http://www.openss7.org/) and obtaining access to
the live CVS repository (also available as a git repository).

Two significant plans for the package include providing cross-compiling
support for more cross-platform development distributions, such as the
Denx ELDK. Also, support for real-time distributions such as Montavista
Linux and RT releases of SuSE and RedHat are within the scope of the
development plan.

No additional components are currently planned although development
within the existing components are planned.  See the section for the
component below, for a current development plan for a specific
component.

STREAMS Current Plan
....................

There are not many things left to be done on the production Linux
Fast-STREAMS component.  As of the streams-0.9.3 release, performance
modifications are complete.  The component now exhibits performance on
STREAMS-based pipes and TPI drivers that is significantly (factor of 2
or more) superior to that experienced by legacy Linux facilities.

Therefore, the current plan for Linux Fast-STREAMS is largely a
maintenance plan.  Items on the todo list, below, will be picked up as
time permits.  The OpenSS7 Project intends to release regularly new
versions of Linux Fast-STREAMS that build and validate against upcoming
releases of the supported Linux Distributions available from major
distributors and upcoming releases of the Linux kernel, both mainline
and as patched by major distributors.  This release schedule is
approximately every 3 to 6 months.  More recent corrections and support
for new distributions and kernels can be obtained by sponsoring the
OpenSS7 Project and obtaining access to the live CVS repository (also
available as a git repository).

One development activity in the works for Linux Fast-STREAMS is to
provide integral support for more embedded cross-platform development
systems such as the Denx ELDK, as well a existing and emerging RT
kernels such as Montavista and the upcoming SuSE and RedHat RT kernels.
This is a significant undertaking and will only be embarked upon when
the OpenSS7 Project is given free access to these RT kernels and
distributions.

COMPAT Current Plan
...................

There are not many things left to be done on the production OpenSS7
STREAMS Compatibility Modules component.  The current plan for the
component is largely a maintenance plan including support for current
distributions and kernels.

There are currently a large array of Solaris DDI compatibility functions
that are not implemented; however, there have not been many requests for
this capability.  Perhaps the advent of OpenSolaris has forstalled
porting of many drivers to Linux, but, regardless of the cause, there is
just not a demand.  If there are any functions that you need the OpenSS7
Project to support that are not currently supported in one of the
compatibility modules, please request support for them on the
openss7-develop mailing list.

BCM Current Plan
................

The OpenSS7 Project has made several stabs at making this component
available and providing it in a production grade form.  All attempts are
currently incomplete.  All in all there does not appear to be sufficient
interest in this capability to actually fund the work.  Therefore, this
component will remain incomplete until some entity can justify funding
the remainder of the development.  The OpenSS7 Project remains committed
to the open source model and providing this support runs somewhat
against that.  However, if your organization has a pressing need for
this capability and can offer funding for its completion, please contact
the project on the openss7 mailing list.

TTY Current Plan
................

This component is still incomplete.  It is missing a fully functional
ldterm module.  Also, performance testing of STREAMS-based pipes from
the Linux Fast-STREAMS indicates that STREAMS-based pseudo-terminals
could exhibit far superior performance to that exhibited by the legacy
Linux (SVR 3 style) pseduo-terminals.  To accomplish this requires fully
implementing ldterm, creating validation test suites, and peformance
analysis and comparison with legacy Linux mechanisms.

This component is not currently a priority for the OpenSS7 Project,
which is focussed on more telecom-specific protocol stacks and
capabilities.  Nevertheless, if completion of this component is
important in your industry and your organization is able to fund further
development or contribute the missing items, contact us on the
openss7-develop mailing list.  Until funding or a mandate surfaces, this
component will likely continue as a proof-of-concept only.  It will be
maintained in a compilable and installable state (that is, it will be
updated for current Linux distributions and kernels) on the same basis
as other components in the OpenSS7 package.

CHAN Current Plan
.................

This component, which contains hard-switch or MG capabilities is not
currently planned.  Of priority is the production deployment of
soft-switch or MGC and Signalling Gateway components from the 'SIGTRAN',
'SS7' and 'VOIP' components.  This component will only receive
maintenance releases until those priorities have been sufficiently met
(over the course of Summer 2009).

XNS Current Plan
................

This component is mature and complete and in production release.  The
current plan is to provide only maintenance releases supporting more
recent Linux distributions, kernels and tool chains as they evolve.
Expect public maintenance releases on a 3 to 6 month cycle.

XNET Current Plan
.................

This component is mature and complete and in production release.  The
current plan is to provide only maintenance releases supporting more
recent Linux distributions, kernels and tool chains as they evolve.
Expect public maintenance releases on a 3 to 6 month cycle.

NSL Current Plan
................

Current plans are to just maintain this component for recent
distributions, kernels and tool chains.  Although at some point the
relation of this component to TI-RPC 2.8 needs to be worked out, when
that will happen is not currently on a schedule.  I do not really know
how much of a requirement there is for ONC RPC running over other
transports such as ISO transports and SCTP transports, although it would
surely be interesting to run NFS4 over SCTP.

This component is not currently a priority for the OpenSS7 Project,
which is focussed on more telecom-specific protocol stacks and
capabilities.  Nevertheless, if completion of this component is
important in your industry and your organization is able to fund further
development or contribute the missing items, contact us on the
openss7-develop mailing list.  Until funding or a mandate surfaces, this
component will likely continue as a proof-of-concept only.  It will be
maintained in a compilable and installable component (that is, it will
be updated for current Linux distributions and kernels) on the same
basis as other components in the OpenSS7 package.

SOCK Current Plan
.................

This component is still incomplete.  It is missing a fully functional
Stream head socket library, module or driver implementation.  Also,
performance testing of STREAMS INET drivers indicates that STREAMS-based
networking components could exhibit far superior performance to that
exhibited by legacy Linux sockets.  To accomplish this requires fully
implementing 'socklib(3)' (*note (*manpages*)socklib(3)::), 'sockmod(4)'
(*note (*manpages*)sockmod(4)::) module or 'socksys(4)' (*note
(*manpages*)socksys(4)::) driver, creating validation test suites, and
performance analysis and comparison with legacy Linux mechanisms.

This component is not currently a priority for the OpenSS7 project,
which is focussed on more telecom-specific protocol stacks and
capabilities.  Nevertheless, if completion of this component is
important to your industry and your organization is able to fund further
development or contribute the missing items, contact us on the
openss7-develop maling list.  Until funding or a mandate surfaces, this
component will likely continue as a proof-of-concept only.  It will be
maintained ina compilable and installable component (that is, it will be
updated for current Linux distributions and kernels) on the same basis
as other components in the OpenSS7 package.

INET Current Plan
.................

This component is mature and complete and in production release.  The
current plan is to provide only maintenance releases supporting more
recent Linux distributions and kernels as they evolve.  Expect public
maintenance releases on a 3 to 6 month cycle.

SCTP Current Plan
.................

This component is mature and complete and in production release.  The
current plan is to provide only maintenance releases supporting more
recent Linux distributions, kernels and tool chains as they evolve.
Expect public maintenance releases on a 3 to 6 month cycle.

X25 Current Plan
................

This component was initially started to provide managment interfaces to
platforms using the OpenSS7 protocol stacks (CMIP and CMOT interfaces)
using SS7 GDMO and other GDMO. It was considered pulling some of the old
'isode' package into this component to provide some GDMO facilities.

Since then, it was discovered that these ISO protocols are still very
important to a number of industries on Linux and Linux Fast-STREAMS.
These industries are the Aviation and Financial industries.  Closer to
the heard of telecommunications is the applications of aircraft to
ground communications for the Aviation industry.

While the OpenSS7 Project's focus over the Summer of 2009 is going to be
soft-switch enabling protocols, that may change if the Aviation industry
steps up to this component with some funding to complete the work or by
contributing changes, improvements or development to this component.
Otherwise, expect this component to receive only maintenance releases
over the next 8 months or so.

ISDN Current Plan
.................

This component is lower down on the priority list.  Current focus is on
pushing through the 'SIGTRAN', 'SS7' and 'VOIP' components instead.
This components sits at about the same status as the 'CHAN' component.
there exists modules and drivers in this component that have not yet
been publicly released and are only available to sponsors of the OpenSS7
Project on the CVS archive.  When the project gets back to this
component (sometime 2H2009), the plan will be to move the private
modules and drivers into the public release, place conformance
validation test cases around them and release this component as
production grade.

SS7 Current Plan
................

The current plan includes the public production release of SCCP, ISUP
and TCAP components.  MTP3 has not yet been publicly released and is not
currently scheduled.  (Implementing the AS-side of M3UA is taking
precedence.)  The first public production releases of SCCP, ISUP and
TCAP are planned for the end of July 2009.  This will be followed by lab
and limitied field trial testing with a lead customer in August and
production deployment in the lead customer's network in 1Q2009.  Expect
that over the next 8 months releases of this component will include
major new development and validation testing as well as including SCCP,
ISUP and TCAP components that have nor heretofore been publicly
released.

SIGTRAN Current Plan
....................

The current plan of the next several months (over the summer of 2009) is
to actively move this component forward.  This consists of the
following:

   * Move SIGTRAN modules and drivers that have not yet been publicly
     released into the public release.

   * Write test cases for complete AS-side implementations of all of the
     UAs (including ISUA and TUA).

   * Perform production testing of the UAs against Tekelec Eagle and
     Cisco ITP equipment.

   * Rigorous lab and limited field testing of AS-side components.

   * Production deployment in customer's network for 1Q2009.

Note that M2PA is complete.  Aside from that, the order of testing and
implementation will be M3UA followed by M2UA or SUA and then TUA, IUA
(including V5UA and GR303UA) and ISUA.

Production public releases of the AS side of M3UA can be expected by the
end of July 2009.

VOIP Current Plan
.................

The current plan of the next several months (over the summer of 2009) is
to actively move this component forward.  This consists of the
following:

   * Implementation and testing of MGCP (MGC-side) using the MGI and TCP
     transport from the 'INET' component.

   * Implementation and testing of MEGACO/H.248 (MGC-side, binary
     format) using the MGI and SCTP transport from the 'SCTP' component.

   * Implementation of SIP-T and SIP call control using the CCI and TCP
     transport from the 'INET' component and later SCTP transport from
     the 'SCTP' component.

   * Perform production testing of MEGACO/H.248 and MGCP against the
     Veraz iGATE, the Cisco 5400 and the Sonus Media Gateways.

   * Rigorous lab and limited field testing of the MGC-side components.

   * Production deployment in customer's network for 1Q2009.

The order of testing will be MEGACO/H.248 and then SIP-T and SIP
followed by MGCP. Production public releases of the MGC side of
MEGACO/H.248 and SIP-T acan be expected by the end of July 2009.

Things to Do
------------

   - Packaging.

     Get master build package working better.  Currently the master
     build package does not build a master tarball or RPM distribution,
     which would be nice, only individual RPMs for subpackages.

   - Cross-testing framework.

     We have nice autotest test suites that are fine for native builds,
     but for cross-compile builds, it would also be nice to cross-test.
     We can accomplish this nicely within the autoconf framework using
     DejaGNU. DejaGNU configured under the STREAMS, but we need a more
     general autoconf .m4 fragement check for the existence of DejaGNU,
     and automake and DejaGNU expect wrappers for the existing test
     programs (and integration into the make check-DEJAGNU target).
     Then we could cross-build the package and then execute the test
     scripts on the result on a remote board using DEJAGNU.

   - Distributed testing framework.

     Because these are mostly communications protocols implemented using
     STREAMS, it is important to be able to do consistent distributed
     testing and validation of the protocol implementations.  We can
     perform much validation using Ferry-Clip approaches (linking or
     pushing STREAMS-based pipes beneath drivers or modules), however,
     acceptance and performance testing would benefit from a distributed
     framework.  Perhaps the most direct yet general approach to this is
     TETware from OpenGroup and is used for POSIX (and XNS 5.2, by the
     way) test suites from OpenGroup.  Although netperf incorporates its
     own client-server subsystem, TETware provides these mechanisms
     separately.  TETware also provides mechanisms for test case
     synchronization points between distributed systems that makes
     distributed conformance test cases quite possible.  Note that
     TETware does not really require any external tools but does require
     network access and installation on the target systems (unlike
     DejaGNU that can execute test cases over a serial port if
     necessary).

   - Dynamic configuration.

     Automake files (Makefile.am) are too static.  The strbcm package
     needs the list of sources and objects to be rather dynamic.  It
     would be nice to convert all packages to the same approach.  We
     could perhaps use strconf-sh to generate Makefile.in fragments at
     configuration time and then include them in a far more general main
     Makefile.am file.

   - Merge sub-packages.

     I really want to put all these packages back together, it is too
     time consuming maintaining the various administrative files for
     each of seven or so packages.

          * streams-0.7a.5
          * strcompat-0.9.2.4
          * strutil-0.9.2.4
          * strxns-0.9.2.4
          * strxnet-0.9.2.9
          * strinet-0.9.2.4
          * strsctp-0.9.2.6
          * netperf-2.3.2

     The result will be just a streams-0.9.4 release.  The only two
     (STREAMS) packages left will be strbcm and strss7.

STREAMS Things to Do
....................

   - Support for RT kernels.  This is a little more than just having the
     STREAMS scheduler run as a non-RT process kernel thread, which it
     does now, and which is trivial.  (The existing package should
     compile and run against these kernels with minor modification in
     this event.)

     More to the point is working the light-weight STREAMS scheduler and
     service procedures into a prioritized scheme where service
     procedures run as real-time, yet pre-emptable tasks.  In contrast
     to the current scheme, it is likely that the approach would be to
     either spawn multiple kernel threads for the STREAMS scheduler at
     different priorities, or to alter the priority of the STREAMS
     scheduler in response to the scheduling of specific queues at
     specific priorities.  A design is not really possible until the
     intricacies of upcoming RT kernels are discovered.

     _TODO:_
          Provide support for RT kernels.

   - Per cpu data:- I am still using the older approach of using cache
     line aligned arrays for per-cpu data.  This, of course, does not
     fully utilize NUMA architectures.  For NUMA architectures we need
     to use the per-cpu utilities provided by the 2.6 and 3.x kernel.  I
     haven't touched converting this yet.

     Also, there are several NUMA supporting STREAMS utility functions
     (allocb_node, etc.)  that need to be supported yet.

     _TODO:_
          Convert cacheline aligned arrays to NUMA per-cpu data on 2.6
          and 3.x kernels.  Complete NUMA supporting STREAMS facilities.

   - Provide support for assigning a processor affinity for queue pairs.
     The current STREAMS scheduler will schedule a queue enabled as a
     result of, for example, a put() on the same processor that
     performed the action that caused the enable.  This has been
     adequate for event driven systems.  However, for pipelined hard
     real-time, better processor instruction cache efficiency and
     concurrency might be gained by assigning portions of the pipeline
     to different processors, so that, for example, when a put is
     performed to a queue, that the queue will become enabled against
     the process with which it has an affinity rather than the enabling
     processor.  This might permit assigning a different processor
     affinity to each queue-pair in a pipeline to exploit concurrency in
     the pipeline.

     _TODO:_
          Add an optional processor affinity to the STREAMS scheduler.

   - Split 'include/sys/streams/stropts.h' by architecture.  There is
     conflicting numbering on the standard STREAMS input-output
     controls:

     'I_SWROPT(7)'    'I_GWROPT(7)'    'I_LIST(7)'
     (*note           (*note           (*note
     (*manpages*)I_SWROPT(7)::)(*manpages*)I_GWROPT(7)::)(*manpages*)I_LIST(7)::)
     'I_FLUSHBAND(7)' 'I_CKBAND(7)'    'I_GETBAND(7)'
     (*note           (*note           (*note
     (*manpages*)I_FLUSHBAND(7)::)(*manpages*)I_CKBAND(7)::)(*manpages*)I_GETBAND(7)::)
     'I_ATMARK(7)'    'I_SETCLTIME(7)' 'I_GETCLTIME(7)'
     (*note           (*note           (*note
     (*manpages*)I_ATMARK(7)::)(*manpages*)I_SETCLTIME(7)::)(*manpages*)I_GETCLTIME(7)::)
     'I_CANPUT(7)'
     (*note
     (*manpages*)I_CANPUT(7)::)

     'System V Release 4' UNIX(R) vendors use one set and 'OSF' UNIX(R)
     vendors use another.  Namely 'HP-UX', 'OSF/1.2', 'AIX', 'Mac
     OpenTransport' use OSF numbering, whereas 'IRIX', 'Solaris',
     'UnixWare' and others use SVR4 numbering.  So, for HPPA, Alpha,
     PowerPC, we should use the OSF numbering.

     I know that it is a fall-back to the SVR4 way of separating
     architectural differences by UNIX vendor (if it is HPPA, it must be
     sold by HP and it must be HP-UX running on it, for example), but
     even the Linux kernel is victim to this (many ioctls and some errno
     numbering is split this way).  It is completely entrenched in GNU
     autoconf's config.guess.

     _TODO:_
          Split 'include/sys/streams/stropts.h' by processor
          architecture.

   - A similar numbering mismatch occurs for many of the message block
     types.

     _TODO:_
          Split 'include/sys/streams/streams.h' by processor
          architecture.

   - Implement 'I_EGETSIG(7)' (*note (*manpages*)I_EGETSIG(7)::) and
     'I_ESETSIG(7)' (*note (*manpages*)I_ESETSIG(7)::).  These are
     'Solaris' enhanced version of the 'I_GETSIG(7)' (*note
     (*manpages*)I_GETSIG(7)::) and 'I_SETSIG(7)' (*note
     (*manpages*)I_SETSIG(7)::) STREAMS input-output controls.  The
     difficulty with their implementation is that the entire signal
     handling setup inside the Stream head code is geared toward the
     calling process and needs to be adjusted to be general enough for
     any process or process group.  Until then, 'Linux' file
     asynchronous I/O is supported.

     _PARTLY DONE:_
          Wrote the manual pages and added them to the build.  Placed
          function skeletons that return '[EOPNOTSUPP]' for these
          functions in the Stream head.
     _TODO:_
          Implement 'I_EGETSIG(7)' and 'I_ESETSIG(7)'.

   - Socket buffer handling:

       1. Rather than write offset and padding, why not provide a flag
          (e.g.  SO_SKBUFF) to indicate to the stream head to allocate
          an sk_buff with the message block and share buffers between
          mblk and sk_buff, then, the sk_buff can be used without
          allocation in the bottom half.  esballoc() and alloc_skbuff()
          can be used to set up the message block.  dup() could be made
          aware of the hidden sk_buff and increment the shared sk_buff
          count as well.  Also, msgpullup() and pullupmsg() could be
          made aware of message blocks containing sk_buffs and have them
          do the appropriate thing.

       2. The other thing that is needed is some way to tell the other
          end of a loopback connection that the sk_buff it has received
          already has an mblk attached to it as above.  Then the message
          block could be simply passed upstream and one would not need
          to be esballoc'ed for it.

       3. Another thing is to provide the ability to partial checksum
          and copy data from user into these sk_buffs, but setting an
          SO_CSUM flag along with the SO_SKBUFF flag to indicate the
          type of checksum to perform.

     The combination of the above three items should provide some
     serious performance gains for Linux networking based stream heads.

     _PARTIALLY DONE:_
          Item (1) is done and complete.  The 2nd generation UDP and RAW
          drivers are already using it.  Item (2) and (3) remain.

   - Had another look at specfs, devfs and udev.  It looks like we can
     create minor device nodes within /dev (not just /dev/streams) using
     devfs or udev.  Again, this doesn't do everything that specfs does.
     specfs will demand load when an attempt is made to open a
     non-existent character device.  Nevertheless, we can describe a
     "streams" class for udev and when a module registers a minor device
     node, we can have udev create that device node and provide
     permissions by adding our files to the /etc/udev/rules.d and
     /etc/udev/permissions.d directories.

     Therefore, on a udev system, we should make strconf-sh create the
     necessary rules.d and permissions.d file entries.  register_strnod
     will be modified to create a udev instance within the stream class
     matching the rules.d and permissions.d entry when creating a minor
     device node within the specfs.

     On a devfs system, register_strdev and register_strnod should
     perform devfs calls instead of calling register_chrdev.  That way
     minor device nodes will automatically appear at least once the
     module is loaded.

     _TODO:_
          rationalize specfs to devfs and udev

   - Have the STREAMS subsystem register a panic notifier on 2.6 and 3.x
     kernels to be able to recover from panics caused by misbehaving
     STREAMS modules or drivers.

     _TODO:_
          Register panic notifier.

   - Kernel objects are another thing.  For 2.6 or 3.x kernels, we need
     to hold our data structures in the kobject manner so that the /sys
     file system is usable.  This requires another adaptation layer
     because 2.4 kernels do this in a completely different way.  Much of
     our /proc file system stuff needs to move into /sys for 2.6 or 3.x
     kernels but stay the same for 2.4 kernels.

     The /sys file system does not really do much for STREAMS. The
     /dev/streams specfs file system does more for us.

     _SKIPPED._

COMPAT Things to Do
...................

   - Implement the AIX strtune() command.

     _*todo*_

   - I would really really like a set of rmallocmap(), rmalloc(),
     rmalloc_wait(), rmfree(), rmfreemap() functions so that drivers
     could stop using the kmem_cache functions but could acheive similar
     effect.

     _*todo*_

   - Work in MUTEX_ALLOC(), MUTEX_DESTROY(), MUTEX_LOCK(), MUTEX_MINE(),
     MUTEX_OWNED(), MUTEX_TRYLOCK(), MUTEX_UNLOCK() from IRIX into
     irixcompat.c.

     _*todo*_

   - Work in streams_interrupt() and STREAMS_TIMEOUT() from IRIX into
     irixcompat.c.

     _*todo*_

   - Hey, here's an idea for testing Solaris compatibility: take an
     OpenSolaris source file for a STREAMS driver and compile and test
     it under Linux with no (or minimal) source code modifications!

     _*todo*_

   - Write test programs and test suites.  There are really not any test
     programs or test suites available for the OpenSS7 STREAMS
     Compatibility Modules package as of strcompat-0.9.2.2.

     _*todo*_

   - Not all compatibility functionality is implemented.  There are a
     large number of Sun DDI functions applicable to STREAMS that have
     not been fully implemented.  Also, the Sun configuration management
     mechanism is not yet fully implemented and neither is that for AIX.
     Also, there is a large group of SVR 4.2 compatible functions that
     are not directly STREAMS related but are part of the DDI/DKI and
     should be implemented to provide abstraction from Linux internals
     as well as the ability to link binary modules.

     _*moved*_
          (Note that the ability to link binary modules has been moved
          to is own 'strbcm' package.)

   - Linking of binary modules is not yet supported.  This is the place
     (strcompat) where binary modules should be permitted to be loaded
     against Linux Fast-STREAMS, because the binary compatibility
     interface modules are defined here.  There is the beginnings of an
     strconf script output to generate a C-language wrapper file that
     will link with a binary object file to generate a loadable module
     that could load under Linux Fast-STREAMS.

     _*moved*_
          (Note that the ability to link binary modules has been moved
          to is own 'strbcm' package.)

   - Documentation.  The documentation is trailing a bit.  I have
     thousands of manual pages written, however, some are sparse or
     incomplete.  Also, the manual and the STREAMS Porting Guide needs a
     bunch of work.

     _*todo*_
          Did a bunch of work on the manual, however, there is still a
          lot of work on a STREAMS Porting Guide to be done.

BCM Things to Do
................

   - Testing.  This package is completely untested.  One way to test
     compatibility is to take a set of frozen binary modules and drivers
     from the release and place them in a test directory.

   - The strbcm package is currently incomplete.  The purpose of the
     package was to move STREAMS binary compatibility module
     capabilities outside of the STREAMS release package.  As Linux
     Fast-STREAMS has become production grade in terms of both
     performance and conformance, it is no longer necessary to keep
     these packages separate and they can be combined once again (or
     still) with Linux Fast-STREAMS.

     This package; however, might has some use still outside of Linux
     Fast-STREAMS if only because it provides a separable way of
     incorporating 3rd party binary modules.

TTY Things to Do
................

   - Testing.  This package is completely untested.

     _*todo*_

   - Create a library 'libtty(3)' (*note (*manpages*)libtty(3)::) to
     hold the library functions for use with this package:

          'openpt(3)' (*note
          (*manpages*)openpt(3)::)
          'grantpt(3)' (*note
          (*manpages*)grantpt(3)::)
          'ptsname(3)' (*note
          (*manpages*)ptsname(3)::)
          'unlockpt(3)' (*note
          (*manpages*)unlockpt(3)::)

     _*todo*_

   - Create an 'ldterm(4)' (*note (*manpages*)ldterm(4)::) 'Line
     Discipline for Terminals' STREAMS module.  This item remains to be
     done.  Al that is in place right now is a skeleton module.

     _*todo*_

The 'openss7' package is currently incomplete.

The purpose of the package was to provide STREAMS terminal capabilities
for 'Linux Fast-STREAMS'. The package will only build and install with
'Linux Fast-STREAMS'

If someone is interested in this package, a contribution of a working
'ldterm(4)' (*note (*manpages*)ldterm(4)::) module would be good.  Also,
testing could be performed.

CHAN Things to Do
.................

   - Testing.  This package is completely untested.

     This remains to be done.

   - Actually implement all of the package.

   - Copy all of the channel drivers, multiplexers and switching drivers
     as well as media gateway drivers from the strss7 package and place
     it here.

     Note that this package should load before the strxns package
     because it provides channels that can be used for hdlc links and
     data links and the strxns package provides the CDI and DLPI
     interfaces.  It is possible that the CDI interface should be moved
     here.

XNS Things to Do
................

   - I want to write a NetFilter pseudo-device driver that will install
     and control netfilter hooks for performance testing.  It will do
     things like packet drops, checksum errors, packet duplication,
     packet delay, and combinations, for a specified range of addresses
     and/or protocols.  Also a set of user-space utilities (C language
     programs) to permit the control of the filters.  The purpose is to
     be able to do a wide range of performance testing on simulated
     networks that are simply loop back devices.  This would permit
     performance test programs (such as netperf) to be used for testing
     special network conditions on SCTP (for example), and will also
     allow for comparison tests.

   * The strxns package contains several GPL'd modules and drivers
     originally included in the STREAMS releases that were removed to
     this package so that they could be used with Linux Fast-STREAMS.

   - Test.  Almost none of the modules or drivers in this package have
     been tested thoroughly against Linux Fast-STREAMS. One of the
     primary reasons for this is that The OpenSS7 Project does not
     really use any of these modules or drivers.

   - This might be a useful place to drop all of the DLPI drivers from
     the strss7 package, particularly those for X.25, Frame Relay, and
     ISDN LAPD and LAPB.

XNET Things to Do
.................

   * The texinfo manual, 'libxnet.texi', is incomplete.  For the time
     being, the manual pages, starting with 'libxnet(3)' (*note
     (*manpages*)libxnet(3)::), are the definitive documentation.  It
     would be nice to also provide these library manual pages as a
     printable manual, however, the project has not yet found the time
     to complete this manual.

     _*todo*_

   * There is an XTITRACE option the was associated wtih the XTI library
     that provided the abilty to record trace information to a temporary
     file and then display or print it with an xtitrace user program.
     This capability is not yet implemented in this XTI library and
     remains to be done.

     _*todo*_

   * Need to remove the following functions: 't_sndopt(3)' (*note
     (*manpages*)t_sndopt(3)::), 't_sndvopt(3)' (*note
     (*manpages*)t_sndvopt(3)::), 't_rcvopt(3)' (*note
     (*manpages*)t_rcvopt(3)::) and 't_rcvvopt(3)' (*note
     (*manpages*)t_rcvvopt(3)::); as they are non-standard and
     non-portable.  Instead use the following functions: 't_sndudata(3)'
     (*note (*manpages*)t_sndudata(3)::), 't_sndvudata(3)' (*note
     (*manpages*)t_sndvudata(3)::), 't_rcvudata(3)' (*note
     (*manpages*)t_rcvudata(3)::) and 't_rcvvudata(3)' (*note
     (*manpages*)t_rcvvudata(3)::); because they have precisely the same
     argument templates as the other.  These functions are described in
     the OpenGroup documentation as inapplicable to connection-oriented
     transports, however, we could relieve that restriction for SCTP.
     The characteristics to check is if T_CLTS, okay, T_COTS or
     T_COTS_ORD, only okay if the tsdu_size is not T_INVALID (as it is
     for TCP). (It would be okay to be T_INFINITE as it is for SCTP.)

     _*todo*_

     They may have already been removed.  Verify this.  They certainly
     have to be implemented this way yet.

   * The XTI/TLI library is now largely in maintenance mode.  Not much
     special development is planned.

   - Full ATM Support.  This is an item where the XTI implementation is
     lacking.  When we provide full TPI ATM support under the strss7
     package, then this item will be investigated.

     _*todo*_

NSL Things to Do
................

   * Fedora 7 has a libtirpc library that uses the /etc/netconfig files.
     To avoid conflicts, the installation scripts now avoid overwriting
     this file.  An interesting thing is that the libtirpc
     implementation is taken from TI-RPC 2.3 when there is a TI-RPC 2.8
     available.  In generating an strrpc package, it should replace this
     broken libtirpc library with a TI-RPC 2.8 library supporting
     STREAMS using this strnsl package.

     _*todo*_

   * The package still needs to be internationalized.

     _*todo*_

   * This implementation of the Network Selection facility and
     Name-to-Address mapping allows direct use of TI-RPC for Linux.  The
     primary benefit of this is the ability to use TI-RPC code directly
     without significant and thus support upper level services such as
     NFS Version 4.  Another amazing possibility is to not only
     immediately run NFS Version 4, but also to run it over SCTP. A todo
     item is to take the TI-RPC 2.8 release and port it to Linux
     Fast-STREAMS. This might best be approached with a separate strrpc
     package, or addressed directly by this package.

     _*todo*_

   * The texinfo manual, 'libxnsl.texi', is incomplete.  For the time
     being, the manual pages, starting with 'libxnsl(3)' (*note
     (*manpages*)libxnsl(3)::), are the definitive documentation.  It
     would be nice to also provide these library manual pages as a
     printable manual, however, the project has not yet found the time
     to complete this manual.

     _*todo*_

   * This package is largely untested.  A conformance test suite and
     some test cases need to be written.

     _*todo*_

SOCK Things to Do
.................

   - Testing.  This package is completely untested.

     _*todo*_

   - Create a 'socksys(4)' (*note (*manpages*)socksys(4)::) 'Socket
     System' STREAMS driver.

     _*todo*_

   - It would be interesting to perform some 'Netperf' and 'Iperf'
     performance tests against STREAMS-based network drivers supporting
     'Transport Provider Interface (TPI)' and "Sockets" using this
     socket system.  Without 'sockmod(4)' and 'libsocket' it was only
     possible to use 'Netperf' for performance testing, and then only
     using the XTI tests.

     _*todo*_

   - Create the 'socket(3)' (*note (*manpages*)socket(3)::) 'libsocket'
     shared library.

     _*todo*_

   - Create a 'sockmod(4)' (*note (*manpages*)sockmod(4)::) 'Socket
     Module' STREAMS module.

     _*todo*_

   - Move already written code from the 'stacks' or 'strss7' directories
     into the 'src' directory.

     _*todo*_

The 'openss7' package is currently incomplete.

The purpose of the package was to move STREAMS socket capabilities
outside of the STREAMS release package.  As 'Linux Fast-STREAMS' has
already shown production grade in terms of both performance and
conformance, it is no longer necessary to keep these packages separate
and they can be combined once again (or still) with 'Linux
Fast-STREAMS'.

INET Things to Do
.................

   - Loop back devices (ticlts, ticots, ticotsord) are currently
     implemented in the 'inet(4)' driver using UNIX domain sockets and
     the XTI over sockets approach.  It should be straightforward to
     implement these loopback devices directly in STREAMS without
     involving sockets.  These second generation loopback drivers need
     to be written yet.

     _*todo*_

   - Implement pseudo-connection oriented modes in INET(4) driver as
     well as udp2(4) and rawip2(4) drivers.  Document use of
     pseudo-connection oriented modes for UDP and RAWIP.
     Pseudo-connection oriented modes permit a connectionless (T_CLTS)
     provider such as udp to provide the appearance of connection
     oriented service.  This makes conversion from the Sockets API to
     XTI API easier.

     Note that this is also very applicable to MTP (quasi-associated
     signalling such as ISUP) and SCCP protocol class 0 and 1 and TCAP.

     _*todo*_

   - It might be worth retrying the netperf(1) performance test on the
     second generation UDP driver with this pseudo-connection oriented
     mode in place.  You see, the netperf tests for UDP sockets performs
     a connect(3).

     _*todo*_

   - Implement pseudo-connectionless modes in INET(4) driver as well as
     sctp(4) drivers.  Document use of pseudo-connectionless modes for
     SCTP (not really applicable to TCP). Pseudo-connectionless modes
     permit a connection-oriented (T_COTS) provider such as sctp to
     provide the appearance of connectionless service.  This makes
     support for the SCTP one-to-many model easier.  Also, it provides a
     way (t_sndudata(3), t_sndvudata(3), t_rcvudata(3), t_rcvvudata(3))
     of passing options associated with the packet to the provider
     either in a T_OPTDATA or in a T_UNITDATA. This would make support
     of SCTP's many per-packet options more workable for XTI as well as
     providing a easier translation between the sockets API and XTI API
     for sctp.

     Note that this is also very applicable to SCCP protocol classes 2
     and 3 and BSSAP.

     _*todo*_

   - Convert inet driver to use os7 common functions.  In fact, it might
     be a better idea to convert the driver to use MPS common functions
     instead as we are now trying to move away from os7 common
     functions.

     _*todo*_

   - Connectionless testing using netperf competes well with
     connection-oriented sockets.  Need to still modify netperf to use
     (pseudo-)connection-oriented UDP for better comparison.

     _*todo*_

SCTP Things to Do
.................

   - The strsctp package is quite stable and mature as of
     strsctp-0.9.2.2 and most of the things that remain to be done are
     rigorous conformance and performance testing.

     _*todo*_

   - Move the tpiperf(4) module to the strxnet package and rename it
     tiperf(4).

     _*todo*_

   - Implement pseudo-connectionless modes in sctp(4) driver.  Document
     use of pseudo-connectionless modes for SCTP. Pseudo-connectionless
     modes permit a connection-oriented (T_COTS) provider such as
     sctp_t(4) to provide the appearance of connectionless service.
     This makes support for the SCTP one-to-many model easier.  Also, it
     provides a way (t_sndudata(3), t_sndvudata(3), t_rcvudata(3),
     t_rcvvudata(3)) of passing options associated with the packet to
     the provider either in a T_OPTDATA or in a T_UNITDATA. This would
     make support of SCTP's many per-packet options more workable for
     XTI as well as providing an easier translation between the sockets
     API and XTI API for sctp.

     Note that this is also very applicable to SCTP protocol classes 2
     and 3 and BSSAP.

     Perhaps the first proper step for this is to rewrite t_sndudata(3),
     t_sndvudate(3), t_rcvudata(3), and t_rcvvudata(3) handle
     T_OPTDATA_REQ(7) and T_OPTDATA_IND(7) primitives when in T_COTS
     mode.

     _*todo*_

   - Work recent SCTP I-G changes into the code.  Many of the I-G
     changes over the years have been implemented in the code, however,
     some of the more recent changes that made it into RFC 4460 have not
     yet been added.  This is an ongoing process.

     _*todo*_

   - Writing new IP-packet-level conformance test suites.

     _*todo*_

   - It would also be an idea to make the STREAMS SCTP Driver able to be
     pushed as a module over a STREAMS-based pipe end so that Ferry-Clip
     conformance testing could be performed.  In fact, Ferry-Clip
     testing might be better and more flexible than IP-packet-level
     testing because it is possible to closely control the timing of
     arriving packets on a STREAMS-based pipe.  In fact, this is such a
     good idea, I think that I will proceed along the Ferry-Clip lines
     for testing first and only perform the IP packet-level testing
     later.

     _*todo*_

ISDN Things to Do
.................

   - Testing.  This package is completely untested.

     This remains to be done.

   - Actually implement all of the package.

SS7 Things to Do
................

There is a great long list of these, but here is a crack at the first
ones:

   - Compile entire (private) package against Linux Fast-STREAMS.

   - Convert test programs into conformance test suites under GNU
     autotest.  This should be straight forward matter.

   - Start retesting SIGTRAN components against SCTP and Linux
     Fast-STREAMS starting with M2PA.

   - Start retesting SS7 Device Drivers under Linux Fast-STREAMS
     starting with X400P.

   - Start retesting SS7 Stack components (MTP2, MTP3, SCCP, ISUP, TCAP)
     under Linux Fast-STREAMS.

   - Package a public release.  It has been way too long since a public
     release of this package.  The package has almost a million lines of
     code in it, most of which the public has never seen!

   - Complete the SL-MUX driver and utility programs.

   - Complete the libslpcap library ('pcap(3)') for live capture of SS7
     link SDUs using 'ethereal(1)' or 'wireshark(1)'.

6.7 History
===========

For the latest developments with regard to history of changes, please
see the 'ChangeLog' file in the release package.

7 Installation
**************

     _Please note that the installation instructions have changed.
     Previously 'OpenSS7' releases consisted of a number of subpackages
     to a master package: this is no longer the case.  All 'OpenSS7'
     release software is now contained in a single package.  This change
     was necessary to reduce the maintenance burden cause by a growing
     number of subpackages.  The net benefit of this changes is that the
     resulting tarballs, RPMs and DEBs are far less error prone due to
     far fewer dependencies between RPMs and DEBs._

7.1 Repositories
================

The OpenSS7 package release can be accessed from the repositories of The
OpenSS7 Project (http://www.openss7.org/).  For 'rpm(8)' based systems,
the package is available in a 'yum(8)' repository based on 'repo-md' XML
and may also be accessed using 'up2date(8)', 'zypper(8)' or 'yast(8)'.
For 'yast(8)' based systems, the package is also available as a
'yast(8)' installation source.  For 'dpkg(1)' based systems, the package
is available in an 'apt(8)' repository.

By far the easiest (most repeatable and manageable) form for installing
and using the 'OpenSS7' packages is to install packages from the
'yum(8)', 'yast(8)' or 'apt(8)' repositories.  If your distribution does
not support 'yum(8)', 'zypper(8)', 'up2date(8)', 'yast(8)' or 'apt(8)',
then it is still possible to install the RPMs or DEBs from the
repositories using 'rpm(8)', 'dpkg(1)'; or by using 'wget(1)' and then
installing them from RPM or DEB using 'rpm(8)' or 'dpkg(1)' locally.

If binaries are not available for your distribution or specific kernel,
but your distribution supports 'rpm(8)' (*note (*manpages*)rpm(8)::) or
'dpkg(1)' (*note (*manpages*)dpkg(1)::), the next best method for
installing and using 'OpenSS7' packages is to download and rebuild the
source RPMs or DSCs from the repository.  This can also be performed
with 'yum(8)', 'zypper(8)', 'yast(8)', 'apt(8)'; or directly using
'wget(1)', 'rpm(8)' or 'dpkg(1)'.

If your architecture does not support 'rpm(8)' or 'dpkg(1)' at all, or
you have special needs (such as cross-compiling for embedded targets or
for development), the final resort method is to download, configure,
build and install from the tarball.

7.1.1 Repository Access
-----------------------

Repositories are located under <https://www.openss7.org/repo>.  The path
from there to the specific repository consists of the following
components:

PACKAGING
     For 'yum(8)' and 'yast(8)' repositories, this is always 'rpms'.
     For 'apt(1)' repositories, this is always 'debs'.  For 'tar(1)'
     repositories, this is 'tarballs'.
DISTRO
     The identifier of the distrbution.  Example, 'centos', 'debian'.
RELEASE
     The release of the distribution.  Example, '5.5', 'squeeze'.
ARCH
     The architecture of the release.  Example , 'x86_64', 'amd64'.

So, for example, the 'CentOS 5.5' distribution for 'x86_64' is located
under <https://www.openss7.org/repo/rpms/centos/5.5/x86_64/>; the
'Debian Squeeze' distribution for 'i386' is located under
<https://www.openss7.org/repo/debs/debian/squeeze/i386/>; the tarball
distribution is located under <https://www.openss7.org/repo/tarballs>.

Note that repository access is restricted.  You may download the 'repo'
packages without restriction, however, when installing the 'repo'
package you will be prompted for your registration username and
repository password.  The RPMs or DEBs that you will be allowed access
to will depend on your entitlement.

For the following distributions, follow the instructions in the sections
referenced:

7.1.2 Repositories for YUM
--------------------------

The 'yum(8)' repositories are based on 'repo-md' XML and are provided
for all 'RedHat'/'Fedora' architectures 'RHEL 4.8' and beyond, or 'FC 7'
and beyond.  This includes all current (supported) 'RHEL' systems.

7.1.2.1 Setting up YUM
......................

To install or upgrade from the 'OpenSS7' 'repo-md' repositories using
'yum(8)', you will need to install the 'openss7-repo' RPM on your
system, as follows:

     $> REPO="https://user@www.openss7.org/repo/rpms"
     $> REPONOARCH="$REPO/fedora/15/x86_64/RPMS/noarch"
     $> REPORPM="$REPONOARCH/openss7-repo.noarch.rpm"
     $> sudo rpm -Uhv $REPORPM
     $> Username: anonymous
     $> Password: *******

The example, above, assumes that the distribution is 'fedora' and the
distribution release is '15' and the required architecture is 'x86_64'.
Another example would be '$REPO/redhat/6.0/x86_64/RPMS/noarch', for
using 'yum(8)' with RHEL.

To obtain access to the repository at the level to which you are
entitled, you will have to respond to the 'Username:' query with the
user name with which you are registered with <https://www.openss7.org/>,
and to the 'Password:' query with your repository access password.(1)

You can test whether the 'yum(8)' repository is properly set up by
refreshing the repository and by listing the packages:

     $> sudo yum makecache openss7
     $> sudo yum search openss7
     $> sudo yum info openss7
     $> sudo yum info @openss7

Note that only the packages to which you are entitled will be listed.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note that your repository access password is separate and
distinct from your web access or mailing list password.

7.1.2.2 Using the YUM Repository
................................

Once the repository is set up, 'OpenSS7' includes a number of virtual
package and package group definitions that ease the installation and
removal of kernel modules, libraries and utilities.  Downloading,
configuring, building and installation for a single-kernel distribution
is as easy as (one of):

     $> sudo yum install openss7
     $> sudo yum install @openss7
     $> sudo yum groupinstall openss7

Removing the package is as easy as (one of):

     $> sudo yum remove openss7
     $> sudo yum remove @openss7
     $> sudo yum groupremove openss7

To install the development packages for developing STREAMS modules and
drivers, or applications that use the 'OpenSS7 Protocol Suites', install
the development packages using (one of):

     $> sudo yum install openss7-devel
     $> sudo yum install @openss7-devel
     $> sudo yum groupinstall openss7-devel

Of course, you are welcome to use a GUI based package manager, such as
'PackageKit(8)'.

7.1.2.3 YUM Kernel Updates
..........................

The 'OpenSS7' 'yum(8)' repository definitions support the automatic
updating of kernel modules when kernels are updated.  When the system is
updated, using 'yum update', openss7 packages that are available for an
updated kernel will be installed automatically.  'OpenSS7' kernel module
packages also support weak updates and when kernels are updated to
compatible kernels (e.g.  for security updates, or normally for any
update within an Enterprise distribution), kernel modules are
automatically applied against the updated kernel.

7.1.2.4 Setting up ZYPPER
.........................

To install or upgrade from the 'OpenSS7' 'repo-md' repositories using
'zypper(8)', you will need to install the 'openss7-repo' RPM on your
system, as follows:

     $> REPO="https://user@www.openss7.org/repo/rpms"
     $> REPONOARCH="$REPO/opensuse/11/x86_64/RPMS/noarch"
     $> REPORPM="$REPONOARCH/openss7-repo.noarch.rpm"
     $> sudo rpm -Uhv $REPORPM
     $> Username: anonymous
     $> Password: *******

The example assumes that the distribution is 'opensuse' and the
distribution release is '11' and the architecture requiresd is 'x86_64'.
Another example would be '$REPO/suse/11/x86_64/RPMS/noarch', for using
'zypper(8)' with SLES.

To obtain access to the repository at the level to which you are
entitled, you will have to respond to the 'Username:' query with the
user name with which you are registered with <https://www.openss7.org/>,
and to the 'Password:' query with your repository access password.(1)

'zypper(8)' does not do a very good job of importing GPG signatures.
When 'zypper' is reporting that there are no keys for the RPMs being
installed, the key can be imported directly into RPM as follows:

     $> sudo rpm --import https://www.openss7.org/pubkey.asc

You can test whether the 'zypper(8)' repository is properly set up by
refreshing the repository and by listing the packages:

     $> sudo zypper refresh openss7
     $> sudo zypper search -t package openss7
     $> sudo zypper info -t package openss7

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note that your repository access password is separate from you
web access or mailing list password.

7.1.2.5 Using the ZYPPER Repository
...................................

Once the repository is set up, 'OpenSS7' includes a number of virtual
package and package group (pattern) definitions that ease the
installation and removal of kernel modules, libraries and utilities.
Downloading, configuring, building and installation for a single-kernel
distribution is a easy as (one of):

     $> sudo zypper install -t pattern openss7
     $> sudo zypper install openss7

Removing the package is as easy as:(1)

     $> sudo zypper remove openss7

To install the development packages for developing 'STREAMS' modules and
drivers, or applications that use the 'OpenSS7 Protocol Suites', install
the development packages using (one of):

     $> sudo zypper install -t pattern openss7-devel
     $> sudo zypper install openss7-devel

Of course, you are welcome to use a GUI based package manager, such as
'yast2(8)'.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note that 'zypper(8)' does not yet support removal by pattern.

7.1.2.6 ZYPPER Kernel Updates
.............................

The 'OpenSS7' 'zypper(8)' repository definitions support the automatic
updating of kernel modules when kernels are updated.  When the system is
updated, using 'zypper update', 'OpenSS7' packages that are available
for an updated kernel will be installed automatically.  'OpenSS7' kernel
module packages also support weak updates and when kernels are updated
to compatible kernels (e.g.  for security updates, or normally for any
update within an Enterprise distribution), kernel modules are
automatically applied against the updated kernel.

7.1.2.7 General REPO-MD Repository
..................................

To avoid having to change the 'openss7.repo' file contents if they
should change on the archive, place the following into the
'openss7.repo' and place it into your '/etc/yum.repo.d/' directory:

     -| include=https://www.openss7.org/repo/rpms/centos/$releasever/$arch/repodata/openss7.repo

If you have difficulty downloading the 'openss7.repo' file, edit the
following information into the file and place it into the
'/etc/yum.repo.d/openss7.repo' file:

     -| [openss7]
     -| name = OpenSS7 Repository
     -| baseurl = https://www.openss7.org/repo/rpms/centos/$releasever/$arch
     -| gpgkey = https://www.openss7.org/repo/tarballs/OPENSS7-GPG-KEY
     -| repo_gpgcheck = 1
     -| gpgcheck = 1
     -| enabled = 1

Note that it is also possible to point to these repositories as an
additional installation source when installing CentOS, RedHat, Fedora,
or others.  You will have an additional STREAMS category from which to
choose installation packages.

The category that is provided is as follows:

'openss7-components' - OpenSS7 STREAMS and Protocol Suite Components.

The groups (patterns) that are provided in this category are as follows:
'openss7' -- OpenSS7 STREAMS and Protocol Suites. This group
     (pattern) installs packages required for the 'Linux Fast-STREAMS'
     and 'OpenSS7 Protocol Suites' run-time libraries, commands,
     utilities, init scripts and kernel modules.  Also included are
     section 1, 4, 5 and 8 manual pages for the commands, module and
     drivers, configuration file formats and administrative utilities.

     Install this group (pattern) if you need the 'Linux Fast-STREAMS'
     and 'OpenSS7 Protocol Suties' core run-time.

     The mandatory (required) packages in this group (pattern) are
     'openss7', 'openss7-base', 'openss7-lib' and 'openss7-kernel'.  The
     default (recommended) packages in this group (pattern) are
     'openss7-java'.  The optional (suggested) packages in this group
     (pattern) are 'openss7-devel', 'openss7-devel-kernel',
     'openss7-doc', 'openss7-javadoc' and 'openss7-source-kernel'.

'openss7-java' -- OpenSS7 STREAMS and Protocol Suite Java Components.
     This group (pattern) installs packages required for the 'Linux
     Fast-STREAMS' and 'OpenSS7 JAIN' Java components.

     The mandatory (required) packages in this group (pattern) are
     'openss7-java'.  The optional (suggested) packages in this group
     (pattern) are 'openss7-javadoc'.

'openss7-devel' -- OpenSS7 STREAMS and Protocol Suite Development.

     The mandatory (required) packages in this group (pattern) are
     'openss7-devel' and 'openss7-devel-kernel'.  The optional
     (suggested) packages in this group (pattern) are 'openss7-doc',
     'openss7-javadoc' and 'openss7-source-kernel'.

'openss7-doc' -- OpenSS7 STREAMS and Protocol Suite Documentation.

     The mandatory (required) packages in this group (pattern) are
     'openss7-doc' and 'openss7-javadoc'.

For assistance with specific RPMs, see *note Downloading the Binary
RPM::.

7.1.3 Repositories for YAST
---------------------------

For distributions that support 'YaST', such as 'SUSE Linux Enterprise
Server', and 'OpenSUSE', 'YaST' repositories are built coexistent with
'repo-md' repositories.  Setting up the installation source as a 'YaST'
installation source instead of 'repo-md' can provide the additional
features associated with 'YaST' install sources.

7.1.3.1 Setting up YAST
.......................

     $> REPODIR="https://www.openss7.org/repo/rpms/suse/11/x86_64"
     $> sudo zypper addrepo --type yast2 $REPODIR openss7

7.1.4 Repositories for URPMI
----------------------------

For distributions that support 'urmpi(8)', such as 'Mageia', 'Mandriva'
and 'MES', 'urpmi(8)' repositories are built.  Setting up the
installation source as a 'urpmi(8)' installation source instead of
'repo-md' can provide the additional features associated with 'urpmi(8)'
install sources.

7.1.4.1 Setting up URPMI
........................

To install or upgrade from the 'OpenSS7' 'urpmi' repositories using
'urpmi(8)', you will need to install the 'openss7-repo' RPM on your
system as follows:

     $> REPO="https://user@www.openss7.org/repo/repms"
     $> REPONOARCH="$REPO/mageia/1/x86_64/RPMS/noarch"
     $> REPORPM="$REPONOARCH/openss7-repo.noarch.rpm"
     $> sudo rpm -Uhv $REPORPM
     $> Username: anonymous
     $> Password: *******

The example, above, assumes that the distribution is 'mageia' and the
distribution release is '1' and the required architecture is 'x86_64'.
Another example would be '$REPO/mes/5.2/x86_64/RPMS/noarch', for using
'urpmi(8)' with MES (Mandriva Enterprise Server).

To obtain access to the respository at the level to which you are
entitled, you will have to respond to the 'Username:' query with the
user name with which you are registered with <http://www.openss7.org/>,
and to the 'Password:' query with your repository access password.(1)

You can test whether the 'urpmi(8)' repository is properly set up by
refreshing the repository with 'urpmi.update(8)' and by listing the
packages with 'urpmq(8)':

     $> sudo urpmi.update
     $> sudo urpmq -a | grep openss7
     $> sudo urpmq -ivl openss7

Note that only the packages to which you are entitled will be listed.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note that your repository access password is separate and
distinct from your web access or mailing list password.

7.1.4.2 Using the URPMI Repository
..................................

Once the repository is set up, 'OpenSS7' include a number of virtual
package and package group definitions that ease the installation and
removal of kernel modules, libriaries and utilities.  Downloading,
configuring, building and installation for a single-kernel distribution
is as easy as (one of):

     $> sudo urpmi openss7

Removing the package is as easy as (one of):

     $> sudo urpme openss7

To install the development packages for developing STREAMS modules and
drivers, or applications that use the 'OpenSS7 Protocol Suites', install
the development packages using (one of):

     $> sudo urpmi openss7-devel

Of course, you are welcome to use a GUI based package manager, such as
'rpmdrake(8)'.

7.1.4.3 URPMI Kernel Updates
............................

The 'OpenSS7' 'urpmi(8)' repository definitions support the automatic
updating of kernel modules when kernels are updated.  When the system is
updated, using 'urpmi', openss7 packages that are available for an
updated kernel will be installed automatically.  'OpenSS7' kernel module
packages also support weak updates and when kernels are updated to
compatible kernels (e.g.  for security updates, or normally for any
update within an Enterprise distribution), kernel modules are
automatically applied against the updated kernel.

7.1.5 Repositories for APT
--------------------------

For assistance with specific DEBs, see *note Downloading the Debian
DEB::.

7.1.5.1 Setting up APT
......................

To install or upgrade from the 'OpenSS7' 'apt' repositories using
'apt(8)', you will need to install the 'openss7-repo' DEB on your
system, as follows:

     $> REPO="https://user@www.openss7.org/repo/debs"
     $> REPONOARCH="$REPO/debian/squeeze/amd64"
     $> REPODEB="$REPONOARCH/openss7-repo_all.deb"
     $> wget $REPODEB
     $> dpkg -i -D010077 openss7-repo_all.deb
     $> Username: anonymous
     $> Password: ********

The example, above, assumes that the distribution is 'debian' and the
distribution release is 'squeeze' and the required architecture is
'amd64'.(1)  Another example would be '$REPO/ubuntu/10.04/amd64', for
using 'apt(8)' with Ubuntu.

To obtain access to the repository at the level to which you are
entitled, you will have to respond to the 'Username:' query with the
user name with which you are registered with <https://www.openss7.org/>,
and to the 'Password:' query with your repository access password.(2)

'apt(8)' does not do a very good job of importing GPG signatures.  When
'apt-get' is reporting that there are no keys for the DEBs being
installed, the key can be imported directly into APT as follows:

     $> wget https://www.openss7.org/pubkey.asc
     $> sudo apt-key add pubkey.asc

You can test whether the 'apt(8)' repository is properly set up by
refreshing the repository and by listing the packages.

     $> sudo apt-get update
     $> aptitude search openss7

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note that this is the '$(uname -m)' style architecture and not
the Debian sytle architecture.

   (2) Note that your repository access password is separate and
distinct from your web access password.

7.1.5.2 Using the APT Repository
................................

Once the repository is set up, 'OpenSS7' includes a number of virtual
packages and packages recommendations that ease the installation and
removal of kernel modules, libraries and utilities.  Downloading,
configuring, building and installation for a single-kernel distribution
is as easy as:(1)

     $> sudo aptitude install openss7

Removing the package is as easy as:

     $> sudo aptitude remove openss7
     $> sudo aptitude purge openss7

To install the development packages for developing 'STREAMS' modules and
drivers, or applications that use the 'OpenSS7 Protocol Suites', install
the development packages using:

     $> sudo aptitude install openss7-devel

Of course, you are welcome to use a GUI based package manager, such as
'synaptic(8)'.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note that using 'aptitude(8)' in this way relies upon
recommendations being treated as strong dependencies.  This is normally
the case for default 'apt(8)' configuration files (particularly when
'synaptic' is installed); however, it is not necessarily the case.  If
you are not getting recommended packages being automatically installed,
add '--with-recommends' to the command line.

7.1.5.3 APT Kernel Updates
..........................

The 'OpenSS7' 'apt(8)' repository definitions support the automatic
updating of kernel modules when kernels are updated.  When the system is
updated, using 'apt-get upgrade', 'OpenSS7' packages that are available
for an updated kernel will be installed automatically.

'OpenSS7' kernel module packages also support weak updates and when
kernels are updated to compatible kernels (e.g.  for security upgrades,
or normally for any updated within an Enterprise (LTS) distribution),
kernel modules are automatically applied against the updated kernel.

7.1.5.4 Setting up APT-RPM
..........................

To install or upgrade from the 'OpenSS7' 'apt-rpm' repositories using
'apt(8)', you will need to install the 'openss7-repo' RPM on your
system, as follows:

     $> REPO="https://user@www.openss7.org/repo/rpms"
     $> REPONOARCH="$REPO/mageia/1/x86_64/RPMS/noarch"
     $> REPORPM="$REPONOARCH/openss7-repo.noarch.rpm"
     $> wget $REPORPM
     $> sudo rpm -Uhv $REPORPM
     $> Username: anonymous
     $> Password: *******

The example, above, assumes that the distribution is 'mageia' and the
distribution release is '1' and the required architecture is 'x86_64'.
Another example would be '$REPO/mes/5.2/x86_64/RPMS/noarch', for using
'apt(8)' with MES (Mandriva Enterprise Server).

To obtain access to the repository at the level to which you are
entitled, you will have to respond to the 'Username:' query with the
user name with which you are registered with <https://www.openss7.org/>,
and to the 'Password:' query with your repository access password.(1)

'apt(8)' does not do a very good job of importing GPG signatures.  When
'apt-get' is reporting that there are no keys for the DEBs being
installed, the key can be imported directly into APT as follows:

     $> wget https://www.openss7.org/pubkey.asc
     $> sudo apt-key add pubkey.asc

You can test whether the 'apt(8)' repository is properly set up by
refreshing the repository and by listing the packages.

     $> sudo apt-get update
     $> sudo apt-cache gencaches
     $> apt-cache search openss7

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note that your repository access password is separate and
distinct from your web access password.

7.1.5.5 Using the APT-RPM Repository
....................................

Once the repository is set up, 'OpenSS7' includes a number of virtual
packages and packages recommendations that ease the installation and
removal of kernel modules, libraries and utilities.  Downloading,
configuring, building and installation for a single-kernel distribution
is as easy as:(1)

     $> sudo apt-get install openss7

Removing the package is as easy as:

     $> sudo apt-get remove openss7
     $> sudo apt-get purge openss7

To install the development packages for developing 'STREAMS' modules and
drivers, or applications that use the 'OpenSS7 Protocol Suites', install
the development packages using:

     $> sudo apt-get install openss7-devel

Of course, you are welcome to use a GUI based package manager, such as
'synaptic(8)'.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note that using 'apt-get(8)' in this way relies upon
recommendations being treated as strong dependencies.  This is normally
the case for default 'apt(8)' configuration files (particularly when
'synaptic' is installed); however, it is not necessarily the case.  If
you are not getting recommended packages being automatically installed,
add '--install-recommends' to the command line.

7.1.5.6 APT-RPM Kernel Updates
..............................

The 'OpenSS7' 'apt(8)' repository definitions support the automatic
updating of kernel modules when kernels are updated.  When the system is
updated, using 'apt-get upgrade', 'OpenSS7' packages that are available
for an updated kernel will be installed automatically.

'OpenSS7' kernel module packages also support weak updates and when
kernels are updated to compatible kernels (e.g.  for security upgrades,
or normally for any updated within an Enterprise (LTS) distribution),
kernel modules are automatically applied against the updated kernel.

7.2 Downloading
===============

The 'OpenSS7' package releases can be downloaded from the downloads page
of The OpenSS7 Project (http://www.openss7.org/download.html).  The
package is available as a binary RPM (for popular architectures) a
source RPM, Debian binary DEB and source DSC, or as a tar ball.  If you
are using a browsable viewer, you can obtain the 'OpenSS7' release of
'OpenSS7' from the links in the sections that follow.

By far the easiest (most repeatable and manageable) form for installing
and using the 'OpenSS7' packages is to download and install the
repository definition and use the distribution's native packaging tools.
Another (still repeatable and manageable) form for installing and using
'OpenSS7' packages is to download and install individual packages from
binary RPM or DEB.

If binary RPMs or DEBs are not available for your distribution, but your
distribution supports 'rpm(8)' (*note (*manpages*)rpm(8)::) or 'dpkg(1)'
(*note (*manpages*)dpkg(1)::), the next best method for installing and
using 'OpenSS7' packages is to download and rebuild the source RPMs or
DSCs.(1)

If your architecture does not support 'rpm(8)' or 'dpkg(1)' at all, or
you have special needs (such as cross-compiling for embedded targets or
for development), the final resort method is to download, configure,
build and install from tarball.  In this later case, the easiest way to
build and install 'OpenSS7' packages is from tarball.(2)

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note, however, that 'OpenSS7 Corporation' restricts access to
source RPMs and DSCs.

   (2) Note, however, that 'OpenSS7 Corporation' restricts access to
tarballs.

7.2.5 Downloading the Binary RPM
--------------------------------

To install from binary RPM, you will need several of the RPM for a
complete installation.  Binary RPM fall into several categories.  To
download and install a complete package requires the appropriate RPM
from each of the several categories below, as applicable.  Some release
packages do not provide RPMs in each of the several categories.

To install from Binary RPM, you will need all of the following kernel
independent packages for your architecture, and one of the
kernel-dependent packages from the next section.

Independent RPM
...............

Independent RPM are not dependent on the Linux kernel version.  For
example, the source package
'openss7-source-1.1.7.20150115-1.noarch.rpm', is not dependent on
kernel.

All of the following kernel independent RPM are required for your
architecture.  Binary RPMs listed here are for example only: additional
binary RPMs are available from the downloads site.  If your architecture
is not available, you can build binary RPM from the source RPM (*note
Building from the Source RPM::).

Architecture Independent
........................

Architecture independent RPMs are not dependent upon the processor
architecture.  That is, they are 'noarch' RPMs.  The architecture
independent RPMs in the 'OpenSS7' components are as follows:

'openss7-repo-1.1.7.20150115-1.noarch.rpm'

     This packages can be used to install or remove the repository
     source definitions for all OpenSS7 release packages.  On systems
     that support repository access, this package is required by the
     other packages.

'openss7-1.1.7.20150115-1.noarch.rpm'

     This package can be used to install or remove the entire OpenSS7
     package.  When installing, kernel modules will be installed
     automatically for the highest version kernel on your system.  When
     removing, all corresponding kernel modules will also be removed.

'openss7-base-1.1.7.20150115-1.noarch.rpm'

     The 'openss7-base' binary package contains the init scripts, test
     scripts, maintenance scripts and base system configuration files
     necessary for the operation of Linux Fast-STREAMS and the protocol
     suites contained in the OpenSS7 package.  It contains user and
     administrative documentation in '.info', '.pdf' and '.html' formats
     as well as sections 1, 4, 5 and 8 of the manual pages.  This binary
     package is required for any installation of the OpenSS7 package and
     is not architecture specific ('noarch').

'openss7-doc-1.1.7.20150115-1.noarch.rpm'

     The 'openss7-doc' binary package contains the documentation used in
     the development of applications and programs that use the package.
     It contains developer and programmer manuals in '.info', '.pdf' and
     '.html' formats as well as sections 2, 3, 7 and 9 of the manual
     pages and Javadoc HTML documentation.  Install this binary package
     if you are interested in developing Linux Fast-STREAMS drivers or
     modules or application programs for the protocol suites contained
     in the OpenSS7 package.  This package is massive and is not
     normally necessary except on a development system.  The package is
     not architecture specific ('noarch').

'openss7-javadoc-1.1.7.20150115-1.noarch.rpm'

     The 'openss7-javadoc' binary package contains Javadoc documentation
     for the OpenSS7 package.  Install this binary package if you are
     interested in developing JAIN applications or resource adaptors.
     This package is not normally required on other than a development
     system.  The package is not architecture specific ('noarch').

Architecture Dependent
......................

Architecture dependent RPMs are dependent upon the processor
architecture (but not on the specific kernel version).  That is, they
are 'x86_64' RPMs.  The architecture dependent RPMs in the 'OpenSS7'
components are as follows:

'openss7-lib-1.1.7.20150115-1.x86_64.rpm'

     The 'openss7-lib' binary package contains the run-time (shared
     object) libraries necessary to run applications programs and
     utilities developed for 'Linux Fast-STREAMS' and the protocol
     suites contained in the 'OpenSS7' package.  Also included are the
     libtool '.la' files describing the shared object libraries.  The
     binary package also provides administrative and configuration test
     utilities and commands associated with the OpenSS7 package.  Note
     that these utilities are needed for running the validation test
     suites contained in the 'openss7-base' binary package.

'openss7-java-1.1.7.20150115-1.x86_64.rpm'

     The 'openss7-java' binary package contains JAIN implementations for
     OpenSS7 Linux Fast-STREAMS and the associated protocol suites.  It
     includes jar files, JNI and CNI libraries, and gcj native compiled
     libraries.  It also includes SWIG implementations of Java
     interfaces for OpenSS7 API libraries.

'openss7-devel-1.1.7.20150115-1.x86_64.rpm'

     The 'openss7-devel' binary package contains library archives for
     static compilation, and header files to develop Linux Fast-STREAMS
     modules and drivers.  This also includes header files and static
     libraries required to compile Linux Fast-STREAMS and OpenSS7
     protocol suite applications programs.

     This binary package does not contain developer nor programmer
     documentation nor manual pages.  To obtain the developer and
     programmer documentation, load the 'openss7-doc' binary package.
     This package is architecture-specific but not kernel-specific.

     This package can be used to install or remove the development
     components of the OpenSS7 package.  When installing, 'openss7' an
     appropriate kernel module and kernel module development packages
     will also be installed.  When removing, the development package and
     all kernel module development packages will also be removed.

'openss7-debuginfo-1.1.7.20150115-1.x86_64.rpm'

     The 'openss7-debuginfo' binary package contains debugging
     information stripped from C-language libraries and C-language
     binary executables.  This package is required for full debugging of
     the executables contained in the 'openss7-lib' binary package.
     This package provides debug information for the OpenSS7 packages.
     Debug information is useful when developing applications that use
     the OpenSS7 package or when debugging the OpenSS7 package.

     This package can be used to install or remove the debug information
     components of the OpenSS7 package.  When installing, 'openss7' an
     appropriate kernel module and kernel module debug information
     packages will also be installed.  When removing, the debug
     information package and all kernel module debug information
     packages will also be removed.

'openss7-debugsource-1.1.7.20150115-1.x86_64.rpm'

     The 'openss7-debugsource' binary package contains debugging source
     references stripped from C-language libraries and C-language binary
     executables.  This package is required for source-level debugging
     of the executables contained in the 'openss7-lib' binary package.
     This package provides debug source for the OpenSS7 packages.  Debug
     source is useful when developing applications that use the OpenSS7
     package or when debugging the OpenSS7 package.

     This package can be used to install or remove the debug source
     components of the OpenSS7 package.  When installing, 'openss7' an
     appropriate kernel module and kernel module debug source packages
     will also be installed.  When removing, the debug source package
     and all kernel module debug source packages will also be removed.

7.2.5.1 Kernel-Dependent RPM
............................

Kernel-Dependent RPM are dependent on specific Linux Kernel Binary RPM
releases.  Packages are provided for popular distribution production
kernels.  Packages dependent upon a kernel RPM will have the '_kversion'
kernel package version in the package name.

One of the following Kernel-Dependent packages is required for your
architecture and kernel version.  If your architecture or kernel version
is not available, you can build binary RPM from the source RPM (see
*note Building from the Source RPM::).(1)

'openss7-3.17.6-1-ARCH-1.1.7.20150115-1.x86_64.rpm'

     The 'openss7-kernel' binary package contains the kernel modules
     that provide the Linux kernel Linux Fast-STREAMS drivers and
     modules.  This includes assorted drivers and modules for Linux
     Fast-STREAMS and additional OpenSS7 protocol suite components.
     This binary package also includes modprobe configuration files for
     the associated kernel modules.  This package is heavily tied to the
     kernel for which it and dependent components were compiled.  This
     package applies to kernel version 3.17.6-1-ARCH and requires
     components compiled for the same kernel.  If you cannot find a
     binary package that matches your kernel, rebuild for your kernel
     from the OpenSS7 package source rpm.

     This package can be used to install or remove the package for a
     specific kernel version.  When installing, the 'openss7' package
     will also be installed if necessary.  When removing the last kernel
     module package, the 'openss7' package will also be removed.

     Note that the version '3.17.6-1-ARCH' is just an example.  Use the
     version returned by '$(uname -r)' for the kernel for which you wish
     to install or remove the packages.

'openss7-devel-3.17.6-1-ARCH-1.1.7.20150115-1.x86_64.rpm'

     The 'openss7-devel-3.17.6-1-ARCH' binary package contains the
     kernel modules symbol information for development of additional
     Linux Fast-STREAMS kernel modules against the core kernel modules
     included in the 'openss7-3.17.6-1-ARCH' binary package.  This
     package is heavily tied to the core kernel modules and kernel for
     which it was compiled.  This package applies to core kernel modules
     '3.17.6-1-ARCH' for kernel version '3.17.6-1-ARCH'.  This package
     provides kernel debug information for the OpenSS7 package.  Kernel
     debug information is useful when developing kernel modules that use
     this package or when debugging kernel modules contained in the
     package.

     This package can be used to install or remove the development and
     debug packages for a specific kernel version.  When installing, the
     'openss7' and 'openss7-devel' packages will also be installed if
     necessary.  When removing the development and debug for kernel
     modules for the last kernel, the 'openss7-devel' package will also
     be removed.

     Note that the version '3.17.6-1-ARCH' is just an example.  Use the
     version returned by '$(uname -r)' for the kernel for which you wish
     to install or remove the packages.

     The 'openss7-devel-3.17.6-1-ARCH' package contains the module
     symbol version information for the 'kernel' package, above.  It is
     possible to load this package and compile modules that use the
     exported symbols without loading the actual kernel modules (from
     the 'kernel' package above).  This package is heavily tied to the
     kernel for which it was compiled.  This particular package applies
     to kernel version '3.17.6-1-ARCH'.(2)

'openss7-debuginfo-3.17.6-1-ARCH-1.1.7.20150115-1.x86_64.rpm'

'openss7-debugsource-3.17.6-1-ARCH-1.1.7.20150115-1.x86_64.rpm'

'openss7-source-3.17.6-1-ARCH-1.1.7.20150115-1.x86_64.rpm'

     The 'openss7-source-3.17.6-1-ARCH' package contains the configured
     source for a specific kernel.  This package contains source that is
     configured to the kernel for which it was configured.  This
     particular package contains configured source for kernel version
     '3.17.6-1-ARCH'(3) The 'openss7-source' package contains the source
     code necessary for building the OpenSS7 release.  It includes the
     'autoconf(1)' configuration utilities necessary to create and
     distribute tarballs, 'rpm' and 'deb'/'dsc'.

     The 'openss7-source-3.17.6-1-ARCH' binary package contains the
     source code necessary for building the OpenSS7 release for the
     kernel version '3.17.6-1-ARCH'.  It also includes the 'autoconf(1)'
     configuration utilities necessary to create and distribute this
     rpm.  However, to develop on the package, it would be better to use
     the tarball release.  Load this package if you need some files from
     the build that are not present in the 'openss7-devel-3.17.6-1-ARCH'
     package.

Configuration and Installation
..............................

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note that on 'Mandrakelinux', unlike other RPM kernel
distributions, kernel packages for the ix86 architectures are always
placed in i586 architecture packages regardless of the true processor
architecture of the kernel package.  'configure' detects this and builds
the appropriate packages.

   (2) Note that the '_kversion' of '3.17.6-1-ARCH' is only an example.

   (3) Note that the '_kversion' of '3.17.6-1-ARCH' is only an example.

7.2.6 Downloading the Debian DEB
--------------------------------

To install from binary DEB, you will need several of the DEB for a
complete installation.  Binary DEB fall into several categories.  To
download and install a complete package requires the appropriate DEB
from each of the several categories below, as applicable.  Some release
packages do not provide DEBs in each of the several categories.

To install from Binary DEB, you will need all of the following kernel
independent packages for your architecture, and one of the
kernel-dependent packages from the next section.

Independent DEB
...............

Independent DEB are not dependent on the Linux kernel version.  For
example, the source package 'openss7-source_1.1.7.20150115-0_i386.deb',
is not dependent on kernel.

All of the following kernel independent DEB are required for your
architecture.  Binary DEBs listed here are for example only: additional
binary DEBs are available from the downloads site.  If your architecture
is not available, you can build binary DEB from the Debian DSC (see
*note Building from the Debian DSC::).

Kernel-Dependent DEB
....................

Kernel-Dependent DEB are dependent on specific Linux Kernel Binary DEB
releases.  Packages are provided for popular released 'Debian' kernels.
Packages dependent upon 'Debian' or other kernel DEB will have the
'_kversion' kernel package version in the package name.

One of the following Kernel-Dependent packages is required for your
architecture and kernel version.  If your architecture or kernel version
is not on the list, you can build binary DEB from the source DEB (see
*note Building from the Debian DSC::).(2)

openss7-core-3.17.6-1-ARCH_1.1.7.20150115-0_i386.deb
     The 'openss7-core' package contains the loadable kernel modules
     that depend only on the kernel.  This package is heavily tied to
     the kernel for which it was compiled.  This particular package
     applies to kernel version '3.17.6-1-ARCH'.(3)

openss7-info-3.17.6-1-ARCH_1.1.7.20150115-0_i386.deb

     subpackage above).  This package is heavily tied to the kernel for
     which it was compiled.  This particular package applies to kernel
     version '3.17.6-1-ARCH'.(5)

Configuration and Installation
..............................

To configure, build and install the Debian DEB, *note Configuring the
Debian DEB::.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note that not all release packages contain devices.  Only
packages that provide STREAMS character device drivers need devices, and
then only when the 'specfs' or 'devfsd' is not being used.

   (2) Note that on 'Mandrakelinux', unlike other DEB kernel
distributions, kernel packages for the ix86 architectures are always
placed in i586 architecture packages regardless of the true processor
architecture of the kernel package.  'configure' detects this and builds
the appropriate packages.

   (3) Note that the '_kversion' of '3.17.6-1-ARCH' is only an example.
Note also that only release packages that contain kernel modules will
contain a 'core' subpackage.

   (4) Note that only release packages that contain kernel modules and
that export versioned symbols will contain a 'info' subpackage.  Also,
this subpackage is only applicable to 2.4 series kernels and is not
necessary and not built for 2.6 or 3.x series kernels.

   (5) Note that the '_kversion' of '3.17.6-1-ARCH' is only an example.

7.2.7 Downloading the Source RPM
--------------------------------

If you cannot obtain a binary RPM for your architecture, or would like
to roll you own binary RPM, download the following source RPM.

openss7-1.1.7.20150115-1.src.rpm
     This is the source RPM for the package.  From this source RPM it is
     possible to build binary RPM for any supported architecture and for
     any 2.4, 2.6 or 3.x kernel.

Configuration
.............

To configure the source RPM, *note Configuring the Source RPM::.

7.2.8 Downloading the Debian DSC
--------------------------------

If you cannot obtain a binary DEB for your architecture, or would like
to roll your own DEB, download the following Debian DSC.

openss7_1.1.7.20150115-0.dsc
openss7_1.1.7.20150115-0.tar.gz
     This is the Debian DSC for the package.  From this Debian DSC it is
     possible to build binary DEB for any supported architecture and for
     any 2.4, 2.6 or 3.x kernel.

Configuration

as follows:

openss7-1.1.7.20150115.tar.bz2
openss7-1.1.7.20150115.tar.xz
     These are the 'tar(1)' balls for the release.  These 'tar(1)' balls
     contain the 'autoconf(1)' distribution which includes all the
     source necessary for building and installing the package.  These
     tarballs will even build Source RPM and Binary RPM on 'rpm(8)'
     architectures and Debian DSC and DEB on 'dpkg(1)' architectures.

The tar ball may be downloaded easily with 'wget(1)' as follows:

     % wget https://www.openss7.org/repo/tarballs/openss7-1.1.7.20150115.tar.bz2

or

     % wget https://www.openss7.org/repo/tarballs/openss7-1.1.7.20150115.tar.xz

Note that you will need an 'OpenSS7 Project' user name and password to
download release candidates (which are only available to subscribers and
sponsors of the 'OpenSS7 Project').

Unpacking the Archive
.....................

After downloading one of the tar balls, unpack the archive using one of
the following commands:

     % wget https://www.openss7.org/repo/tarballs/openss7-1.1.7.20150115.tar.bz2
     % tar -xjvf openss7-1.1.7.20150115.tar.bz2

or

     % wget https://www.openss7.org/repo/tarballs/openss7-1.1.7.20150115.tar.xz
     % tar -xJvf openss7-1.1.7.20150115.tar.xz

Either will create a subdirectory name 'openss7-1.1.7.20150115'
containing all of the files and subdirectories for the 'OpenSS7'
package.

7.2.10 Downloading from CVS
---------------------------

If you are a subscriber or sponsor of The OpenSS7 Project
(http://www.openss7.org/) with CVS archive access privileges then you
can download release, mid-release or release candidate versions of the
'OpenSS7' package from the project CVS archive.

The OpenSS7 package is located in the 'openss7' module of '/var/cvs'.
For release tag information, *note Releases::.

To access the archive from the project CVS pserver, use the following
commands to check out a version from the archive:

     % export CVSROOT=':pserver:USERNAME@cvs.openss7.org:2401/var/cvs'
     % cvs login
     Password: *********
     % cvs co -r openss7_1.1.7.20150115 openss7
     % cvs logout

It is, of course, possible to check out by date or by other criteria.
For more information, see 'cvs(1)' (*note (*manpages*)cvs(1)::).

Preparing the CVS Working Directory
...................................

Although public releases of the 'OpenSS7' package do not require
reconfiguration, creating a configurable directory from the CVS archive
requires tools not normally distributed with the other releases.

The build host requires the following GNU tools:

     * 'm4 1.4.17'
     * 'autoconf 2.69'
     * 'automake 1.14.1'
     * 'libtool 2.4.2'
     * 'gettext 0.19.2'
     * 'flex 2.5.39'
     * 'bison 3.0.2'
     * 'swig 3.0.2'
     * 'xz-5.0.7'

Most desktop development GNU/Linux distributions will have these tools;
however, some non-development or server-style installations might not
and they must be installed separately.(1)

Also, these tools can be acquired from the FSF website
(http://www.fsf.org/) in the free software directory, and also at the
following locations:

   * m4-1.4.17 (http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/m4-1.4.17.tar.bz2)
   * autoconf-2.69
     (http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/autoconf-2.69.tar.xz)
   * automake-1.14.1
     (http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/automake-1.14.1.tar.xz)
   * libtool-2.4.2
     (http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/libtool-2.4.2.tar.gz)
   * gettext-0.19.2
     (http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/gettext-0.19.2.tar.gz)
   * flex-2.5.39 (http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/flex-2.5.39.tar.bz2)
   * bison-3.0.2 (http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/bison-3.0.2.tar.xz)
   * swig-3.0.2 (http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/swig-3.0.2.tar.gz)
   * xz-5.0.7 (http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/xz-5.0.7.tar.xz)

It should be stressed that, in particular, the 'autoconf(1)', and
'automake(1)', must be at version releases '2.68' and '1.11.1'.  _The
versions normally distributed in some mainstream GNU/Linux distributions
are, in fact, much older than these versions._(2)  GNU version of these
packages configured and installed to default directories will install in
'/usr/local/' allowing them to coexist with distribution installed
versions.

For building documentation, the build host also requires the following
documentation tools:

     * 'gs 9.15' or 'ghostscript 9.15', or newer.
     * 'tetex 3.14159265' or 'texlive 2014', or newer.
     * 'texinfo 5.2' or newer.
     * 'transfig 3.2.5e' or newer.
     * 'imagemagick 6.8.0.8' or 'ImageMagick 6.8.0.8', or newer.
     * 'groff 1.22.2' or newer.
     * 'gnuplot 4.6' or newer.
     * 'latex2html 2012 (1.2)' or newer.

Most desktop GNU/Linux distributions will have these tools; however,
some server-style installations (e.g.  'Ubuntu'-server, 'SLES 9' or
'Fedora 6 or 7') will not and they must be installed separately.(3)

Note that 'texinfo 4.12' must not be used as it breaks the build
process.

For uncooked manual pages, the entire 'groff(1)' package is required on
older 'Debian' and 'Ubuntu' systems (the base package did not include
'grefer(1)' which is used extensively by uncooked manual pages).  The
following will get what you need on older systems:

     Debian: % apt-get install groff_ext
     Ubuntu: % apt-get install groff

On newer systems, simply:

     % apt-get install groff

In addition, the build host requires a complete tool chain for compiling
for the target host, including kernel tools such as 'genksyms(8)' (*note
(*manpages*)genksyms(8)::) and others.

If you wish to package 'rpms' on an 'rpm(8)' system, or 'debs' on a
'dpkg(1)' system, you will need the appropriate tool chain.  Systems
based on 'rpm(8)' typically have the necessary tool chain available,
however, 'dpkg(1)' systems do not.  The following on a 'Debian' or
'Ubuntu' system will get what you need:

     % apt-get install debhelper
     % apt-get install fakeroot

To generate a configuration script and the necessary scriptlets required
by the GNU 'autoconf(1)' system, execute the following commands on the
working directory:

     % autoreconf -fiv openss7

where, 'openss7' is the name of the directory to where the working copy
was checked out under the previous step.  This command generates the
'configure' script and other missing pieces that are normally
distributed with the release Tar Balls, SRPMs and DSCs.

Make sure that 'autoreconf --version' returns '2.68'.  Otherwise, you
may need to perform something like the following:

     % PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
     % autoreconf -fiv openss7

After reconfiguring the directory, the package can then be configured
and built using the same instructions as are used for the Tar Ball, see
*note Configuring the Tar Ball::, and *note Building from the Tar
Ball::.

Do note, however, that 'make(1)' will rebuild the documentation that is
normally released with the package.  Additional tools may be necessary
for building the documentation.  To avoid building and installing the
documentation, use the '--disable-devel' or '--disable-docs' option to
configure described in *note Configuring the Tar Ball::.

When configuring the package in a working directory and while working a
change-compile-test cycle that involves configuration macros or
documentation, I find it of great advantage to invoke the GNU
'configure' options '--enable-maintainer-mode',
'--enable-dependency-tracking' and '--disable-devel'.  The first of
these three options will add maintainer-specific targets to any
generated 'Makefile', the second option will invoke automatic dependency
tracking within the 'Makefile' so rebuilds after changes to macro,
source or documentation files will be automatically rebuilt; and the
last option will suppress rebuilding and reinstalling documentation
manual pages and header files.  Header files will still be available
under the '/usr/src' directory.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Older version of bison (2.0) and the older version of flex
(2.5.4a) are also suitable.  Where possible, use the more recent bison
3.0.2 and flex 2.5.39.

   (2) A notable exception is Debian and Fedora 7.  Note that on Fedora
7 the 'gettext-devel' package must be installed.

   (3) In particular, for 'CentOS', 'Fedora 6 or 7', the 'tetex-latex'
and 'gnuplot' packages must be loaded as well.  Note also that the
'latex2html' used to be part of the 'textex' package (or subpackages)
but is now often packaged on its own.  Recent distributions such as SUSE
11.0 and Fedora 9 use the 'texlive' package instead of the 'tetex'
package.

7.3 Configuration
=================

7.3.1 Configuring the Binary RPM
--------------------------------

In general the binary RPM do not require any configuration, however,
during installation it is possible to relocate some of the installation
directories.  This allows some degree of customization.  Relocations
that are available on the binary RPM are as follows:

'openss7-core-3.17.6-1-ARCH-1.1.7.20150115-1.i686.rpm'
     '/lib/modules/3.17.6-1-ARCH'
          This relocatable directory contains the kernel modules that
          provide the OpenSS7 core, drivers and modules.(1)

'openss7-info-3.17.6-1-ARCH-1.1.7.20150115-1.i686.rpm'
     '/usr/include/openss7/3.17.6-1-ARCH'
          This relocatable directory contains the kernel module exported
          symbol information that allows other kernel modules to be
          compiled against the correct version of the openss7
          package.(2)

'openss7-dev-1.1.7.20150115-1.i686.rpm'
     (not relocatable)

'openss7-devel-1.1.7.20150115-1.i686.rpm'
     '/usr/lib'
          This relocatable directory contains openss7 libraries.
     '/usr/include/openss7'
          This relocatable directory contains openss7 header files.

'openss7-doc-1.1.7.20150115-1.i686.rpm'
     '/usr/share/doc'
          This relocatable directory contains all package specific
          documentation (including this manual).  The subdirectory in
          this directory is the 'openss7-1.1.7.20150115' directory.
     '/usr/share/info'
          This relocatable directory contains info files (including the
          info version of this manual).
     '/usr/share/man'
          This relocatable directory contains manual pages.

'openss7-lib-1.1.7.20150115-1.i686.rpm'
     '/usr/lib'
          This relocatable directory contains the run-time shared
          libraries necessary to run applications programs and utilities
          developed for OpenSS7.
     '/usr/share/locale'
          This relocatable directory contains the locale information for
          shared library files.

'openss7-source-1.1.7.20150115-1.i686.rpm'
     '/usr/src'
          This relocatable directory contains the source code.

'openss7-util-1.1.7.20150115-1.i686.rpm'
     '/usr/bin'
          This relocatable directory contains binary programs and
          utilities.
     '/usr/sbin'
          This relocatable directory contains system binary programs and
          utilities.
     '/usr/libexec'
          This relocatable directory contains test programs.
     '/etc'
          This relocatable directory contains 'init' scripts and
          configuration information.

Installation

To install the binary RPM, *note Installing the Binary RPM::.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note that the '_kversion' of '3.17.6-1-ARCH' is only an example.

   (2) Note that the '_kversion' of '3.17.6-1-ARCH' is only an example.
Also, note that the 'info' subpackage is only applicable to the 2.4
kernel series.

7.3.2 Configuring the Debian DEB
--------------------------------

In general the binary DEB do not require any configuration.

Installation
............

To install the Debian DEB, *note Installing the Debian DEB::.

7.3.3 Configuring the Source RPM
--------------------------------

When building from the source RPM (*note Building from the Source
RPM::), the rebuild process uses a number of macros from the user's
'.rpmmacros' file as described in 'rpm(8)' (*note (*manpages*)rpm(8)::).

Following is an example of the '~/.rpmmacros' file that I use for
rebuilding RPMS:

     #
     # RPM macros for building rpms
     #

     %vendor OpenSS7 Corporation
     %distribution OpenSS7
     %disturl http://www.openss7.org/
     %packager Brian Bidulock <bidulock@openss7.org>
     %url http://www.openss7.org/

     %_signature gpg
     %_gpg_path /home/brian/.gnupg
     %_gpg_name openss7@openss7.org
     %_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg

     %_source_payload w9.bzdio
     %_binary_payload w9.bzdio

     %_unpackaged_files_terminate_build 1
     %_missing_doc_files_terminate_build 1
     %_use_internal_dependency_generator 0
     %_repackage_all_erasures 0
     %_rollback_transaction_on_failure 0

     %configure2_5x %configure
     %make make


When building from the source RPM (*note Building from the Source
RPM::), it is possible to pass a number of additional configuration
options to the 'rpmbuild(1)' process.

The additional configuration options are described below.

Note that distributions that use older versions of rpm do not have the
'--with' or '--without' options defined.  To achieve the same effect as:
     --with someparm=somearg
do:
     --define "_with_someparm --with-someparm=somearg"

This is a generic description of common 'rpmbuild(1)' options.  Not all
'rpmbuild(1)' options are applicable to all SRPMs.

'--define "_kversion $PACKAGE_KVERSION"'
     Specifies the kernel version other than the running kernel for
     which to build.  If '_kversion' is not defined when rebuilding, the
     environment variable PACKAGE_KVERSION is used.  If the environment
     variable PACKAGE_KVERSION is not defined, then the version of the
     running kernel (i.e.  discovered with 'uname -r') is used as the
     target version for kernel-dependent packages.  This option can also
     be defined in an '.rpmspec' file using the macro name '_kversion'.

'--with checks'
'--without checks'
     Enable or disable preinstall checks.  Each packages supports a
     number of preinstall checks that can be performed by invoking the
     'check' target with 'automake(1)'.  These currently consist of
     checking each kernel module for unresolved kernel symbols, checking
     for documentation for exported kernel module symbols, checking for
     documentation for exported library symbols, checking for standard
     options for build and installable programs, checking for
     documentation for built and installable programs.  Normally these
     checks are only run in maintainer mode, but can be enabled and
     disabled with this option.

'--with k-optimize=HOW'
'--without k-optimize'
     Specify 'HOW' optimization, NORMAL, SIZE, SPEED or QUICK.  SIZE
     compiles kernel modules '-Os', SPEED compiles kernel modules '-O3',
     and QUICK compiles kernel modules '-O0'.  The default is NORMAL.
     Use with care.

'--with cooked-manpages'
'--without cooked-manpages'
     Some systems do not like 'grefer(1)' references in manual pages.(1)
     This option will cook 'soelim(1)', 'refer(1)', 'tbl(1)' and
     'pic(1)' commands from the manual pages and also strip 'groff(1)'
     comments.  The default is to leave manual pages uncooked: they are
     actually smaller that way.

'--with public'
'--without public'
     Release public packages or private packages.  The default is to
     release public packages.

'--with k-debug'
'--without k-debug'
     Specifies whether kernel debugging is to be performed on the build
     kernel modules.  Mutually exclusive with 'test' and 'safe' below.
     This has the effect of removing static and inline attributes from
     functions and invoking all debugging macros in the code.  The
     default is to not perform kernel debugging.

'--with k-test'
'--without k-test'
     Specifies whether kernel testing is to be performed.  Mutually
     exclusive with 'debug' above and 'safe' below.  This has the effect
     of removing static and inline attributes from functions and
     invoking most debugging macros in the code.  The default is to not
     perform kernel testing.

'--with k-safe'
'--without k-safe'
     Specifies whether kernel saftey is to be performed.  Mutually
     exclusive with 'debug' and 'test' above.  This has the effect of
     invoking some more pedantic assertion macros in the code.  The
     default is not to apply kernel safety.

'--with k-inline'
'--without k-inline'
     Specifies whether kernel 'inline' functions are to be placed
     inline.  This has the effect of adding the '-finline-functions'
     flag to CFLAGS for compiling kernel modules.  Linux 2.4 kernels are
     normally compiled '-O2' which does not respect the 'inline'
     directive.  This compiles kernel modules with '-finline-functions'
     to get closer to '-O3' optimization.  For better optimization
     controls, *note Configuring the Tar Ball::.

'--with k-modversions'
'--without k-modversions'
     Specifies whether kernel symbol versions are to be applied to
     symbols exported by package kernel modules.  The default is to
     version exported module symbols.

'--with devfs'
'--without devfs'
     Specifies whether the build is for a device file system daemon
     enabled system with autoloading, or not.  The default is to build
     for 'devfsd(1)' autoloading when CONFIG_DEVFS_FS is defined in the
     target kernel.  The 'rebuild' target uses this option to signal to
     the RPM spec file that the 'dev' subpackage need not be built.

'--with devel'
'--without devel'
     Specifies whether to build development environment packages such as
     those that include header files, static libraries, manual pages and
     'texinfo(1)' documentation.  The default is to build development
     environment packages.  This option can be useful when building for
     an embedded target where only the run-time components are desired.

'--with docs'
'--without docs'
     Specifies whether to build and install major documentation such
     manual pages and 'texinfo(1)' documentation.  The default is to
     build and install documentation.  This option can be useful when
     building for an embedded target where only the run-time and static
     compile components are desired, but not major documentation.  This
     option does not override the setting of '--without devel'.

'--with tools'
'--without tools'
     Specifies whether user space packages are to be built.  The default
     is to build user space packages.  This option can be useful when
     rebuilding for multiple architectures and target kernels.  The
     'rebuild' 'automake(1)' target uses this feature when rebuilding
     for all available architectures and kernels, to rebuild user
     packages once per architecture instead of once per kernel.

'--with modules'
'--without modules'
     Specifies whether kernel modules packages are to be built.  The
     default is to build kernel module packages.  This option can be
     useful when rebuilding for multiple architectures and target
     kernels.  The 'rebuild' 'automake(1)' target uses this feature to
     rebuild for all available architectures and kernels.

In addition, the following 'rpm' options, specific to the OpenSS7
package are available:

'--without streams-irq'
     Disables STREAMS irq suppression.  Normally the STREAMS scheduler
     protects itself and its datastructures from races due to hard
     interrupts by suppressing interrupts during critical sections.  As
     not all drivers and modules contain hard interrupts, this option
     allows hard interrupts to be enabled while running critical
     sections.  The purpose of this option was primarily for profiling.
     The default is to enable STREAMS irq suppression.

'--without streams-stats'
     Disable STREAMS statistics counting.  Normally the STREAMS
     scheduler will automatically count the number of entries to open,
     close, put and service procedures for a queue pair whenever the
     'module_stats' structure is defined and attached to the 'qinit'
     structure by the module or driver.  This is not exact SVR4.2 MP
     behaviour (where it is the responsibility of the module or drive to
     perform these counts).  This option disables the feature.  The
     default is to enable STREAMS statistics counting.

'--without streams-syncqs'
     Disable STREAMS synchronization queues.  Normally the STREAMS
     scheduler will permit modules and drivers that are written for
     syncrhonization (such as SVR4.2 MP synchronization, Solaris
     perimeters, etc.)  and will perform synchronization protection for
     these modules.  This option disables synchronization queues.  When
     disabled, only fully multiprocessor safe drivers and modules
     (marked with the D_MP flag), will be loaded.  The default is to
     enable STREAMS synchronization queues.

'--without streams-utils'
     Disable additional STREAMS utilities.  Normally 'strsetup' and
     'strload' utility configuration files are included in the build and
     installed.  This option disables build and installation of the
     'strsetup' and 'strload' configuration files.  The default is to
     enable additional STREAMS utilities.

'--without big-compile'
     Disable compilation as one big computational unit.  The default is
     to build as one big computational unit.  Do not use this option.

'--with streams-fifos'
     Enable overriding of system FIFOs with STREAMS-based FIFOs.  The
     default is to not override system FIFOs with STREAMS-based FIFOs.

'--with streams-kthreads'
     Set STREAMS kernel thread operation to NICE, NORMAL, RT or NO.
     When set to NICE, the STREAMS scheduler will be based on kernel
     threads that run with a 'nice -19' priority.  When set to NORMAL,
     the STREAMS scheduler sill be based on kernel threas thar run with
     'nice -0' priority.  When set to RT, the STREAMS scheduler will be
     based on kernel threads that run with real-time priority 'nice
     -99'.  When set to NO, soft-interrupts will be used for the STREAMS
     scheduler rather than kernel threads.  This option was primarily
     for performance testing.  Do no use this option.  The default
     STREAMS kernel thread pirority is NICE.

'--with module-sth'
'--without module-sth'
     Enables or disables the 'sth' (Stream head) module.  When enabled,
     the 'sth' module will be compiled into the 'streams' kernel module;
     when disabled, the 'sth' module will not be included at all.  Note
     that disabling the 'sth' module will cause all Streams to fail.
     The default is for the 'sth' module to be created as a separate
     module.

'--with module-srvmod'
'--without module-srvmod'
     Enables or disables the 'srvmod' module.  When enabled, the
     'srvmod' module will be compiled into the 'streams' kernel module;
     when disabled, the 'srvmod' module will not be included at all.
     Note that disabling the 'srvmod' module will cause conformance
     suites to fail.  The default is for the 'srvmod' module to be
     created as a separate module.

'--with module-nullmod'
'--without module-nullmod'
     Enables or disables the 'nullmod' module.  When enabled, the
     'nullmod' module will be compiled into the 'streams' kernel module;
     when disabled, the 'nullmod' module will not be included at all.
     Note that disabling the 'nullmod' module will cause conformance
     suites to fail.  The default is for the 'nuls' module to be created
     as a separate module.

'--with module-pipemod'
'--without module-pipemod'
     Enables or disables the 'pipemod' module.  When enabled, the
     'pipemod' module will be compiled into the 'streams' kernel module;
     when disabled, the 'pipemod' module will not be included at all.
     Note that disabling the 'pipemod' module will cause conformance
     suites to fail.  The default is for the 'pipemod' module to be
     created as a separate module.

'--with module-connld'
'--without module-connld'
     Enables or disables the 'connld' module.  When enabled, the
     'connld' module will be compiled into the 'streams' kernel module;
     when disabled, the 'connld' module will not be included at all.
     Note that disabling the 'connld' module will cause conformance
     suites to fail.  The default is for the 'connld' module to be
     created as a separate module.

'--with module-sc'
'--without module-sc'
     Enables or disables the 'sc' module.  When enabled, the 'sc' module
     will be compiled into the 'streams' kernel module; when disabled,
     the 'sc' module will not be included at all.  Note that disabling
     the 'sc' module will cause conformance suites to fail.  The default
     is for the 'sc' module to be created as a separate module.

'--with module-testmod'
'--without module-testmod'

     Enables or disables the 'irix' compatibility module.  When enabled,
     the 'irix' compatibility module will be compiled into the 'stream'
     kernel module; when disabled, the 'irix' compatibility module will
     not be included at all.  The default is for the 'irix'
     compatibility module to be created as a separate module.

'--with compat-mac'
'--without compat-mac'
     Enables or disables the 'mac' compatibility module.  When enabled,
     the 'mac' compatibility module will be compiled into the 'stream'
     kernel module; when disabled, the 'mac' compatibility module will
     not be included at all.  The default is for the 'mac' compatibility
     module to be created as a separate module.

'--without xti-servtype'
     Disables XTI service type checks in the XTI/TLI Library.  Normally,
     the XTI/TLI Library will check for the service type of the endpoint
     and will reject commands that are not defined for the corresponding
     service type.  When enabled, this option causes the XTI/TLI Library
     to simply issue the corresponding primitive to the underlying
     driver and to allow the driver to determine whether the primitive
     is supported.  The default is for the XTI/TLI Library to check for
     XTI service type.

'--without xti-states'
     Disables XTI state checks in the XTI/TLI Library.  Normally the
     XTI/TLI Library will check for the state of the endpoint and will
     reject commands that would place the interface out of state.  When
     enabled, this option causes the XTI/TLI Library to simply issue the
     corresponding primitive to the underlying driver and to allow the
     driver to determine whether the interface is out of state.  The
     default is for the XTI/TLI Library to check for XTI state.

'--with sctp-slow-verification'
     Enable slow verification of addresses and tags.  When a message
     comes from an SCTP endpoint with the correct verification tag, it
     is not necessary to check whether it is from a correct source
     address to identify the SCTP association to which it belongs.  When
     you disable this feature ('--without sctp-slow-verification'),
     source addresses are not checked and it is up to firewall
     implementations to thwart attackers of the verification tag.  When
     you enable this feature ('--with sctp-slow-verification'), you get
     RFC 2960 compliant operation, but at great cost to SCTP
     performance.  This option defaults to 'disabled'.

'--with sctp-throttle-heartbeats'
     Enable heartbeat throttling.  Special feature of OpenSS7 that is
     not mentioned in RFC 2960.  When you enable this feature ('--with
     sctp-throttle-heartbeats'), OpenSS7 will throttle the rate at which
     it responds to heartbeats to the system control HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL.
     This makes SCTP more resilient to implementations which flood
     heartbeat messages.  For RFC 2960 compliant operation, disable this
     feature ('--without sctp-throttle-heartbeats').  This option
     defaults to 'disabled'.

'--with sctp-discard-ootb'
     Enable discard of out-of-the-blue packets.  RFC 2960 requires the
     implementation to send 'ABORT' to some OOTB packets (packets for
     which no SCTP association exists).  Sending 'ABORT' chunks to
     unverified source addresses with the T bit set opens SCTP to blind
     masquerade attacks.  Not sending them may lead to delays at the
     peer endpoint aborting associations where our 'ABORT' has been lost
     and the socket is already closed or if we have restarted and the
     peer still has open associations to us.  If you enable this feature
     ('--with sctp-discard-ootb'), SCTP will discard all OOTB packets.
     This is necessary if another SCTP stack is being run on the same
     machine.  Therefore, if the OpenSS7 package is included on an
     OpenSS7 SCTP kernel, this feature is automatically enabled.  For
     RFC 2960 compliant operation, disable this feature ('--without
     sctp-discard-ootb').  This option defaults to 'disabled' for
     non-OpenSS7 SCTP kernels, and 'enabled' for OpenSS7 SCTP kernels.

'--with sctp-exteded-ip-support'
     Enable extended IP support for SCTP. This provides extended IP
     support for SCTP for things like IP Transparent Proxy and IP
     Masquerading.  This is experimental stuff.  If in doubt, disable
     this feature ('--without sctp-expended-ip-support').  This option
     defaults to 'disabled'.

'--without sctp-hmac-sha1'
     Disable SHA-1 HMAC. This provides the ability to use the FIPS 180-1
     (SHA-1) message authentication code in SCTP cookies.  If you enable
     this feature ('--with sctp-hmac-sha1'), when the appropriate sysctl
     is set, SCTP will use the SHA-1 HMAC when signing cookies in the
     'INIT-ACK' chunk.  If disable this feature ('--without
     sctp-hmac-sha1'), the SHA-1 HMAC will be unavailable for use with
     SCTP. This option defaults to 'enabled' on big-endian
     architectures, and 'disabled' otherwise.

'--without sctp-hmac-md5'
     Disable MD5 HMAC. This provides the ability to use the MD5 (RFC
     1321) message authentication code in SCTP cookies.  If you enable
     this feature ('--with sctp-hmac-md5'), when the appropriate sysctl
     is set, SCTP will use the MD5 HMAC when signing cookies in the INIT
     ACK chunk.  If you disable this feature ('--without
     sctp-hmac-md5'), the MD5 HMAC will be unavailable for use with
     SCTP. This option defaults to 'enabled' on little-endian
     architectures, and 'disabled' otherwise.

'--with sctp-adler32'
     Enable Adler32 checksum.  This provides the ability to use the
     older RFC 2960 Adler32 checksum.  If CONFIG_SCTP_CRC_32 below is
     not selected, the Adler32 checksum is always provided.  This option
     defaults to 'disabled'.

'--without sctp-crc32c'
     Disable CRC-32C checksum.  This provides the ability to use the
     newer CRC-32c checksum as described in RFC 3309.  When this is
     selected and CONFIG_SCTP_ADLER_32 is not selected above, then the
     only checksum that will be used is the CRC-32c checksum.  This
     option defaults to 'enabled'.

'--with sctp-throttle-passiveopens'
     Enable throttling of passive opens.  Special feature of Linux SCTP
     not mentioned in RFC 2960.  When secure algorithms are used for
     signing cookies, the implementation becomes vulnerable to INIT and
     'COOKIE-ECHO' flooding.  If you enable this feature ('--with
     sctp-throttle-passiveopens'), SCTP will only allow one INIT and one
     'COOKIE-ECHO' to be processed in each interval corresponding to the
     sysctl sctp_throttle_itvl.  Setting sctp_throttle_itvl to 0 defeats
     this function.  If you disable this feature ('--without
     sctp-throttle-passiveopens'), each INIT and 'COOKIE-ECHO' will be
     processed.  This option defaults to 'disabled'.

'--without sctp-ecn'
     Enable explicit congestion notification.  This enables support for
     Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) chunks in SCTP messages as
     defined in RFC 2960 and RFC 3168.  It also adds syctl
     (/proc/net/ipv4/sctp_ecn) which allows ECN for SCTP to be disabled
     at runtime.  This option defaults to 'enabled'.

'--without sctp-lifetimes'
     Enable SCTP message lifetimes.  This enables support for message
     lifetimes as described in RFC 2960.  When enabled, message
     lifetimes can be set on messages.  See sctp(7).  This feature is
     always enabled when Partial Reliability Support is set.  This
     option defaults to 'enabled'.

'--without sctp-add-ip'
     Enable ADD-IP. This enables support for ADD-IP as described in
     draft-ietf-tsvwg-addip-sctp-07.txt.  This allows the addition and
     removal of IP addresses from existing connections.  This is
     experimental stuff.  This option defaults to 'enabled'.

'--without sctp-adaptation-layer-info'
     Enable ALI. This enables support for the Adaptation Layer
     Information parameter described in
     draft-ietf-tsvwg-addip-sctp-07.txt for communicating application
     layer information bits at initialization.  This is experimental
     stuff.  This option defaults to 'enabled'.

'--without sctp-partial-reliability'
     Enable SCTP Partial Reliability (PR-SCTP). This enables support for
     PR-SCTP as described in draft-stewart-tsvwg-prsctp-03.txt.  This
     allows for partial reliability of message delivery on a "timed
     reliability" basis.  This is experimental stuff.  This option
     defaults to 'enabled'.

'--without sctp-error-generator'
     Disable the SCTP error generator.  This provides an internal error
     generator that can be accessed with socket options for testing SCTP
     operation under packet loss.  You will need this option to run some
     of the test programs distributed with the SCTP module.  This option
     defaults to 'enabled'.

'--without ip'
     Remove the second generation IP driver from the build.  The default
     is to include the second generation IP driver in the build.

'--without udp'
     Remove the second generation UDP driver from the build.  The
     default is to include the second generation UDP driver in the
     build.

'--without raw'
     Remove the second generation RAWIP driver from the build.  The
     default is to include the second generation RAWIP driver in the
     build.

'--without tcp'
     Remove the second generation TCP driver from the build.  The
     default is to include the second generation TCP driver in the
     build.

'--with sctp'
     Enable the version 1 driver in the build.  This option defaults to
     'disabled'.

'--without sctp2'
     Enable the Release 2 driver in the build.  This option defaults to
     'enabled'.

In general, the default values of these options are sufficient for most
purposes and no options need be provided when rebuilding the Source
RPMs.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) In particular, some 'Debian' systems do not load the 'groff(1)'
extensions package and do not have 'grefer(1)' installed.  Although this
is an oversight on the configuration of the particular 'Debian' system,
we accomodate such misconfiguration with this feature.

7.3.4 Configuring the Debian DSC
--------------------------------

The Debian DSC can be configured by passing options in the environment
variable BUILD_DEBOPTIONS.  The options placed in this variable take the
same form as those passed to the 'configure' script, *note Configuring
the Tar Ball::.  For an example, *note Building from the Debian DSC::.

7.3.5 Configuring the Tar Ball
------------------------------

All of the normal GNU 'autoconf(1)' configuration options and
environment variables apply.  Additional options and environment
variables are provided to tailor or customize the build and are
described below.

7.3.5.1 Configure Options
.........................

This is a generic description of common 'configure' options that are in
addition to those provided by 'autoconf(1)', 'automake(1)', 'libtool(1)'
and 'gettext(1)'.

Following are the additional 'configure' options, their meaning and use:

'--enable-checks'
'--disable-checks'
     Enable or disable preinstall checks.  Each release package supports
     a number of preinstall checks that can be performed by invoking the
     'check' target with 'make(1)'.  These currently consist of checking
     each kernel module for unresolved kernel symbols, checking for
     documentation for exported kernel module symbols, checking for
     documentation for exported library symbols, checking for standard
     options for build and installable programs, checking for
     documentation for built and installable programs.  Normally these
     checks are only run in maintainer mode, but can be enabled and
     disabled with this option.

'--enable-autotest'
'--disable-autotest'
     Enable or disable pre- and post-installation testing.  Each release
     package supports a number of 'autotest' test suites that can be
     performed by invoking the 'installcheck' target with 'make(1)'.
     These currently consist of running installed modules, commands and
     binaries against a number of specific test cases.  Normally these
     checks are only run in maintainer mode, but can be enabled and
     disabled with this option.

'--disable-compress-manpages'
     Compress manual pages with 'gzip -9' or 'bzip2 -9' or leave them
     uncompressed.  The default is to compress manual pages with 'gzip
     -9' or 'bzip2 -9' if a single compressed manual page exists in the
     target installation directory ('--mandir').  This disables
     automatic compression.

'--disable-public'
     Disable public release.  This option is not usable on public
     releases and only has a usable effect on OpenSS7 when the package
     is acquired from CVS. In particular, the 'STREAMS
     SS7/VoIP/ISDN/SIGTRAN Stacks' ('strss7-0.9a.8') release package has
     a large number of non-public components.  Specifying this option
     will cause the package to build and install all private release
     components in addition to the public release components.  This
     option affects all release packages.  Most release packages do not
     have private release components.

'--disable-initscripts'
     Disables the installation of 'init' scripts.  The default is to
     configure and install 'init' scripts and their associated
     configuration files.

     Although the default is to install 'init' scripts, installation
     attempts to detect a System V 'init' script configuration, and if
     one is not found, the 'init' scripts are installed into the
     appropriate directories, but the symbolic links to the run level
     script directories are not generated and the script is not invoked.
     Therefore, it is safe to leave this option unchanged, even on
     distributions that do not support System V 'init' script layout.

'--disable-32bit-libs'
     Disables the build and install of 32-bit compatibility libraries
     and test binaries on 64-bit systems that support 32-bit
     compatibility.  The default is to build and install 32-bit
     compatibility libraries and test binaries.  This option can be
     useful when configuring for an embedded target where only native
     shared libraries and binaries are desired.

'--disable-devel'
     Disables the installation of development environment components
     such as header files, static libraries, manual pages and
     'texinfo(1)' documentation.  The default is to install development
     environment components.  This option can be useful when configuring
     for an embedded target where only the run-time components are
     desired, or when performing a edit-compile-test cycle.

'--disable-docs'
     Disables the build and installation of major documentation such
     manual pages and 'texinfo(1)' documentation.  The default is to
     build and install documentation.  This option can be useful when
     building for an embedded target where only the run-time and static
     compile components are desired, but not major documentation.  This
     option does not override the setting of '--disable-devel'.

'--enable-distribute-docs'
     Enables the distribution of pre-built documentation.  Distribution
     of pre-built documentation in the distribution tarball causes the
     tarball size to increase dramatically.  To avoid this, the
     distribution of pre-built documentation was suppressed, by default,
     to reduce the size of the distribution tarball.  Enabling this
     feature causes pre-built documentation to be included in the
     distribution tarball.  The default is to disable the distribution
     of pre-built documentation.

'--disable-tools'
     Specifies whether user space programs and libraries are to be built
     and installed.  The default is to build and install user space
     programs and libraries.  This option can be useful when rebuilding
     for multiple architectures and target kernels, particularly under
     'rpm(8)' or 'dpkg(1)'.  The 'rebuild' 'automake(1)' target uses
     this feature when rebuilding RPMs for all available architectures
     and kernels, to rebuild user packages once per architecture instead
     of once per kernel.

'--disable-modules'
     Specifies whether kernel modules are to be built and installed.
     The default is to build and install kernel modules.  This option
     can be useful when rebuilding for multiple architectures and target
     kernels, particularly under 'rpm(8)' or 'dpkg(1)'.  The 'rebuild'
     'automake(1)' target uses this feature to rebuild for all available
     architectures and kernels.

'--disable-arch'
     Specifies whether architectural dependent package components are to
     be built and installed.  This option can be useful when rebuilding
     for multiple architectures and target kernels, particularly under

     architecture dependent package components.

'--disable-indep'
     Specifies whether architecture independent package components are
     to be built and installed.  This option can be useful when

     particularly under 'dpkg(1)'.  The default is to configure, build
     and install architecture independent package components.

'--enable-k-inline'
     Enable kernel inline functions.  Most Linux kernels build without
     '-finline-functions'.  This option adds the '-finline-functions'
     and '-Winline' flags to the compilation of kernel modules.  Use
     with care.

'--enable-k-safe'
     Enable kernel module run-time safety checks.  Specifies whether
     kernel safety is to be performed.  This option is mutually
     exclusive with '--enable-k-test', '--enable-k-debug' and
     '--enable-k-none' below.  This has the effect of invoking some more
     pedantic assertion macros in the code.  The default is not to apply
     kernel safety.

'--enable-k-test'
     Enable kernel module run-time testing.  Specifies whether kernel
     testing is to be performed.  This option is mutually exclusive with
     '--enable-k-safe' above and '--enable-k-debug' and
     '--enable-k-none' below.  This has the effect of removing 'static'
     and 'inline' attributes from functions and invoking most
     non-performance affecting debugging macros in the code.  The
     default is not to perform kernel testing.

'--enable-k-debug'
     Enable kernel module run-time debugging.  Specifies whether kernel
     debugging is to be performed.  This option is mutually exclusive
     with '--enable-k-safe' and '--enable-k-test' above, and
     '--enable-k-none' below.  This has the effect of removing 'static'
     and 'inline' attributes from functions and invoking all debugging
     macros in the code (including performance-affecting debug macros).
     The default is to not perform kernel debugging.

'--enable-k-none'
     Enable no kernel module run-time checks.  Specifies whether kernel
     run-time checks are to be performed.  This option is mutually
     exclusive with '--enable-k-safe', '--enable-k-test' and
     '--enable-k-debug'.  This has the effect of removing all assertion
     macros from the code.  The default is to not to remove all
     assertion macros.

     source pacakges is disabled by default.

'--enable-devfs'
'--disable-devfs'
     Specifies whether the build is for a device file system daemon
     enabled system with autoloading, or not.  The default is to build
     for 'devfsd(8)' autoloading when CONFIG_DEVFS_FS is defined in the
     target kernel.  The 'reuild' 'automake(1)' target uses this option
     to signal to the RPM spec file that the 'dev' subpackage need not
     be built.  This option has no effect for release packages that do
     not provide devices.

'--with-gpg-user=GNUPGUSER'
     Specify the 'gpg(1)' (*note (*manpages*)gpg(1)::) 'GNUPGUSER' for
     signing RPMs and tarballs.  The default is the content of the
     environment variable GNUPGUSER.  If unspecified, the 'gpg(1)'
     program will normally use the user name of the account invoking the
     'gpg(1)' program.  For building source RPMs, the RPM macro
     '_gpg_name' will override this setting.

'--with-gpg-home=GNUPGHOME'
     Specify the 'GNUPGHOME' directory for signing RPMs and tarballs.
     The default is the user's '~/.gpg' directory.  For building source

     'rpm(8)' nor 'dpkg(1)' packages, it applies to the tarball release
     as a whole.  The default is the contents of the '.pkgrelease' file
     in the release package source directory or, if that file does not
     exist, one (1).  This is the number after the last point in the
     package version number.

'--with-pkg-patchlevel=PATCHLEVEL'
     Specifies the patch level for the package.  This is neither used
     for 'rpm(8)' nor 'dpkg(1)' packages, it applies to the tarball
     release as a whole.  The default is the contents of the
     '.pkgpatchlevel' file in the release package source directory or,
     if that file does not exist, the null string.  This is an
     additional suffix after the package release in the package version
     number.  It is intended for bug fix releases or release candidates.

'--with-pkg-distdir=DIR'
     Specifies the distribution directory for the package.  This is used
     by the maintainer for building distribution repositories.  This is
     the directory into which binary packages are copied for

     of the RPM distribution.

'--with-rpm-topdir=PACKAGE_RPMTOPDIR'
     Specify the 'PACKAGE_RPMTOPDIR' top directory for RPMs.  If
     specified with a null 'PACKAGE_RPMTOPDIR', the default directory

     which the build is targeted.  When not cross compiling, if this
     option is not set, the build will be targeted at the kernel running
     in the build environment (e.g., 'uname -r').  When cross-compiling
     this option must be specified or the configure script will generate
     an error and terminate.

     SNMP support cannot be included in the run-time.

     Otherwise, specifies the SNMP agent header file directory,
     'SNMP-AGENT-HEADERS'.  The default is '$INCLUDEDIR' and the
     'configure' script will search for this directory.  The directory
     is normally located by the 'configure' script and need only be
     provided for special cross-build environments or when requested by
     a 'configure' script error message.

'--with-perl-headers HEADERS'
     Normally 'configure' can find the perl headers necessary for
     generating SNMP agents based on NET-SNMP. This option may be used
     to direct 'configure' to the location of the perl headers.  The
     default is '$INCLUDEDIR/perl'.

'--with-snmp=SNMP-HEADERS'
'--without-snmp'
     Normally 'configure' can find the NET-SNMP headers necessary for
     generating SNMP argents based on NET-SNMP. This option may be used
     to direct 'configure' to the location of the NET-SNMP headers,
     'SNMP-HEADERS'.  The default is '$INCLUDEDIR/ucd-snmp'.  The
     directory is normally located by the 'configure' script and need
     only be provided for special cross-build environments or when
     requested by a 'configure' script error message.

'--disable-java'
     Disable JAVA modules.  The package contains JAVA modules that can
     only be built the the appropriate tool chain.  The 'configure'
     script can normally detect and recommend missing JAVA components
     that are needed to generate JAVA modules and documentation.  This
     option should only be used on a system that does not support JAVA
     or when directed by a 'configure' script error message.  The

     environments or when requested by a 'configure' script error
     message.  This option has no effect on release packages that do not
     contain PERL interfaces.

'--disable-bestzip'
'--enable-bestzip'
     Disable best compression of archives.  The 'configure' script
     normally detects the available tools and determines what the best
     compression (highest compression ratio) is to compress 'tar(1)'
     archives.  It will typically use '.bz2' and '.xz' formats on
     current distributions but may fall back to '.gz' and '.bz2'
     compression on older distributions.  The default is to enable the
     best compression of archives.

'--with-lzma=LZMA_CMD'
'--without-lzma'
     Specifies the creation of 'lzma' archives.  'LZMA_CMD' specifies
     the compression command to use (typically 'lzma').  The typical use
     of is command is to specify '--without-lzma' to suppress the rather
     slow 'lzma' compression for test compilations.  The default is to
     create 'lzma' archives when a suitable command can be found or was
     specified and no 'xz' archive capability is provided.

     Unfortunately, 'automake(1)' does not detect the presence of the
     necessary tools to build 'lzma' archives, breaking distribution on
     systems that do not have 'lzma' tools.  This option tells
     'configure' to configure distribution to include 'lzma' archives.
     As the generation of 'lzma' takes a significant amount of time,
     generation of 'lzma' archives is disabled by default.

'--with-xz=XZ_CMD'
'--without-xz'
     Specifies the creation of 'xz' archives.  'XZ_CMD' specifies the
     compression command to use (typically 'xz').  The typical use of is
     command is to specify '--without-xz' to suppress the rather slow
     'lzma' compression for test compilations.  The default is to create
     'xz' archives when a suitable command can be found or was
     specified.

     Unfortunately, 'automake(1)' does not detect the presence of the
     necessary tools to build 'xz' archives, breaking distribution on
     systems that do not have 'xz' tools.  This option tells 'configure'
     to configure distribution to include 'xz' archives.  As the
     generation of 'xz' takes a significant amount of time, generation
     of 'xz' archives is disabled by default.

'--disable-repo-tar'
'--enable-repo-tar'
     Disable building of 'tar(1)' repositories.  Normally 'configure'
     can determine whether there are sufficient tools to create 'tar(1)'
     repositories.  This option explicitly disables or enables
     generation of 'tar(1)' repositories.  Normally in maintainer mode,
     'tar(1)' repositories will be constructed.  This option is normally
     used to disable the construction of 'tar(1)' repositories.

'--disable-rpms'
'--enable-rpms'
     Disable building of RPMs.  Normally 'configure' can determine
     whether it is possible to build RPMs on the current system and
     automatically determines whether to build RPMs as part of the
     'release' makefile target.  This option explicitly disables or
     enables building of RPMs.  The default is to auotmatically
     determine whether RPMs should be built.  This option is only
     enabled automatically when a suitable 'rpm(8)' command can be
     located.  A typical use of this option is to disable rpms with
     '--disable-rpms' on a 'Debian' system that yet provides the
     'rpm(8)' commands.

'--disable-srpms'
'--enable-srpms'
     Disable building of SRPMs.  Normally 'configure' can determine
     whether it is possible to build SRPMs on the current system and
     automatically determines whether to build SRPMs as part of the
     'release' makefile target.  This option explicitly disables or
     enables building of SRPMs.  The default is to automatically
     determine whether SRPMs should be built.  This option is only
     enabled automatically when a suitable 'rpm(8)' command can be
     located.  A typical use of this option is to disable rpms with
     '--disable-srpms' on a 'Debian' system that yet provides the
     'rpm(8)' commands.

'--disable-repo-yum'
'--enable-repo-yum'
     Disable building of 'yum(8)' repositories.  Normally 'configure'
     can determine whether there are sufficient tools to create 'yum(8)'
     repositories.  This option explicitly disables or enables
     generation of 'yum(8)' repositories.

'--with-install-source-yum=REPODIR'
'--without-install-source-yum'
     Specifies the 'yum(8)' repository directory, 'REPODIR'.  Creates
     and installs an installation source for the 'yum(8)' package
     management tool.  The default is to search for the appropriate
     directory.

'--disable-repo-yast'
'--enable-repo-yast'
     Disable building of 'yast(8)' repositories.  Normally 'configure'
     can determine whether there are sufficient tools to create
     'yast(8)' repositories.  This option explicitly disables or enables
     generation of 'yast(8)' repositories.

'--with-install-source-zypp=REPODIR'
'--without-install-source-zypp'
     Specifies the 'zypper(8)' repository directory, 'REPODIR'.  Creates
     and installs an installation source for the 'zypper(8)' package
     management tool.  The default is to search for the appropriate
     directory.

'--disable-debs'
'--enable-debs'
     Disable building of DEBs.  Normally 'configure' can determine
     whether it is possible to build DEBs on the current system and
     automatically determines whether to build DEBs as part of the
     'release' makefile target.  This option explicitly disables or
     enable building of DEBs.

'--disable-dscs'
'--enable-dscs'
     Disable building of DSCs.  Normally 'configure' can determine
     whether it is possible to build DSCs on the current system and
     automatically determines whether to build DSCs as part of the
     'release' makefile target.  This option explicitly disables or
     enable building of DSCs.

'--disable-repo-apt'
'--enable-repo-apt'
     Disable building of 'apt-get(1)' repositories.  Normally
     'configure' can determine whether there are sufficient tools to
     create 'apt-get(1)' repositories.  This option explicitly disables
     or enables generation of 'apt-get(1)' repositories.

'--with-install-source-apt=SOURCESDIR'
'--without-install-source-apt'
     Specifies the 'apt(1)' sources directory, 'SOURCESDIR'.  Creates
     and installs an installation source for the 'aptitude(8)' package
     management tool.  The default is to search for the appropriate
     directory.

The following 'configure' options, specific to the OpenSS7, are
available:

'--disable-streams-irq'
     Disables STREAMS irq suppression.  Normally the STREAMS scheduler
     protects itself and its datastructures from races due to hard
     interrupts by suppressing interrupts during critical sections.  As
     not all drivers and modules contain hard interrupts, this option
     allows hard interrupts to be enabled while running critical
     sections.  The purpose of this option was primarily for profiling.
     The default is to enable STREAMS irq suppression.

'--disable-streams-stats'
     Disable STREAMS statistics counting.  Normally the STREAMS
     scheduler will automatically count the number of entries to open,
     close, put and service procedures for a queue pair whenever the
     'module_stats' structure is defined and attached to the 'qinit'
     structure by the module or driver.  This is not exact SVR4.2 MP
     behaviour (where it is the responsibility of the module or drive to
     perform these counts).  This option disables the feature.  The
     default is to enable STREAMS statistics counting.

'--disable-streams-syncqs'
     Disable STREAMS synchronization queues.  Normally the STREAMS
     scheduler will permit modules and drivers that are written for
     syncrhonization (such as SVR4.2 MP synchronization, Solaris
     perimeters, etc.)  and will perform synchronization protection for
     these modules.  This option disables synchronization queues.  When
     disabled, only fully multiprocessor safe drivers and modules
     (marked with the D_MP flag), will be loaded.  The default is to
     enable STREAMS synchronization queues.

'--disable-streams-utils'
     Disable additional STREAMS utilities.  Normally 'strsetup' and
     'strload' utility configuration files are included in the build and
     installed.  This option disables build and installation of the
     'strsetup' and 'strload' configuration files.  The default is to
     enable additional STREAMS utilities.

'--disable-big-compile'
     Disable compilation as one big computational unit.  The default is
     to build as one big computational unit.  Do not use this option.

'--enable-streams-fifos'
     Enable overriding of system FIFOs with STREAMS-based FIFOs.  The
     default is to not override system FIFOs with STREAMS-based FIFOs.

'--with-streams-kthreads'
     Set STREAMS kernel thread operation to NICE, NORMAL, RT or NO.
     When set to NICE, the STREAMS scheduler will be based on kernel
     threads that run with a 'nice -19' priority.  When set to NORMAL,
     the STREAMS scheduler sill be based on kernel threas thar run with
     'nice -0' priority.  When set to RT, the STREAMS scheduler will be
     based on kernel threads that run with real-time priority 'nice
     -99'.  When set to NO, soft-interrupts will be used for the STREAMS
     scheduler rather than kernel threads.  This option was primarily
     for performance testing.  Do no use this option.  The default
     STREAMS kernel thread pirority is NICE.

'--enable-module-sth'
'--disable-module-sth'
     Enables or disables the 'sth' (Stream head) module.  When enabled,
     the 'sth' module will be compiled into the 'streams' kernel module;
     when disabled, the 'sth' module will not be included at all.  Note

     The default is for the 'sth' module to be created as a separate
     module.

'--enable-module-srvmod'
'--disable-module-srvmod'
     Enables or disables the 'srvmod' module.  When enabled, the
     'srvmod' module will be compiled into the 'streams' kernel module;

     module to be created as a separate module.

'--disable-xti-servtype'
     Disables XTI service type checks in the XTI/TLI Library.  Normally,
     the XTI/TLI Library will check for the service type of the endpoint
     and will reject commands that are not defined for the corresponding
     service type.  When enabled, this option causes the XTI/TLI Library
     to simply issue the corresponding primitive to the underlying
     driver and to allow the driver to determine whether the primitive
     is supported.  The default is for the XTI/TLI Library to check for
     XTI service type.

'--disable-xti-states'
     Disables XTI state checks in the XTI/TLI Library.  Normally the
     XTI/TLI Library will check for the state of the endpoint and will
     reject commands that would place the interface out of state.  When
     enabled, this option causes the XTI/TLI Library to simply issue the
     corresponding primitive to the underlying driver and to allow the
     driver to determine whether the interface is out of state.  The
     default is for the XTI/TLI Library to check for XTI state.

'--enable-sctp-slow-verification'
     Enable slow verification of addresses and tags.  When a message
     comes from an SCTP endpoint with the correct verification tag, it
     is not necessary to check whether it is from a correct source
     address to identify the SCTP association to which it belongs.  When
     you disable this feature ('--disable-sctp-slow-verification'),
     source addresses are not checked and it is up to firewall
     implementations to thwart attackers of the verification tag.  When
     you enable this feature ('--enable-sctp-slow-verification'), you
     get RFC 2960 compliant operation, but at great cost to SCTP
     performance.  This option defaults to 'disabled'.

'--enable-sctp-throttle-heartbeats'
     Enable heartbeat throttling.  Special feature of OpenSS7 that is
     not mentioned in RFC 2960.  When you enable this feature
     ('--enable-sctp-throttle-heartbeats'), OpenSS7 will throttle the
     rate at which it responds to heartbeats to the system control
     HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL.  This makes SCTP more resilient to
     implementations which flood heartbeat messages.  For RFC 2960
     compliant operation, disable this feature
     ('--disable-sctp-throttle-heartbeats').  This option defaults to
     'disabled'.

'--enable-sctp-discard-ootb'
     Enable discard of out-of-the-blue packets.  RFC 2960 requires the
     implementation to send 'ABORT' to some OOTB packets (packets for
     which no SCTP association exists).  Sending 'ABORT' chunks to
     unverified source addresses with the T bit set opens SCTP to blind
     masquerade attacks.  Not sending them may lead to delays at the
     peer endpoint aborting associations where our 'ABORT' has been lost
     and the socket is already closed or if we have restarted and the
     peer still has open associations to us.  If you enable this feature
     ('--enable-sctp-discard-ootb'), SCTP will discard all OOTB packets.
     This is necessary if another SCTP stack is being run on the same
     machine.  Therefore, if the OpenSS7 package is included on an
     OpenSS7 SCTP kernel, this feature is automatically enabled.  For
     RFC 2960 compliant operation, disable this feature
     ('--disable-sctp-discard-ootb').  This option defaults to
     'disabled' for non-OpenSS7 SCTP kernels, and 'enabled' for OpenSS7
     SCTP kernels.

'--enable-sctp-extended-ip-support'
     Enable extended IP support for SCTP. This provides extended IP
     support for SCTP for things like IP Transparent Proxy and IP
     Masquerading.  This is experimental stuff.  If in doubt, disable
     this feature ('--disable-sctp-extended-ip-support').  This option
     defaults to 'disabled'.

'--disable-sctp-hmac-sha1'
     Disable SHA-1 HMAC. This provides the ability to use the FIPS 180-1
     (SHA-1) message authentication code in SCTP cookies.  If you enable
     this feature ('--enable-sctp-hmac-sha1'), when the appropriate
     sysctl is set, SCTP will use the SHA-1 HMAC when signing cookies in
     the 'INIT-ACK' chunk.  If disable this feature
     ('--disable-sctp-hmac-sha1'), the SHA-1 HMAC will be unavailable
     for use with SCTP. This option defaults to 'enabled' on big-endian
     architectures, and 'disabled' otherwise.

'--disable-sctp-hmac-md5'
     Disable MD5 HMAC. This provides the ability to use the MD5 (RFC
     1321) message authentication code in SCTP cookies.  If you enable
     this feature ('--enable-sctp-hmac-md5'), when the appropriate
     sysctl is set, SCTP will use the MD5 HMAC when signing cookies in
     the INIT ACK chunk.  If you disable this feature
     ('--disable-sctp-hmac-md5'), the MD5 HMAC will be unavailable for
     use with SCTP. This option defaults to 'enabled' on little-endian
     architectures, and 'disabled' otherwise.

'--enable-sctp-adler32'
     Enable Adler32 checksum.  This provides the ability to use the
     older RFC 2960 Adler32 checksum.  If CONFIG_SCTP_CRC_32 below is
     not selected, the Adler32 checksum is always provided.  This option
     defaults to 'disabled'.

'--disable-sctp-crc32c'
     Disable CRC-32C checksum.  This provides the ability to use the
     newer CRC-32c checksum as described in RFC 3309.  When this is
     selected and CONFIG_SCTP_ADLER_32 is not selected above, then the
     only checksum that will be used is the CRC-32c checksum.  This
     option defaults to 'enabled'.

'--enable-sctp-throttle-passiveopens'
     Enable throttling of passive opens.  Special feature of Linux SCTP
     not mentioned in RFC 2960.  When secure algorithms are used for
     signing cookies, the implementation becomes vulnerable to INIT and
     'COOKIE-ECHO' flooding.  If you enable this feature
     ('--enable-sctp-throttle-passiveopens'), SCTP will only allow one
     INIT and one 'COOKIE-ECHO' to be processed in each interval
     corresponding to the sysctl sctp_throttle_itvl.  Setting
     sctp_throttle_itvl to 0 defeats this function.  If you disable this
     feature ('--disable-sctp-throttle-passiveopens'), each INIT and
     'COOKIE-ECHO' will be processed.  This option defaults to
     'disabled'.

'--disable-sctp-ecn'
     Enable explicit congestion notification.  This enables support for
     Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) chunks in SCTP messages as
     defined in RFC 2960 and RFC 3168.  It also adds syctl
     (/proc/net/ipv4/sctp_ecn) which allows ECN for SCTP to be disabled
     at runtime.  This option defaults to 'enabled'.

'--disable-sctp-lifetimes'
     Enable SCTP message lifetimes.  This enables support for message
     lifetimes as described in RFC 2960.  When enabled, message
     lifetimes can be set on messages.  See sctp(7).  This feature is
     always enabled when Partial Reliability Support is set.  This
     option defaults to 'enabled'.

'--disable-sctp-add-ip'
     Enable ADD-IP. This enables support for ADD-IP as described in
     draft-ietf-tsvwg-addip-sctp-07.txt.  This allows the addition and
     removal of IP addresses from existing connections.  This is
     experimental stuff.  This option defaults to 'enabled'.

'--disable-sctp-adaptation-layer-info'
     Enable ALI. This enables support for the Adaptation Layer
     Information parameter described in
     draft-ietf-tsvwg-addip-sctp-07.txt for communicating application
     layer information bits at initialization.  This is experimental
     stuff.  This option defaults to 'enabled'.

'--disable-sctp-partial-reliability'
     Enable SCTP Partial Reliability (PR-SCTP). This enables support for
     PR-SCTP as described in draft-stewart-tsvwg-prsctp-03.txt.  This
     allows for partial reliability of message delivery on a "timed
     reliability" basis.  This is experimental stuff.  This option
     defaults to 'enabled'.

'--disable-sctp-error-generator'
     Disable the SCTP error generator.  This provides an internal error
     generator that can be accessed with socket options for testing SCTP
     operation under packet loss.  You will need this option to run some
     of the test programs distributed with the SCTP module.  This option
     defaults to 'enabled'.

'--without-ip'
     Remove the second generation IP driver from the build.  The default
     is to include the second generation IP driver in the build.

'--without-udp'
     Remove the second generation UDP driver from the build.  The
     default is to include the second generation UDP driver in the
     build.

'--without-raw'
     Remove the second generation RAWIP driver from the build.  The
     default is to include the second generation RAWIP driver in the
     build.

'--without-tcp'
     Remove the second generation TCP driver from the build.  The
     default is to include the second generation TCP driver in the
     build.

'--with-sctp'
     Enable the version 1 driver in the build.  This option defaults to
     'disabled'.

'--without-sctp2'
     Enable the Release 2 driver in the build.  This option defaults to
     'enabled'.

7.3.5.3 Build
.............

To build from the tar ball, *note Building from the Tar Ball::.

7.4 Building
============

The 'OpenSS7' can be built from source RPM, Debian DSC, or tarball.  Any
of these approaches requires access to source code.  Note, however, that
you must be entitled to receive source code to be able to build using
any of these techniques.  'OpenSS7' does not normally permit access to
source code beginning with the 1.1.1 release.  Only sponsors of the
'OpenSS7 Project' and some clients of 'OpenSS7 Corporation' are
permitted access to source.

7.4.1 Building from the Source RPM
----------------------------------

If you have downloaded the necessary source RPM (*note Downloading the
Source RPM::), then the following instructions will rebuild the binary
RPMs on your system.  Once the binary RPMs are rebuilt, you may install
them as described above (*note Installing the Binary RPM::).

The source RPM is rebuilt to binary RPMs as follows:

     % wget https://www.openss7.org/repo/rpms/SRPMS/openss7-1.1.7.20150115-1.src.rpm
     % rpmbuild --rebuild -vv openss7-1.1.7.20150115-1.src.rpm

The rebuild process can also recognize a number of options that can be
used to tweak the resulting binaries, *note Configuring the Source
RPM::.  These options are provided on the 'rpm(8)' command line.  For
example:

     % rpmbuild --rebuild -vv --target athlon-redhat-linux \
       --define "_kversion 3.17.6-1-ARCH" \
       -- openss7-1.1.7.20150115-1.src.rpm

will rebuild binary RPM for the '3.17.6-1-ARCH' kernel for the 'athlon'
architecture.  (1)

Installation
............

To install the resulting binary RPM, *note Installing the Binary RPM::.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note that the '_kversion' of '3.17.6-1-ARCH' is only an example.

7.4.2 Building from the Debian DSC
----------------------------------

If you have downloaded the necessary Debian DSC (*note Downloading the
Debian DSC::), then the following instructions will rebuild the binary
DEBs on your system.  Once the binary DEBs are rebuilt, you may install
them as described above (*note Installing the Debian DEB::).

The Debian DSC is rebuilt to binary DEBs as follows:

     % wget http://www.openss7.org/debian/openss7_1.1.7.20150115-0.dsc
     % wget http://www.openss7.org/debian/openss7_1.1.7.20150115-0.tar.gz
     % dpkg-buildpackage -v openss7_1.1.7.20150115-0.dsc

The rebuild process can also recognize a number of options that can be
used to tweak the resulting binaries, *note Configuring the Debian
DSC::.  These options are provided in the environment variable
BUILD_DPKGOPTIONS and have the same form as the options to 'configure',
*note Configuring the Tar Ball::.  For example:

     % BUILD_DEBOPTIONS='
             --with-k-release=3.17.6-1-ARCH
             --host=athlon-debian-linux-gnu'
       dpkg-buildpackage -v \
       openss7_1.1.7.20150115-0.dsc

will rebuild binary DEB for the '3.17.6-1-ARCH' kernel for the 'athlon'
architecture.  (1)

Installation
............

To install the resulting binary DEB, *note Installing the Debian DEB::.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note that the '_kversion' of '3.17.6-1-ARCH' is only an example.

7.4.3 Building from the Tar Ball
--------------------------------

If you have downloaded the tar ball (*note Downloading the Tar Ball::),
then the following instructions will rebuild the package on your system.
(Note that the build process does not required 'root' privilege.)

7.4.3.1 Native Build
....................

Following is an example of a native build against the running kernel:

     % ./configure
     % make
     % popd

7.4.3.2 Cross-Build
...................

Following is an example for a cross-build.  The kernel release version
must always be specified for a cross-build.(1)  If you are
cross-building, specify the root for the build with environment variable
DESTDIR.  The cross-compile host must also be specified if different
from the build host.  Either the compiler and other tools must be in the
usual places where GNU 'autoconf(1)' can find them, or they must be
specified with declarations such as 'CC=/usr/lib/ppc-linux/gcc' on the
'configure' command line.

     % wget https://www.openss7.org/repo/tarballs/openss7-1.1.7.20150115.tar.xz
     % tar -xJvf openss7-1.1.7.20150115.tar.xz
     % pushd openss7-1.1.7.20150115
     % ./configure DESTDIR="/some/other/root" \
     	--with-k-release=2.4.18 --host sparc-linux
     % make
     % popd

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Because it _is_ a cross-build, the kernel version on the build
machine is unlikely to be the kernel version of the target machine,
except by coincidence.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) For additional information on 'apt(8)', see 'apt(8)' (*note
(*manpages*)apt(8)::).

   (2) Note that 'aptitude(8)' (*note (*manpages*)aptitude(8)::) is not
always available on systems supporting APT-RPM.

7.5.5 Installing the Binary RPM
-------------------------------

If you have downloaded the necessary binary RPMs (*note Downloading the
Binary RPM::), or have rebuilt binary RPMs using the source RPM (*note
Building from the Source RPM::), then the following instructions will
install the RPMs on your system.  For additional information on
'rpm(8)', see 'rpm(8)' (*note (*manpages*)rpm(8)::).

     % pushd RPMS/i686
     % rpm -ihv openss7-*-1.1.7.20150115-1.i686.rpm

You must have the correct binary RPMs downloaded or built for this to be
successful.

Some of the packages are relocatable and can have final installation
directories altered with the '--relocate' option to 'rpm(8)', see
'rpm(8)' (*note (*manpages*)rpm(8)::).  For example, the following will
relocate the documentation and info directories:

     % pushd RPMS/i686
     % rpm -ihv \
             --relocate '/usr/share/doc=/usr/local/share/doc' \
             --relocate '/usr/share/info=/usr/local/share/info' \
             -- openss7-doc-1.1.7.20150115-1.i686.rpm

The previous example will install the 'openss7-doc' package by will
relocate the documentation an info directory contents to the
'/usr/local' version.

7.5.6 Installing the Debian DEB
-------------------------------

If you have downloaded the necessary Debian DEBs (*note Downloading the
Debian DEB::), or have rebuild binary DEBs using the Debian DSC (*note
Building from the Debian DSC::), then the following instructions will
install the DEBs on your system.  For additional information see
'dpkg(8)' (*note (*manpages*)dpkg(8)::).

     % pushd debian
     % dpkg -iv openss7-*_1.1.7.20150115-0_*.deb

You must have the correct '.deb' files downloaded or build for this to
be successful.(1)

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Depending on the release, and if you have used option
'--enable-maintainer-mode' to 'configure' and have generated DEBs with
'make release', you should be able to issue 'make install-debs' from the
build directory.

7.5.7 Installing the Tar Ball
-----------------------------

After the build process (*note Building from the Tar Ball::),
installation only requires execution of one of two 'automake(1)'
targets:

'make install'
     The 'install' 'automake(1)' target will install all the components
     of the package.  Root privilege is required to successfully invoke
     this target.

'make install-strip'
     The 'install-strip' 'automake(1)' target will install all the
     components of the package, but will strip unnecessary information
     out of the objects and compress manual pages.  Root privilege is
     required to successfully invoke this target.

7.6 Removing
============

7.6.1 Removing with YUM
-----------------------

'OpenSS7' repositories support 'yum(8)' (*note (*manpages*)yum(8)::) in

component being removed is the last kernel development component, the
remainder of the 'OpenSS7' development components will also be removed.

To remove just documentation components, use (one of):

     $> sudo urpme openss7-doc openss7-javadoc

Of course, you are welcome to use a GUI package manager, such as
'rpmdrake(8)'.

7.6.4 Removing with APT
-----------------------

7.6.5 Removing the Binary RPM
-----------------------------

To remove an installed version of the binary RPMs (whether obtained from
the OpenSS7 binary RPM releases, or whether created by the source RPM),
execute the following command:

     % rpm -evv $(rpm -qa '*openss7*') 2>&1 | tee erase.log

This should uninstall all installed 'OpenSS7' RPMs from your system.(1)
Note that this command may also be used for any system based on 'rpm(8)'
(*note (*manpages*)rpm(8)::) regardless of whether the RPMs where
installed using 'rpm(8)' (*note (*manpages*)rpm(8)::), 'yum(8)' (*note
(*manpages*)yum(8)::) or 'zypper(8)' (*note (*manpages*)zypper(8)::).

For more information see 'rpm(8)' (*note (*manpages*)rpm(8)::).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Depending on the release, and if you have used option
'--enable-maintainer-mode' to 'configure' and have generated RPMs with
'make release', you should be able to issue 'make uninstall-rpms' from
the build directory to remove all installed binary rpms belonging to the
build release.

7.6.6 Removing the Debian DEB
-----------------------------

To remove an installed version of the Debian DEB (whether obtained from
the OpenSS7 binary DEB releases, or whether created by the Debian DSC),
execute the following command:

     % dpkg -ev $(dpkg -l | grep '^openss7') 2>&1 | tee erase.log

This should uninstall all installed 'OpenSS7' DEBs from your system.(1)
Note that this command may also be used for any system based on
'dpkg(1)' (*note (*manpages*)dpkg(1)::) regardless of whether the DEBs
were installed using 'dpkg(1)' (*note (*manpages*)dpkg(1)::) or 'apt(8)'
(*note (*manpages*)apt(8)::).

For more information see 'dpkg(1)' (*note (*manpages*)dpkg(1)::).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Depending on the release, and if you have used option
'--enable-maintainer-mode' to 'configure' and have generated DEBs with
'make release', you should be able to issue 'make uninstall-debs' from
the build directory to remove all installed Debian debs belonging to the
build release.

7.6.7 Removing the Source RPM
-----------------------------

To remove all the installed binary RPM build from the source RPM, see
*note Removing the Binary RPM::.  Then simply remove the binary RPM
package files and source RPM file.  A command such as:

     % find / -name 'openss7-*.rpm' -type f -print0 | xargs --null rm -f

This should remove all 'OpenSS7' RPMs from your system.(1)

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Depending on the release, you might be able to issue 'make
remove-rpms' from the build directory.

7.6.8 Removing the Debian DSC
-----------------------------

To remove all the installed binary DEB build from the Debian DSC, see
*note Removing the Debian DEB::.  Then simply remove the binary DEB
package files and Debian DSC file.  A command such as:

     % find / \( -name 'openss7-*.deb' \
              -o -name 'openss7-*.dsc' \
              -o -name 'openss7-*.tar.* \
              \) -type f -print0 | xargs --null rm -f

This should remove all 'OpenSS7' DEBs, DSCs and TARs from your
system.(1)

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Depending on the release, you might be able to issue 'make
remove-debs' from the build directory.

7.6.9 Removing the Tar Ball
---------------------------

To remove a version installed from tar ball, change to the build
directory where the package was built and use the 'uninstall'
'automake(1)' target as follows:

     % cd /usr/src/openss7
     % make uninstall
     % cd ..
     % rm -fr openss7-1.1.7.20150115
     % rm -f openss7-1.1.7.20150115.tar.bz2
     % rm -f openss7-1.1.7.20150115.tar.xz

If you have inadvertently removed the build directory and, therefore, no
longer have a configured directory from which to execute 'make
uninstall', then perform all of the steps for configuration and
installation (*note Installing the Tar Ball::) except the final
installation and then perform the steps above.

7.7 Loading
===========

7.7.1 Normal Module Loading
---------------------------

When OpenSS7 installs, modules and drivers belonging to release packages
are normally configured for demand loading.  The 'install' and
'install-strip' 'automake(1)' targets will make the necessary changes to
the '/etc/modules.conf' file and place the modules in an appropriate
place in '/lib/modules/3.17.6-1-ARCH/openss7'.  The 'make install'
process should have copied the kernel module files 'streams-*.o' to the
directory '/lib/modules/3.17.6-1-ARCH/openss7'.  This means that to load
any of these modules, you can simply execute, for example, 'modprobe
stream-SOMEDRIVER'.(1)

7.7.1.1 Linux Fast-STREAMS Module Loading
.........................................

The 'openss7' demand load system supports both the old 'kerneld' and the
new 'kmod' mechanisms for demand loading kernel modules.

The convention for 'openss7' kernel loadable object files is:
   * Their name start with "streams-".
   * They are placed in '/lib/modules/3.17.6-1-ARCH/streams/', where
     '3.17.6-1-ARCH' is an example kernel version.

If your kernel has been built using the 'kerneld' daemon, then 'OpenSS7'
kernel modules will automatically load as soon as the STREAMS module is
pushed or the driver is opened.  The 'make install' process makes the
necessary changes to the '/etc/modules.conf' file.  After the install,
you will see lines like the following added to your '/etc/modules.conf'
file:

     prune modules.openss7
     if -f /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/modules.openss7
     include /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/modules.openss7
     endif

which will provide for demand loading of the modules if they have been
built and installed for the running kernel.  The '/lib/modules/$(uname
-r)/modules.openss7' file looks like this:

     alias char-major-245  streams-SOME_DRIVER
     alias char-major-246  streams-OTHER_DRIVER

Note that STREAMS modules are not listed in this file, but will be
loaded by name using 'kerneld' if available.

'Linux Fast-STREAMS' has a wider range of kernel module loading
mechanisms than previously provided.  For mechanisms used for kernel
module loading under 'Linux Fast-STREAMS', *Note About This Manual:
(STREAMS)Top.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note that the '_kversion' of '3.17.6-1-ARCH' is only an example.

7.8 Maintenance
===============

7.8.1 Makefile Targets
----------------------

'automake(1)' has many targets, not all of which are obvious to the
casual user.  In addition, 'OpenSS7' 'automake(1)' files have additional
rules added to make maintaining and releasing a package somewhat easier.
This list of targets provides some help with what targets can be
invoked, what they do, and what they hope to achieve.  The available
targets are as follows:

7.8.1.1 User Targets
....................

The following are normal targets intended to be invoked by installers of
the package.  They are concerned with compiling, checking the compile,
installing, checking the installation, and removing the package.

'[all]'
     This is also the default target.  It compiles the package and all
     release packages selected by 'configure'.  This is performed after
     configuring the source with 'configure'.  A 'Makefile' stub is
     provided so that if the package has not had 'autoreconf(1)' run
     (such as when checked out from CVS, the package will attempt to run
     'autoreconf -fiv'.

     All 'OpenSS7 Project' packages are configured without maintainer
     mode and without dependency tracking by default.  This speeds
     compilation of the package for one-time builds.  This also means
     that if you are developing using the source package
     (edit-compile-test cycle), changes made to source files will not
     cause the automatic rebuilding due to dependencies.  There are two
     ways to enable dependency tracking: specify
     '--enable-maintainer-mode' to 'configure'; or, specify
     '--enable-dependency-tracking' to 'configure'.  I use the former
     during my edit-compile-test cycle.

     This is a standard 'GNU' 'automake(1)' makefile target.  This
     target does not require root privilege.

'check'
     All 'OpenSS7 Project' release packages provide check scripts for
     the check target.  This step is performed after compiling the
     package and will run all of the 'check' programs against the
     compiled binaries.  Which checks are performed depends on whether
     '--enable-maintainer-mode' was specified to 'configure'.  If in
     maintainer mode, checks that assist with the release of the package
     will be run (such as checking that all manual pages load properly
     and that they have required sections.)  We recommend running the
     check stage before installing, because it catches problems that
     might keep the installed package from functioning properly.

     Another way to enable the greater set of checks, without invoking
     maintainer mode, is to specify '--enable-checks' to 'configure'.
     For more information, see *note Pre-installation Checks::.

     This is a standard 'GNU' 'automake(1)' makefile target, although
     the functions performed are customized for the 'OpenSS7 Project'.
     This target does not require root privilege.

'install'
'install-strip'
     The 'install' target installs the package by installing each
     release package.  This target also performs some actions similar to
     the pre- and post-install scripts used by packaging tools such as
     'rpm(8)' or 'dpkg(1)'.  The 'install-strip' target strips
     unnecessary symbols from executables and kernel modules before
     installing.

     This is a standard 'GNU' 'automake(1)' makefile target.  This
     target requires root privilege.

'installcheck'
     All 'OpenSS7 Project' packages provide test scripts for the
     'installcheck' target.  Test scripts are created and run using
     'autotest' (part of the 'autoconf(1)' package).  Which test suites
     are run and how extensive they are depends on whether
     '--enable-maintainer-mode' was specified to 'configure'.  When in
     maintainer mode, all test suites will be run.  When not in
     maintainer mode, only a few post-install checks will be performed,
     but the test suites themselves will be installed in
     '/usr/libexec/openss7'(1) for later use.

     This is a standard 'GNU' 'automake(1)' makefile target.  This
     target might require root privilege.  Tests requiring root
     privilege will be skipped when run as a regular user.  Tests
     requiring regular account privileges will be skipped when run as
     root.

'retest'
     To complement the 'installcheck' target above, all 'OpenSS7
     Project' packages provide the 'retest' target as a means to rerun
     failed conformance test suite test cases.  The 'retest' target is
     provided because some test cases in the test suites have delicate
     timing considerations that allow them to fail sporadically.
     Invoking this target will retest the failed cases until no cases
     that are not expected failures remain.

     This is an 'OpenSS7 Project' specific makefile target.  As with
     'installcheck', this target might require root privilege.  Tests
     requiring root privilege will be skipped when run as a regular
     user.  Tests requiring regular account privileges will be skipped
     when run as root.

'uninstall'
     This target will reverse the steps taken to install the package.
     This target also performs pre- and post- erase scripts used by
     packaging tools such as 'rpm' or 'dpkg'.  You need to have a
     configured build directory from which to execute this target,
     however, you do not need to have compiled any of the files in that
     build directory.(2)

     The 'uninstall' target unfortunately removes add-on packages in the
     same order in which they were installed.  This is not good for the
     'OpenSS7 Master Package', where the 'remove' target should be used
     instead.

     This is a standard 'GNU' 'automake(1)' makefile target.  This
     target requires root privilege.

'remove'
     This target is like 'uninstall' with the exception that it removes
     add-on packages in the reverse order that installation was
     performed.(3)

     This is an 'OpenSS7 Project' specific makefile target.  This target
     requires root privilege.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) '/usr/libexec/openss7' is just an example, the actual location is
'${libexecdir}/${PACKAGE}', which varies from distribution to
distribution (as some distributions such as Mandriva do not have a
libexec directory).

   (2) Therefore, it is possible to download the package, configure it,
and then uninstall it.  This is handy if you do not have the sources
used to build and install the package immediately available.

   (3) This is useful from the 'OpenSS7 Master Package'.

7.8.1.2 Maintainer Targets
..........................

The following targets are targets intended for use by maintainers of the
package, or those responsible for release and packaging of a derivative
work of the package.  Some of these targets are only effective when
maintainer mode has been invoked ('--enable-maintainer-mode' specified
to 'configure'.)

'dist'
     Creates a distribution package (tarball) in the top level build
     directory.  'OpenSS7 Project' packages distribute two archives: a
     'gzip tar' archive and a 'bzip tar' archive.  These archives will
     have the name 'openss7-1.1.7.20150115.tar.bz2' and
     'openss7-1.1.7.20150115.tar.xz'.

     This is a standard 'GNU' 'automake(1)' makefile target.  This
     target does not require root privilege.

'distcheck'
     This target is intended for use when releasing the package.  It
     creates the 'tar(1)' archives above and then unpacks the tarball in
     a source directory, configures in a separate build directory,
     compiles the package, installs the package in a separate install
     directory, tests the install package to ensure that some components
     work, and, finally, uses the unpacked source tree to build another
     tarball.  If you have added or removed files from the package, this
     is a good way to ensure that everything is still stable for
     release.

     This is a standard 'GNU' 'automake(1)' makefile target.  This
     target does not require root privilege.

7.8.1.3 Clean Targets
.....................

'mostlyclean'
     Cleans out most of the files from the compile stage.  This target
     is helpful if you have not enabled dependency tracking and need to
     recompile with changes.

     This is a standard 'GNU' 'automake(1)' makefile target.  This
     target does not require root privilege.

'clean'
     Cleans all the files from the build directory generated during the
     'make [all]' phase.  It does not, however, remove files from the
     directory left there from the 'configure' run.  Use the 'distclean'
     target to remove those too.

     This is a standard 'GNU' 'automake(1)' makefile target.  This
     target might require root privilege if the 'installcheck' target or
     the 'testsuite' was invoked with root privilege (leaving files
     belonging to root).

'distclean'
     This target cleans out the directories left behind by 'distcheck'
     and removes all the 'configure' and generated files from the build
     directory.  This will effectively remove all the files in the build
     directory, with the except of files that belong to you or some
     other process.

     This is a standard 'GNU' 'automake(1)' makefile target.  This
     target might require root privilege if the 'installcheck' target or
     the 'testsuite' was invoked with root privilege (leaving files
     belonging to root).

'maintainer-clean'
     This target not only removes files from the build directory, it
     removes generated files from the source directory as well.  Care
     should be taken when invoking this target, because it removes files
     generated by the maintainer and distributed with the archive that
     might require special tools to regenerate.  These special tools
     might only be available to the maintainer.(1)  It also means that
     you probably need a full blown Linux system to rebuild the package.
     For more information, see *note Downloading from CVS::.

     This is a standard 'GNU' 'automake(1)' makefile target.  This
     target might require root privilege if the 'installcheck' target or
     the 'testsuite' was invoked with root privilege (leaving files
     belonging to root).

'check-clean'
     This target removes log files left behind by the 'check' target.
     By default, the check scripts append to log files in the top level
     build directory.  This target can be used to clean out those log
     files before the next run.

     This is an 'OpenSS7 Project' specific makefile target.  This target
     does not require root privilege.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Theoretically this is true, however, the 'OpenSS7 Project' does
not use any maintainer programs that are not generally available (i.e.
open source).

7.8.1.4 Manual Page Targets
...........................

The following targets are used to build, install and uninstall just the
manual pages from the distribution.  These targets are good for creating
a distribution of just the manual pages.  When building atop multiple
packages, these targets recurse down through each package.

'mans'
     Build all of the manual pages.  This involves performing parameter
     substitution on manual pages and optionally cooking the manual
     pages if '--with-cooked-manpages' was requested during
     configuration.

'install-mans'
     Installs the manual pages under DESTDIR.  Specify DESTDIR to place
     the manual pages wherever you see fit.  If DESTDIR is not specified
     on the command line, the manual pages will be installed in the
     normal installation directory.

'uninstall-mans'
     Uninstalls the manual pages from DESTDIR.  Specify DESTDIR to
     indicate where to remove the manual pages from.  If DESTDIR is not
     specified on the command line, the manual pages will be removed
     from the normal installation directory.

7.8.1.5 Release Targets
.......................

The following are targets used to generate complete releases into the
package distribution directory.  These are good for unattended and NFS
builds, which is what I use them for.  Also, when building from atop
multiple packages, these targets also recurse down through each package.

'release'
     Build all of the things necessary to generate a release.  On an
     'rpm(8)' system this is the distribution archives, the source rpm,
     and the architecture dependent and architecture independent binary
     rpms.  All items are placed in the package distribution directory
     that can be specified with the '--with-pkg-distdir=DIR' option to
     'configure'.

     This is an 'OpenSS7 Project' specific makefile target.  This target
     does not require root privilege.

'forced-release'
     The 'release' target will not regenerate any files that already
     exist in the package distribution directory.  This forced target
     will.

     This is an 'OpenSS7 Project' specific makefile target.  This target
     does not require root privilege.

'release-sign'
     You will be prompted for a password, unless to specify it to make
     with the GNUPGPASS variable.  For unattended or non-interactive
     builds with signing, you can do that as: 'make GNUPGPASS=mypasswd
     release-sign'

     This is an 'OpenSS7 Project' specific makefile target.  This target
     does not require root privilege.

'forced-release-sign'
     The 'release-sign' target will not regenerate any files that
     already exist in the package distribution directory.  This forced
     target will.

     This is an 'OpenSS7 Project' specific makefile target.  This target
     does not require root privilege.

'release-clean'
     This target will remove all distribution files for the current
     package from the package distribution directory.

     This is an 'OpenSS7 Project' specific makefile target.  This target
     does not require root privilege.

7.8.1.6 Logging Targets
.......................

For convenience, to log the output of a number of targets to a file, log
targets are defined.  The log file itself is used as the target to make,
but make invokes the target minus a '.log' suffix.  So, for example, to
log the results of target 'foo', invoke the target 'foo.log'.  The only
target that this does not apply to is 'compile.log'.  When you invoke
the target 'compile.log' a simple 'automake(1)' is invoked and logged to
the file 'compile.log'.  The 'foo.log' rule applies to all other
targets.  This does not work for all targets, just a selected few.(1)
Following are the logging targets:

Common Logging Targets
......................

Common logging targets correspond to normal user 'automake(1)' makefile
targets as follows:

'compile.log'
     This is an 'OpenSS7 Project' specific makefile target, but it
     invokes the standard 'GNU' 'automake(1)' makefile target '[all]'.

'check.log'
     This is an 'OpenSS7 Project' specific makefile target, but it
     invokes the standard 'GNU' 'automake(1)' makefile target 'check'.

'install.log'
     This is an 'OpenSS7 Project' specific makefile target, but it
     invokes the standard 'GNU' 'automake(1)' makefile target 'install'.

'installcheck.log'
     This is an 'OpenSS7 Project' specific makefile target, but it
     invokes the standard 'GNU' 'automake(1)' makefile target
     'installcheck'.

'uninstall.log'
     This is an 'OpenSS7 Project' specific makefile target, but it
     invokes the standard 'GNU' 'automake(1)' makefile target
     'uninstall'.

'remove.log'
     This is an 'OpenSS7 Project' specific makefile target, that invokes
     the 'OpenSS7 Project' 'remove' target.

Maintainer Logging Targets
..........................

Maintainer logging targets correspond to maintainer mode 'automake(1)'
makefile targets as follows:

'dist.log'
     This is an 'OpenSS7 Project' specific makefile target, but it
     invokes the standard 'GNU' 'automake(1)' makefile target 'dist'.

'distcheck.log'
     This is an 'OpenSS7 Project' specific makefile target, but it
     invokes the standard 'GNU' 'automake(1)' makefile target
     'distcheck'.

'srpm.log'
     This is an 'OpenSS7 Project' specific makefile target, that invokes
     the 'OpenSS7 Project' 'srpm' target.

'rebuild.log'
     This is an 'OpenSS7 Project' specific makefile target, that invokes
     the 'OpenSS7 Project' 'rebuild' target.

'resign.log'
     This is an 'OpenSS7 Project' specific makefile target, that invokes
     the 'OpenSS7 Project' 'resign' target.

'release.log'
     This is an 'OpenSS7 Project' specific makefile target, that invokes
     the 'OpenSS7 Project' 'release' target.

'release-sign.log'
     This is an 'OpenSS7 Project' specific makefile target, that invokes
     the 'OpenSS7 Project' 'release-sign' target.

If you want to add one, simply add it to LOGGING_TARGETS in
'Makefile.am'.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note that because logging targets invoke a pipe, 'automake(1)'
does not return the correct return status (always returns success if the
'tee(1)' operation is successful).  Therefore, these targets should not
be invoked by scripts that need to use the return value from
'automake(1)'.

7.8.1.7 Problem Report Targets
..............................

To ease problem report generation, all logging targets will
automatically generate a problem report suitable for mailing in the file
'target.pr' for target 'target.log'.  This problem report file is in the
form of an email and can be sent using the included 'send-pr' script or
by invoking the 'send-pr' makefile target.

There are two additional problem report targets:

'pr'
     The 'pr' target is for independently generating a problem report
     outside of the build or installation process.  The target will
     automatically generate a problem report skeleton suitable for
     editing and mailing in the file 'problem.pr'.  This problem report
     file is in the form of an email and can be edited and sent
     directly, or sent using the included 'send-pr' script or by
     invoking the 'send-pr' target.

     This is an 'OpenSS7 Project' specific makefile target.  This target
     does not require root privilege.

'send-pr'
     The 'send-pr' target is for finalizing and mailing a problem report
     generated either inside or outside the build and installation
     process.  The target will automatically finalize and mail the
     'problem.pr' problem report if it has changed since the last time
     that 'send-pr' was invoked.

     This is an 'OpenSS7 Project' specific makefile target.  This target
     does not require root privilege (unless the problem report file was
     generated as root).

7.8.1.8 Release Archive Targets
...............................

The following targets are used to generate and clean distribution
archive and signature files.  Whereas the 'dist' target affects archives
in the top build directory, the 'release-archive' targets affects
archives in the package distribution directory (either the top build
directory or that specified with '--with-pkg-distdir=DIR' to
'configure').

You can change the directory to which packages are distributed by using
the '--with-pkg-distdir=DIR' option to 'configure'.  The default
directory is the top build directory.

'release-archives'
     This target creates the distribution archive files if they have not
     already been created.  This not only runs the 'dist' target, but
     also copies the files to the distribution directory, which, by
     default is the top build directory.

     The files generated are named:

     'openss7-1.1.7.20150115.tar.bz2' and
     'openss7-1.1.7.20150115.tar.xz'

     You can change this distribution directory with the
     '--with-pkg-distdir' option to 'configure'.  See './configure
     --help' for more details on options.

     This is an 'OpenSS7 Project' specific makefile target.  This target
     does not require root privilege.

'release-sign-archives'
     This target is like 'release-archives', except that it also signs
     the archives using a 'GPG' detached signature.  You will be
     prompted for a password unless you pass the GNUPGPASS variable to
     make.  For automated or unattended builds, pass the GNUPGPASS
     variable like so:

     'make GNUPGPASS=mypasswd release-sign-archives'

     Signature files will be named:

     'openss7-1.1.7.20150115.tar.bz2.asc' and
     'openss7-1.1.7.20150115.tar.xz.asc'

     These files will be moved to the package distribution directory
     with the plain text archives.

     This is an 'OpenSS7 Project' specific makefile target.  This target
     does not require root privilege.

'release-clean-archives'
     This target will clean the release archives and signature files
     from the package distribution directory.

     This is an 'OpenSS7 Project' specific makefile target.  This target
     does not require root privilege.

7.8.1.9 RPM Build Targets
.........................

On 'rpm(8)' systems, or systems sporting rpm packaging tools, the
following targets are used to generate 'rpm(8)' release packages.  The
epoch and release number can be controlled by the contents of the
'.rpmepoch' and '.rpmrelease' files, or with the
'--with-rpm-epoch=EPOCH' and '--with-rpm-release=RELEASE' options to
'configure'.  See 'configure --help' for more information on options.
We always use release number '1'.  You can use release numbers above
'1'.

'srpm'
     This target generates the source rpm for the package (without
     signing the source rpm).  The source rpm will be named:
     'openss7-1.1.7.20150115-1.srpm'.

     This is an 'OpenSS7 Project' specific makefile target.  This target
     does not require root privilege.

'rpms'
     This target is responsible for generating all of the package binary
     rpms for the architecture.  The binary rpms will be named:

     'openss7-*-1.1.7.20150115-1.*.rpm'

     where the stars indicate the subpackage and the architecture.  Both
     the architecture specific subpackages (binary objects) and the
     architecture independent ('.noarch') subpackages will be built
     unless the the former was disabled with the option
     '--disable-arch', or the later with the option '--disable-indep',
     passed to 'configure'.

     This is an 'OpenSS7 Project' specific makefile target.  This target
     does not require root privilege.

'sign'
'srpm-sign'
     These two targets are the same.  When invoked, they will add a
     signature to the source rpm file, provided that the file does not
     already have a signature.  You will be prompted for a password if a
     signature is required.  Automated or unattended builds can be
     achieved by using the 'emake' expect script, included in
     '${srcdir}/scripts/emake'.

     This is an 'OpenSS7 Project' specific makefile target.  This target
     does not require root privilege.

'rebuild'
     This target accepts searches out a list of kernel names from the
     '${DESTDIR}/lib/modules' directory and builds rpms for those
     kernels and for each of a set of architectures given in the
     AM_RPMTARGETS variable to make.  This is convenience target for
     building a group of rpms on a given build machine.

     This is an 'OpenSS7 Project' specific makefile target.  This target
     does not require root privilege.

'resign'
     This target will search out and sign, with a 'GPG' signature, the
     source rpm, and all of the binary rpms for this package that can be
     found in the package distribution directory.  This target will
     prompt for a 'GPG' password.  Automated or unattended builds can be
     achieved with the 'emake' expect script located here:
     '${srcdir}/scripts/emake'.

     This is an 'OpenSS7 Project' specific makefile target.  This target
     does not require root privilege.

7.8.1.10 Debian Build Targets
.............................

On Debian systems, or systems sporting Debian packaging tools, the
following targets are used to generate Debian release packages.  The
release number can be controlled by the contents of the '.debrelease'
file, or with the '--with-debrelease=RELEASENUMBER' option to
'configure'.  See 'configure --help' for more information on options.

'dsc'
     This target will build the Debian source change package ('.dsc'
     file).  We use release number '0' so that the entire tarball is
     included in the 'dsc' file.  You can use release number '1' for the
     same purposes.  Release numbers above '1' will not include the
     entire tarball.  The '.dsc' file will be named:
     'openss7_1.1.7.20150115-0.dsc'.

     This is an 'OpenSS7 Project' specific makefile target.  This target
     does not require root privilege.

'sigs'
     This target signs the '.deb' files.  You will be prompted for a
     password, unless to specify it to make with the GNUPGPASS variable.

     This is an 'OpenSS7 Project' specific makefile target.  This target
     does not require root privilege.

'debs'
     This target will build the Debian binary package ('.deb' file) from
     the '.dsc' created above.  (This target will also create the '.dsc'
     if it has not been created already.)  The subpackage '.deb' files
     will be named: 'openss7-*_1.1.7.20150115-0_*.deb', where the stars
     indicate the subpackage and the architecture.

     This is an 'OpenSS7 Project' specific makefile target.  This target
     does not require root privilege.

'csig'
     This target signs the '.dsc' file.  You will be prompted for a
     password, unless to specify it to make with the GNUPGPASS variable.

     This is an 'OpenSS7 Project' specific makefile target.  This target
     does not require root privilege.

7.8.1.11 Documentation Targets
..............................

On systems that have 'doxygen(1)' (*note (*manpages*)doxygen(1)::)
documentation tool, the following targets are used to generate doxygen
html documentation:

'doxy'
     This target generates 'doxygen(1)' (*note (*manpages*)doxygen(1)::)
     documentation from suitably marked sources.  File containing the
     necessary documentation marks are discovered automatically by
     'configure'.  Doxygen documentation can be generated bus is not
     distributed.  Documentation is cerated in the subdirectory
     'doc/html'.

8 Troubleshooting
*****************

8.1 Test Suites
===============

8.1.1 Pre-installation Checks
-----------------------------

Most 'OpenSS7' packages, including the 'OpenSS7' package, ship with
pre-installation checks integral to the build system.  Pre-installation
checks include check scripts that are shipped in the 'scripts'
subdirectory as well as specialized 'make' targets that perform the
checks.

When building and installing the package from "RPM" or "DEB" source
packages (*note Building from the Source RPM::; and *note Building from
the Debian DSC::), a fundamental set of post-compile, pre-installation
checks are performed prior to building binary packages.  This is
performed automatically and does not require any special actions on the
part of the user creating binary packages from source packages.

When building and installing the package from "tarball" (*note Building
from the Tar Ball::; and *note Installing the Tar Ball::), however,
pre-installation checks are only performed if specifically invoked by
the builder of the package.  Pre-installation checks are invoked after
building the package and before installing the package.
Pre-installation checks are performed by invoking the 'check' or
'check.log' target to 'make' when building the package, as shown in
*note Example 8.1: testsuite:ex0.

     % wget http://www.openss7.org/openss7-1.1.7.20150115.tar.bz2
     % tar -xjvf openss7-1.1.7.20150115.tar.bz2
     % pushd openss7-1.1.7.20150115
     % ./configure
     % make
     % make check  # <------- invoke pre-installation checks
     % popd

Example 8.1: _Invoking Pre-Installation Checks_

Pre-installation checks fall into two categories: "System Checks" and
"Maintenance Checks".

8.1.1.1 Pre-Installation System Checks
......................................

"System Checks" are post-compilation checks that can be performed before
installing the package that check to ensure that the compiled objects
function and will be successfully installed.  When the
'--enable-maintainer-mode' option has not been passed to 'configure',
only "System Checks" will be performed.

For example, the steps shown in *note Example 8.2: testsuite:ex1. will

8.1.1.2 Pre-Installation Maintenance Checks
...........................................

"Maintenance Checks" include all "System Checks", but also checks to
ensure that the kernel modules, applications programs, header files,
development tools, test programs, documentation, and manual pages
conform to "OpenSS7" standards.  When the '--enable-maintainer-mode'
option has been passed to 'configure', "Maintenance Checks" will be
performed.

For example, the steps shown in *note Example 8.3: testsuite:ex2. will
perform "Maintenance" checks.

     % wget http://www.openss7.org/openss7-1.1.7.20150115.tar.bz2
     % tar -xjvf openss7-1.1.7.20150115.tar.bz2
     % pushd openss7-1.1.7.20150115
     % ./configure --enable-maintainer-mode
     % make
     % make check  # <------ invokes Maintenance pre-installation checks
     % popd

Example 8.3: _Invoking Maintenance Checks_

8.1.1.3 Specific Pre-Installation Checks
........................................

A number of check scripts are provided in the 'scripts' subdirectory of
the distribution that perform both "System" and "Maintenance" checks.
These are as follows:

'check_commands'

     This check performs both "System" and "Maintenance" checks.

     When performing "System" tests, the following tests are performed:

     Unless cross-compiling, or unless a program is included in
     'AM_INSTALLCHECK_STD_OPTIONS_EXEMPT' every program in
     'bin_PROGRAMS', 'sbin_PROGRAMS', and 'libexec_PROGRAMS' is tested
     to ensure that the '--help', '--version', and '--copying' options
     are accepted.  When cross-compiling is is not possible to execute
     cross-compiled binaries, and these checks are skipped in that case.

     Script executables, on the other hand, can be executed on the build
     host, so, unless listed in 'AM_INSTALLCHECK_STD_OPTIONS_EXEMPT',
     every program in 'dist_bit_SCRIPTS', 'dist_sbin_SCRIPTS', and
     'pkglibexec_SCRIPTS' are tested to ensure that the '--help',
     '--version', and '--copying' options are accepted.

     When performing "Maintenance" tests, 'check_commands' also checks
     to ensure that a manual page exists in section 1 for every
     executable binary or script that will be installed from
     'bin_PROGRAMS' and 'dist_bin_SCRIPTS'.  It also checks to ensure
     that a manual page exists in section 8 for every executable binary
     or script that will be installed from 'sbin_PROGRAMS',
     'dist_sbin_SCRIPTS', 'libexec_PROGRAMS', and 'pkglibexec_SCRIPTS'.

'check_decls'

     This check only performs "Maintenance" checks.

     It collects the results from the 'check_libs', 'check_modules' and
     'check_headers' check scripts and tests to ensure every declaration
     of a function prototype or external variable contained in installed
     header files has a corresponding exported symbol from either a to
     be installed shared object library or a to be installed kernel
     module.  Declarations are exempted from this requirement if their
     identifiers have been explicitly added to the 'EXPOSED_SYMBOL'
     variable.  If 'WARN_EXCESS' is set to 'yes', then the check script
     will only warn when excess declarations exist (without a
     corresponding exported symbol); otherwise, the check script will
     generate an error and the check will fail.

'check_headers'

     This check only performs "Maintenance" checks.

     When performing "Maintenance" tests, it identifies all of the
     declarations included in to be installed header files.  It then
     checks to ensure that a manual page exists in sections 2, 3, 7 or
     9, as appropriate, for the type of declaration.  It also checks to
     see if a manual page source file exists in the source directory for
     a declaration that has not been included in the distribution.
     Function or prototype declarations that do not have a manual page
     in sections 2, 3, or 9 will cause the check to fail.  Other
     declarations ('variable', 'externvar', 'macro', 'enumerate',
     'enum', 'struct', 'union', 'typedef', 'member', etc.)  will only
     warn if a manual page does not exist, but will not fail the check.

'check_libs'

     This check only performs "Maintenance" checks.

     When performing "Maintenance" tests, it checks that each exported
     symbol in each to be installed shared object library has a manual
     page in section 3.  It also checks that each exported symbol has a
     'function', 'prototype' or 'externvar' declaration in the to be
     installed header files.  A missing declaration or manual page will
     cause this check to fail.

'check_mans'

     This check only performs "Maintenance" checks.

     When performing "Maintenance" tests, it checks that to be install
     manual pages can be formatted for display without any errors or
     warnings from the build host 'man' program.  It also checks that
     required headings exist for manual pages according to the section
     in which the manual page will be installed.  It warns if
     recommended headings are not included in the manual pages.  Because
     some "RPM" distributions have manual pages that might conflict with
     the package manual pages, this check script also checks for
     conflicts with installed manual pages on the build host.  This
     check script also checks to ensure that all to be installed manual
     pages are used in some fashion, that is, they have a declaration,
     or exported symbol, or are the name of a kernel module or STREAMS
     module or driver, possibly capitalized.

     Note that checking for conflicts with the build host should
     probably be included in the "System" checks (because "System"
     checks are performed before the source "RPM" '%install' scriptlet).

'check_modules'

     This check performs both "System" and "Maintenance" checks.

     When performing "System" tests, it checks each to be installed
     kernel module to ensure that all undefined symbols can be resolved
     to either the kernel or another module.  It also checks whether an
     exported or externally declared symbol conflicts with an exported
     or externally declared symbol present in the kernel or another
     module.(1)

     When performing "Maintenance" tests, this check script tests that
     each to be installed kernel module has a manual page in section 9
     and that each exported symbol that does not begin with an
     underscore, and that belongs to an exported function or exported
     variable, has a manual page in section 9.  It also checks to ensure
     that each exported symbol that does not begin with an underscore,
     and that belongs to an exported function or exported variable, has
     a 'function', 'prototype' or 'externvar' declaration in the to be
     installed header files.

'check_streams'

     This check performs only "Maintenance" checks.

     When performing "Maintenance" tests, it checks that for each
     configured "STREAMS" module or driver, or device node, that a
     manual page exists in section 4 or section 7 as appropriate.

The output of the pre-installation tests are fairly self explanatory.
Each check script saves some output to '_name_.log', where _name_ is the
name of the check script as listed above.  A summary of the results of
the test are display to standard output and can also be captured to the
'check.log' file if the 'check.log' target is used instead of the
'check' target to 'make'.

Because the check scripts proliferate '_name_.log' files throughout the
build directory, a 'make check-clean' 'make' target has be provided to
clean them out.  'make check-clean' should be run before each successive
run of 'make check'.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) This particular check has caught some name space pollution that
has occurred in the 2.6.11 kernel.

8.1.2 Post-installation Checks
------------------------------

Most OpenSS7 packages ship with a compatibility and conformance test
suite built using the 'autotest' capabilities of 'autoconf'.  These test
suites act as a wrapper for the compatibility and conformance test
programs that are shipped with the package.

Unlike the pre-installation checks, the post-installation checks are
always run complete.  The only check that post-installation test scripts
perform is to test whether they have been invoked with root privileges
or not.  When invoked as root, or as a plain user, some tests might be
skipped that require root privileges, or that require plain user
privileges, to complete successfully.

8.1.2.1 Running Test Suites
...........................

There are several ways of invoking the conformance test suites:

  1. The test suites can be run after installation of the package by
     invoking the 'make installcheck' or 'make installcheck.log' target.
     Some packages require that root privileges be acquired before
     invoking the package.

  2. The test suites can be run from the distribution subdirectory after
     installation of the package by invoking the 'testsuite' shell
     script directly.

  3. The test suites can be run standalone from the 'libexec'
     ('/usr/libexec') installation directory by invoking the 'testsuite'
     shell script directly.

Typical steps for invoking the test suites directly from 'make' are
shown in *note Example 8.4: testsuite:ex3.

     % wget http://www.openss7.org/openss7-1.1.7.20150115.tar.bz2
     % tar -xjvf openss7-1.1.7.20150115.tar.bz2
     % pushd openss7-1.1.7.20150115
     % ./configure
     % make
     % make check  # <------ invokes System pre-installation checks
     % make install
     % sudo make installcheck # <------- invokes post-installation tests
     % popd

Example 8.4: _Invoking System Checks_

When performing post-installation checks for the purposes of generating
a problem report, the checks should always be performed from the build
directory, either with 'make installcheck' or by invoking 'testsuite'
directly from the 'tests' subdirectory of the build directory.  This
ensures that all of the information known to 'configure' and pertinent
to the configuration of the system for which a test case failed, will be
collected in the resulting 'testsuite.log' file deposited upon test
suite failure in the 'tests' directory.  This 'testsuite.log' file can
then be attached as part of the problem report and provides rich details
to maintainers of the package.  See also *Note Problem Reports::, below.

Typical steps for invoking an installed 'testsuite' standalone are shown
in *note Example 8.5: testsuite:ex4.

     % [sudo] /usr/libexec/openss7/testsuite

Example 8.5: _Invoking 'testsuite' Directly_

When invoked directly, 'testsuite' will generate a 'testsuite.log' file
in the current directory, and a 'testsuite.dir' directory of failed
tests cases and debugging scripts.  For generating a problem report for
failed test cases, see *note Stand Alone Problem Reports::.

8.2 Problem Reports
===================

8.2.1 Problem Report Guidelines
-------------------------------

Problem reports in the following categories should include a log file as
indicated in the table below:

'./configure'
     A problem with the configuration process occurs that causes the
     './configure' command to fail.  The problem report must include the
     'config.log' file that was generated by 'configure'.

'make compile.log'
     A problem with the build process occurs that causes the 'make'
     command to fail.  Perform 'make clean' and then 'make compile.log'
     and attach the 'config.log' and 'compile.log' files to the problem
     report.

'make check.log'
     A problem occurs with the 'make check' target that causes it to
     fail.  Perform 'make check-clean check.log' and attach the
     'config.log', 'compile.log' and 'check.log' files to the problem
     report.

'sudo make install.log'
     A problem occurs with 'sudo make install' that causes it to fail.
     Perform 'sudo make uninstall' and 'sudo make install.log' and
     attach the 'config.log', 'compile.log', 'check.log', and
     'install.log' files to the problem report.

'[sudo] make installcheck.log'
     A problem occurs with the 'make installcheck' target that causes
     the test suite to fail.  Attach the resulting 'tests/testsuite.log'
     and 'installcheck.log' file to the problem report.  There is no
     need to attach the other files as they are included in
     'tests/testsuite.log'.

'[sudo] make uninstall.log'
     A problem occurs with the 'make uninstall' target that causes the
     test suite to fail.  Perform 'sudo make uninstall.log' and attach
     the 'config.log', 'compile.log', 'check.log', 'install.log',
     'installcheck.log', 'tests/testsuite.log' and 'uninstall.log' file
     to the problem report.

'[sudo] make remove.log'
     A problem occurs with the 'make remove' target that causes the test
     suite to fail.  Perform 'sudo make remove.log' and attach the
     'config.log', 'compile.log', 'check.log', 'install.log',
     'installcheck.log', 'tests/testsuite.log' and 'remove.log' file to
     the problem report.

For other problems that occur during the use of the 'OpenSS7' package,
please write a test case for the test suite that recreates the problem
if one does not yet exist and provide a test program patch with the
problem report.  Also include whatever log files are generated by the
kernel ('cmn_err(9)') or by the 'strerr(8)' or 'strace(1)' facilities
('strlog(9)').

8.2.2 Generating Problem Reports
--------------------------------

'The OpenSS7 Project' uses the 'GNU GNATS' system for problem reporting.
Although the 'send-pr' tool from the 'GNU GNATS' package can be used for
bug reporting to the project's 'GNATS' database using electronic mail,
it is not always convenient to download and install the 'GNATS' system
to gain access to the 'send-pr' tool.

Therefore, the 'OpenSS7' package provides the 'send-pr' shell script
that can be used for problem reporting.  The 'send-pr' shell script can
invoked directly and is a work-alike for the 'GNU' 'send-pr' tool.

The 'send-pr' tool takes the same flags and can be used in the same
fashion, however, whereas 'send-pr' is an interactive tool(1), 'send-pr'
is also able to perform batch processing.  Whereas 'send-pr' takes its
field information from local databases or from using the 'query-pr'
C-language program to query a remote database, the 'send-pr' tool has
the field database internal to the tool.

Problem reports can be generate using 'make', *Note Problem Report
Targets::.  An example of how simple it is to generate a problem report
is illustrated in *note Example 8.6: autopr:ex0.

     % make pr
     SEND-PR:
     SEND-PR: send-pr:  send-pr was invoked to generate an external report.  An
     SEND-PR: automated problem report has been created in the file named
     SEND-PR: 'problem.pr' in the current directory.  This problem report can
     SEND-PR: be sent to bugs@openss7.org by calling this script as
     SEND-PR: '/home/brian/os7/scripts/send-pr --file="problem.pr"'.
     SEND-PR:
     SEND-PR: It is possible to edit some of the fields before sending on the
     SEND-PR: problem report.  Please remember that there is NO WARRANTY.  See
     SEND-PR: the file 'COPYING' in the top level directory.
     SEND-PR:
     SEND-PR: Please do not send confidential information to the bug report
     SEND-PR: address.  Inspect the file 'problem.pr' for confidential
     SEND-PR: information before mailing.
     SEND-PR:
     % vim problem.pr  # <--- follow instructions at head of file
     % make send-pr

Example 8.6: _Invoking Problem Report Generation_

Using the 'make pr' target to generate a problem report has the
advantages that it will assemble any available '*.log' files in the
build directory and attach them to the problem report.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) 'send-pr' launches the user's EDITOR to edit the problem report
before submitting it.

8.2.3 Automatic Problem Reports
-------------------------------

The 'OpenSS7' package also provides a feature for automatic problem
report generation that meets the problem report submission guidelines
detailed in the preceding sections.

Whenever a logging makefile target (*note Logging Targets::) is invoked,
if the primary target fails, the 'send-pr' shell script is invoked to
automatically generate a problem report file suitable for the
corresponding target (as described above under *note Problem Report
Guidelines::).  An example is shown in *note Example 8.7: autopr:ex1.

     % make compile.log
     ...
     ...
     make[5]: *** [libXNSdrvs_a-ip.o] Error 1
     make[5]: Leaving directory `/u6/buildel4/strxns'
     make[4]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
     make[4]: Leaving directory `/u6/buildel4/strxns'
     make[3]: *** [all] Error 2
     make[3]: Leaving directory `/u6/buildel4/strxns'
     make[2]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
     make[2]: Leaving directory `/u6/buildel4'
     make[1]: *** [all] Error 2
     make[1]: Leaving directory `/u6/buildel4'
     SEND-PR:
     SEND-PR: send-pr:  Make target compile.log failed in the compile stage.  An
     SEND-PR: automated problem report has been created in the file named
     SEND-PR: 'problem.pr' in the current directory.  This problem report can
     SEND-PR: be sent to bugs@openss7.org by calling 'make send-pr'.
     SEND-PR:
     SEND-PR: It is possible to edit some of the fields before sending on the
     SEND-PR: problem report.  Please remember that there is NO WARRANTY.  See
     SEND-PR: the file 'COPYING' in the top level directory.
     SEND-PR:
     SEND-PR: Please do not send confidential information to the bug report
     SEND-PR: address.  Inspect the file 'problem.pr' for confidential
     SEND-PR: information before mailing.
     SEND-PR:
     % vim problem.pr  # <--- follow instructions at head of file
     % make send-pr

Example 8.7: _Problem Report from Failed Logging Target_

8.2.4 Stand Alone Problem Reports
---------------------------------

The 'OpenSS7' package installs the 'send-pr' script and its
configuration file 'send-pr.config' in '${libexecdir}/openss7' along
with the validation 'testsuite', see *Note Test Suites::.  As with the
'testsuite', this allows the 'send-pr' script to be used for problem
report generation on an installed system that does not have a build
directory.

An example of invoking the package 'testsuite' and then generating a
problem report for failed cases is shown in *note Example 8.8:
autopr:ex2.

     % [sudo] /usr/libexec/openss7/testsuite
     % # test cases failed...
     % /usr/libexec/openss7/send-pr
     SEND-PR:
     SEND-PR: send-pr:  send-pr was invoked to generate an external report.  An
     SEND-PR: automated problem report has been created in the file named
     SEND-PR: 'problem.pr' in the current directory.  This problem report can
     SEND-PR: be sent to bugs@openss7.org by calling this script as
     SEND-PR: '/usr/libexec/openss7/send-pr --file problem.pr'.
     SEND-PR:
     SEND-PR: It is possible to edit some of the fields before sending on the
     SEND-PR: problem report.  Please remember that there is NO WARRANTY.  See
     SEND-PR: the file 'COPYING' in the top level directory.
     SEND-PR:
     SEND-PR: Please do not send confidential information to the bug report
     SEND-PR: address.  Inspect the file 'problem.pr' for confidential
     SEND-PR: information before mailing.
     SEND-PR:
     % vim problem.pr  # <--- follow instructions at head of file
     % /usr/libexec/openss7/send-pr --file problem.pr

Example 8.8: _Invoking 'send-pr' Directly_

The advantage of the approach shown in the example is that the 'send-pr'
script is capable of collecting the 'testsuite.log' file and the failed
test cases and debugging scripts from the 'testsuite.dir' directory and
including them in the problem report, as well as all package pertinent
information from the installed 'send-pr.config'.

8.3 Known Problems
==================

'The OpenSS7 Project' does not ship software with known bugs.  All bugs
are unknown.

Verified behaviour is that behaviour that has been verified by
conformance test suites that are shipped with the 'OpenSS7' package.

Unverified behaviour may contain unknown bugs.

Please remember that there is *NO WARRANTY*.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the "with...Texts."  line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.

GNU Affero General Public License
=================================



                The GNU Affero General Public License.
                      Version 3, 19 November 2007

     Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
     license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
--------

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to
take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast, our
General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share
and change all versions of a program-to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if
you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
programs, and that you know you can do these things.

Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with
two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this
License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
modify the software.

A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvements
made in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread
use, become available for other developers to incorporate.  Many
developers of free software are heartened and encouraged by the
resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of software used on network
servers, this result may fail to come about.  The GNU General Public
License permits making a modified version and letting the public access
it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public.

The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure
that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the
community.  It requires the operator of a network server to provide the
source code of the modified version running there to the users of that
server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on a publicly
accessible server, gives the public access to the source code of the
modified version.

An older license, called the Affero General Public License and published
by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is a
different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
this license.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                         TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

     "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public
     License.

     "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other
     kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

     "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
     License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
     "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

     To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the
     work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the
     making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified
     version" of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

     A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work
     based on the Program.

     To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
     permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
     infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on
     a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes
     copying, distribution (with or without modification), making
     available to the public, and in some countries other activities as
     well.

     To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
     parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user
     through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not
     conveying.

     An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
     to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
     feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
     tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to
     the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey
     the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this
     License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or
     options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this
     criterion.

  1. Source Code.

     The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
     for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
     form of a work.

     A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an
     official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in
     the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming
     language, one that is widely used among developers working in that
     language.

     The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything,
     other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal
     form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that
     Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with
     that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for
     which an implementation is available to the public in source code
     form.  A "Major Component", in this context, means a major
     essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the
     specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work
     runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code
     interpreter used to run it.

     The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
     the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
     work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts
     to control those activities.  However, it does not include the
     work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally
     available free programs which are used unmodified in performing
     those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example,
     Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated
     with source files for the work, and the source code for shared
     libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
     specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data
     communication or control flow between those subprograms and other
     parts of the work.

     The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
     regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
     Source.

     The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
     same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

     All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
     copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
     conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
     permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running
     a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given
     its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges
     your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by
     copyright law.

     You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
     convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise
     remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the
     sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you,
     or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided
     that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all
     material for which you do not control copyright.  Those thus making
     or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your
     behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit
     them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside
     their relationship with you.

     Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
     the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section
     10 makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

     No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
     measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under
     article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December
     1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of
     such measures.

     When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
     circumvention of technological measures to the extent such
     circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License
     with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to
     limit operation or modification of the work as a means of
     enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal
     rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

     You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
     receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
     appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
     keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
     non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
     code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
     give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

     You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
     and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

     You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
     produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
     terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
     conditions:

       a. The work must carry prominent notices stating that you
          modified it, and giving a relevant date.

       b. The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
          released under this License and any conditions added under
          section 7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in
          section 4 to "keep intact all notices".

       c. You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
          License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
          License will therefore apply, along with any applicable
          section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all
          its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.  This License
          gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but
          it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately
          received it.

       d. If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
          Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has
          interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal
          Notices, your work need not make them do so.

     A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
     works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered
     work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger
     program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is
     called an "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting
     copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the
     compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
     Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this
     License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

     You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
     of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
     machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this
     License, in one of these ways:

       a. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
          Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
          customarily used for software interchange.

       b. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
          written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
          long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that
          product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
          either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the
          software in the product that is covered by this License, on a
          durable physical medium customarily used for software
          interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of
          physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access
          to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no
          charge.

       c. Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
          written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
          alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially,
          and only if you received the object code with such an offer,
          in accord with subsection 6b.

       d. Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
          place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to
          the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same
          place at no further charge.  You need not require recipients
          to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code.
          If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the
          Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by
          you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying
          facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the
          object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.
          Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you
          remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as
          needed to satisfy these requirements.

       e. Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
          provided you inform other peers where the object code and
          Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the
          general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

     A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
     excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need
     not be included in conveying the object code work.

     A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means
     any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
     family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
     incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is
     a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of
     coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user,
     "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of
     product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the
     way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is
     expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product
     regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial,
     industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the
     only significant mode of use of the product.

     "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
     procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to
     install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that
     User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.
     The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
     functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or
     interfered with solely because modification has been made.

     If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,
     or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying
     occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession
     and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in
     perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction
     is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this
     section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But
     this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party
     retains the ability to install modified object code on the User
     Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

     The requirement to provide Installation Information does not
     include a requirement to continue to provide support service,
     warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed
     by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been
     modified or installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the
     modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation
     of the network or violates the rules and protocols for
     communication across the network.

     Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information
     provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is
     publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the
     public in source code form), and must require no special password
     or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

     "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of
     this License by making exceptions from one or more of its
     conditions.  Additional permissions that are applicable to the
     entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in
     this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable
     law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program,
     that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the
     entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to
     the additional permissions.

     When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
     remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part
     of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
     removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
     additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
     for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material
     you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright
     holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with
     terms:

       a. Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from
          the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

       b. Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices
          or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate
          Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

       c. Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,
          or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked
          in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

       d. Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors
          or authors of the material; or

       e. Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
          trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

       f. Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
          material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified
          versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to
          the recipient, for any liability that these contractual
          assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

     All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
     restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as
     you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that
     it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further
     restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document
     contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying
     under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed
     by the terms of that license document, provided that the further
     restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

     If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
     must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
     additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
     where to find the applicable terms.

     Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in
     the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
     the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

     You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
     provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
     modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
     under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the
     third paragraph of section 11).

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses
     for the same material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

     You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
     run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
     occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer
     transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require
     acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you
     permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions
     infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,
     by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your
     acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

     Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
     receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
     propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not
     responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this
     License.

     An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
     organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
     organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a
     covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
     transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
     licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or
     could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession
     of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in
     interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable
     efforts.

     You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
     rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you
     may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise
     of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate
     litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
     alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using,
     selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion
     of it.

  11. Patents.

     A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
     License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.
     The work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor
     version".

     A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
     owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
     hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner,
     permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its
     contributor version, but do not include claims that would be
     infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the
     contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, "control"
     includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner
     consistent with the requirements of this License.

     Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
     royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential
     patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and
     otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor
     version.

     In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any
     express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to
     enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a
     patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To "grant"
     such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or
     commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

     If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent
     license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available
     for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this
     License, through a publicly available network server or other
     readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the
     Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive
     yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular
     work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements
     of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream
     recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have actual knowledge
     that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work
     in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a
     country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
     country that you have reason to believe are valid.

     If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
     arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
     covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
     receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate,
     modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the
     patent license you grant is automatically extended to all
     recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

     A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
     the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
     conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that
     are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a
     covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third
     party that is in the business of distributing software, under which
     you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your
     activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party
     grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work
     from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with
     copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from
     those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific
     products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you
     entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted,
     prior to 28 March 2007.

     Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
     any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
     otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

     If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
     or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they
     do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you
     cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your
     obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
     then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example,
     if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for
     further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the
     only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would
     be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public
     License.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify
     the Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
     interacting with it remotely through a network (if your version
     supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the
     Corresponding Source of your version by providing access to the
     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge, through
     some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of
     software.  This Corresponding Source shall include the
     Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3 of the GNU
     General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
     following paragraph.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
     permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
     under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
     combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
     License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered
     work, but the work with which it is combined will remain governed
     by version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

     The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the GNU Affero General Public License from time to
     time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
     version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
     concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero
     General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version
     number of the GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any
     version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

     If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
     versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

     Later license versions may give you additional or different
     permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
     author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
     later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

     THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
     APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
     COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS"
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
     INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
     MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE
     RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
     SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
     NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

     IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES
     AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
     DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
     THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
     BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
     PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
     PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
     THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

     If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
     above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
     reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely
     approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in
     connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of
     liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
---------------------------------------------

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at
     your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     Affero General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
     along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If your software can interact with users remotely through a network, you
should also make sure that it provides a way for users to get its
source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive
of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
specific requirements.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  For more information on this, and how to apply and follow
the GNU AGPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
