* Major changes in strcompat-0.9.2.4-rc2

  Second release candidate.

* Major changes in strcompat-0.9.2.4rc1

  Release candidate for Mark Fugate.

* Major changes in strcompat-0.9.2.4

  Added --enable-devel configure option for embedded targets.
  Added send-pr script for automatic problem report generation.

* Major changes in strcompat-0.9.2.3

  This release is primarily to support additional compilers (gcc 4.0.2),
  architectures (x86_64, SMP, 32-bit compatibility), recent Linux
  distributions (EL4, SuSE 10, LE2006, OpenSuSE) and kernels (2.6.15).

  - Corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean compile and test runs on
    x86_64 architecture.  Some bug corrections resulting from gcc 4.0.2
    compiler warnings.

  - Changes to satisfy gcc 4.0.2 compiler.

  - Corrected build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15 kernels as reported on
    mailing list.

  - Corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean compile and test runs on
    x86_64 architecture.  Some bug corrections resulting from gcc 4.0.2
    compiler warnings.

  - Initial corrections for and testing of SMP operation on Intel 630
    Hyper-Threaded SMP on x86_64.  This package should now run well on
    N-way Xeons even with Hyper-Threading enabled.

  - Corrections and validation of 32-bit compatibilty over 64-bit on
    x86_64.  Should apply well to other 64-bit architectures as well.

  This is a public beta test release of the package.

* Major changes in strcompat-0.9.2.2

  This is primarily a bug fixes release and corrections resulting from
  testing.  This is a major bug fix release.  The previous release was
  largely untested.  This release has been verified (conformance test
  suite passes) for operation with `Linux Fast-STREAMS'
  (`streams-0.7a.4').

* Initial release strcompat-0.9.2.1

  Initial autoconf/RPM packaging of the `strcompat' release.

  This is the initial release of the `OpenSS7 STREAMS Compatibility'
  package for `Linux Fast-STREAMS' (and LiS).  These compatibility
  modules were formerly part of the `Linux Fast-STREAMS' package
  (`streams-0.7a.3'), however, as they were also applicable to `LiS',
  they have been removed into a separate package.  Once `Linux
  Fast-STREAMS' is production grade, these compatibility modules will be
  rolled back into the streams package as `LiS' becomes deprecated.
