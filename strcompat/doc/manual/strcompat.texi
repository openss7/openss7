@node Abstract
@unnumberedsec Abstract
@cindex document abstract

This document provides a @cite{@value{MANUAL_TYPE}} for @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}}.

@unnumberedsubsec Objective
@cindex document objective

The objective of this document is to provide a guide for the @dfn{STREAMS} programmer when
developing @dfn{STREAMS} modules, drivers and application programs for @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}}.

This guide provides information to developers on the use of the @dfn{STREAMS} mechanism at user and
kernel levels.

@dfn{STREAMS} was incorporated in UNIX System V Release 3 to augment the character input/output
(I/O) mechanism and to support development of communication services.

@dfn{STREAMS} provides developers with integral functions, a set of utility routines, and facilities
that expedite software design and implementation.

@unnumberedsubsec Intent
@cindex document intent

The intent of this document is to act as an introductory guide to the @dfn{STREAMS} programmer.  It
is intended to be read alone and is not intended to replace or supplement the
@cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} manual pages.  For a reference for writing code, the manual pages
(see @manref{STREAMS(9)}) provide a better reference to the programmer.
Although this describes the features of the @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package,
@uref{http://www.openss7.com/,OpenSS7 Corporation} is under no obligation to provide any software,
system or feature listed herein.

@unnumberedsubsec Audience
@cindex document audience

This document is intended for a highly technical audience.  The reader should already be familiar
with @cite{Linux} kernel programming, the @cite{Linux} file system, character devices, driver input
and output, interrupts, software interrupt handling, scheduling, process contexts, multiprocessor
locks, etc.

The guide is intended for network and systems programmers, who use the @dfn{STREAMS} mechanism at
user and kernel levels for @cite{Linux} and @cite{UNIX} system communication services.

Readers of the guide are expected to possess prior knowledge of the @cite{Linux} and @cite{UNIX}
system, programming, networking, and data communication.

* Rationale::
@end menu

The @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package is intended to provide maximum compatibility between
@cite{Linux STREAMS (LiS)} or @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS (LfS)} and other @dfn{STREAMS} implementations on
major UNIX operating systems, for the purpose of porting existing @dfn{STREAMS} modules and drivers from
those operating system to @dfn{Linux}.

Also, the @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package aims to provide compatibility between @cite{Linux
STREAMS (LiS)} and @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} to ease the porting of @dfn{STREAMS} modules and drivers from
@cite{LiS} to @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} with minimal effort.

To meet that objective, @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} aims to support the @dfn{STREAMS} DDI/DKI and
registration functions of the following @dfn{STREAMS} implementations:

@sp 1
@itemize
@item UNIX System V Release 3.2
@item UNIX System V Release 4 MP
@item UNIX System V Release 4.0 MP
@item UNIX System V Release 4.2 MP
@item Mentat Portable Streams (MPS)
@item Linux STREAMS LiS 2.16
@item Linux STREAMS LiS 2.18
@item Linux Fast-STREAMS 0.7a.3
@item AIX 5L Version 5.1 Portable STREAMS Environment (PSE)
@item HP-UX 11.0i v2 STREAMS/UX
@item OSF/1.2 - Digital UNIX STREAMS
@item UnixWare 7.1.3 (OpenUnix 8) STREAMS
@item Solaris 9/SunOS 5.9 (OpenSolaris) STREAMS
@item Mac OS 9 OpenTransport 1.5r2
@item IRIX 6.5.17 STREAMS
@item SUPER-UX Release 9.2
@item UXP/V V10L10 STREAMS V10
@end itemize

@sp 1
Because it is not necessary to have all of these compatibility modules loaded at a given time, and
to reduce the footprint of the resulting kernel modules, the @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package
implements these compatiblity modules as separate demand loadable @dfn{Linux} kernel modules.

The @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package contains compatibility modules that were originally part of
the @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} package.  They have been separated into an package independent from
@cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} for the purpose of provide some of the same capabilities to @cite{Linux
STREAMS (LiS)} in advance of production releases of @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS}.

@page
@node Rationale
@section Rationale
@cindex rationale

The @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package is designed and implemented to be compatible with as many
@cite{SVR 4.2 MP} based implementations of @dfn{STREAMS}a s possible.  This is done for several
reasons:

@enumerate
@item Porting legacy drivers to @dfn{Linux}:

Many legacy @dfn{STREAMS} drivers have been written and developed for @cite{SVR 4.2 MP} or
@dfn{UNIX} systems based on @cite{SVR 4.2 MP}.  Remaining compatible with as many implementations as
possible permits these legacy drivers to be easily ported from their native @dfn{UNIX} variant to
the @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} environment, thus quickly porting these legacy drivers to @dfn{Linux}.

@item Leverage of knowledge base:

Many developers are familiar with one or another of the mainstream @dfn{UNIX} implementations of
@cite{SVR 4.2 MP STREAMS}.  By remaining as compatibile as possible with all these implementations
of @dfn{STREAMS} permits knowledge and expertise in the @dfn{UNIX} variant of @dfn{STREAMS} to be
transferred and applied to @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} on @dfn{Linux}.

@item Reverse portability:

Because it is compatible as possible with other @dfn{STREAMS} implementations, @dfn{STREAMS} drivers
and modules developed on @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} can easily be ported to other implementations if
a set of compatiblity and portability guidelines are followed.  This allows @dfn{STREAMS} driver and
modules developed on the @dfn{Linux} operating system to be used on branded @dfn{UNIX} systems with
minimal porting and modification.

@item Multiple baselines:

Because the source code developed for @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} can remain quite close to that for
other maintstream @dfn{UNIX} implementations of @cite{SVR 4.2 MP STREAMS}, it is possible to have
multiple baselines for different architectures in the same source code files.  This eases the
maintenance of @dfn{STREAMS} drivers and modules across @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} and other
@dfn{UNIX} systems.

@item Standardization:

By being as compatible as possible with many @dfn{STREAMS} implementations as possible, @cite{Linux
Fast-STREAMS} implements an ipso facto standard.  Unfortunately, the @url{http://www.opengroup.org/,
OpenGroup} and @cite{POSIX} have been very lacking in the standardization of internal kernel
interfaces such as @dfn{STREAMS}.  Maximum compatibility moves close to providing a standard for
such interfaces.

@item Licensing and Technology Binding

By implementing an ipso facto standard, independent @dfn{STREAMS} drivers and modules written to the
technical interface avoid being impinged upon by the GNU Public License under which @cite{Linux
STREAMS} and @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} are distributed.

@subsubheading Notes:

@itemize --
@item @command{canenable(9)} is really an @cite{SVR 3.2} compatibility function that should not be
used with @cite{SVR 4} @dfn{STREAMS} programs.

@item For the most part, the @cite{UNIX System V Release 4.0 STREAMS} functions are universally
implemented.  Exceptions to this include @command{backq(9)}, which appears to be an oversight on the
part of @cite{SUPER-UX} documentation; @command{esbbcall(9)}, that can be emulated by calling
@command{bufcall(9)} with a size of zero; @command{getadmin(9)}, @command{getmid(9)} and
@command{strlog(9)}, which seems to be more of a @cite{Solaris} and @cite{LiS} problem;
@command{SAMESTR(9)}, which is only useful on systems with @dfn{STREAMS} support for pipes and
FIFOs.

@item @cite{LiS} always misses what @cite{Solaris} misses.  That is probably not a coincidence.

@item For specific compatibility notes, see the individual manual pages for these functions.
@end itemize

Because all of these functions are supported by the core @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS} package, and all
but @command{getadmin(9)}, @command{getmid(9)} and @command{strlog(9)} are supported by the core
@cite{Linux STREAMS (LiS)} package, these functions are not provided in the @cite{SVR 4.2
Compatibility Module}, @file{streams_svr4compat.ko}.  The three functions missing from @cite{LiS}
are implemented in the @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS Compatibility Module}, @file{streams_lfscompat.ko},
that is only built and installed against @cite{LiS}.

in the various implementations with which this package is compatible.  @cite{Linux Fast-STREAMS}
implements most of these functions in the core @file{streams.ko} kernel module.  The
@command{MPSTR_*} locking functions are part of the @cite{SVR 4.2 MP} compatibility module,
@file{streams_svr4compat.ko} because they only have documented support in @cite{UnixWare}.

@item @command{MPSTR_STPRELE(9)} @tab -- unlock a STREAMS stream head from exclusive access
@end multitable

@subsubheading Notes:

@itemize --
@item Although they are @dfn{STREAMS} functions, nobody other than @cite{UnixWare} mentions the
@command{MPSTR_*} functions, so they are placed in the @cite{SVR 4.2 MP} compatibility module,
@file{streams_svr4compat}.

@item The @command{pcmsg(9)} function seems to have been missed by a number of implementations.

@item @cite{LiS} always misses what @cite{Solaris} misses.  That is probably not a coincidence.

@item @cite{Lis} did not have anything resembling a proper @command{qprocson(9)} or
@command{qprocsoff(9)} implementation until recently.  @cite{LiS} did not have any
@command{freezestr(9)} or @command{unfreezestr(9)} implementation until recently.  Neither
implementations are fully functional or in accordance with @dfn{STREAMS} documentation, making them
almost unusable.

@item @cite{AIX}, @cite{OSF/1} and @cite{UXP/V} do not document any of these functions, which is
bad: these are the MP functions for @dfn{STREAMS}.

@node Mentat Portable Streams (MPS) Utility Functions
@subsubsection Mentat Portable Streams (MPS) Utility Functions

The @cite{Mentat Portable Streams (MPS)} utility functions are important because they exist on many
@cite{UNIX} systems.  @cite{AIX}, @cite{HP-UX}, @cite{OSF/1.2} and @cite{Mac OpenTransport} are
based on @cite{MPS}.  Almost all variants use the @cite{Mentat} TCP/IP implementations, and
therefore have implementations of many of these functions internally if not exposed.  @cite{AIX},
@cite{OSF/1.2} and especially @cite{Mac OpenTransport} expose and document most (if not all) of
these functions.   The @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package supports all of these functions.

implementations of some @dfn{UNIX} variants differ from the @cite{Mac OpenTransport} documentation
in name and prototype.
