.SH NAME
.B RW_UNLOCK
\- release a read/write lock
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #define _SVR4_SOURCE
.br
.B #include <sys/ksynch.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/ddi.h>
.HP
.BI "void RW_UNLOCK(rwlock_t *" lockp ", pl_t " pl );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I lockp
A pointer to the read/write lock to release.
.TP
.I pl
A priority level to set if required after releasing the lock.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR RW_ALLOC (9),
.BR RW_DEALLOC (9),
.BR RW_RDLOCK (9),
.BR RW_WRLOCK (9),
.BR RW_TRYRDLOCK (9),
.BR RW_TRYWRLOCK (9)
and
.BR RW_UNLOCK ()
are a set of primitive functions for allocating, deallocating, read locking,
write locking, read lock attempt, write lock attempt and unlocking a
read/write lock of type
.BR rwlock_t .
.PP
.BR RW_UNLOCK ()
releases the lock specified by the
.I lockp
argument and then restores the priority level specified by the
.I pl
argument.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR RW_UNLOCK ()
is normally called in the reverse order as any call to
.BR RW_RDLOCK (9)
or
.BR RW_WRLOCK (9),
or successful call to
.BR RW_TRYRDLOCK (9)
or
.BR RW_TRYWRLOCK (9).
.BR RW_UNLOCK ()
is normally called with the same priority level in the
.I pl
argument that was returned as a return value from a call to
.BR RW_RDLOCK (9)
or
.BR RW_WRLOCK (9),
or successful call to
.BR RW_TRYRDLOCK (9)
or
.BR RW_TRYWRLOCK (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR RW_UNLOCK ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR RW_UNLOCK ()
is always successful.  If
.BR RW_UNLOCK ()
is passed invalid or uninitialized arguments, or a
.I lockp
argument which has not been acquired by the calling context, then the results
are indeterminate.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR RW_UNLOCK ()
can be called from any context, provided that the context has previously
acquired the lock specified by
.I lockp
with
.BR RW_RDLOCK "(9), " RW_WRLOCK "(9), " RW_TRYRDLOCK "(9) or " RW_TRWRLOCK (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR RW_UNLOCK ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR RW_UNLOCK ()
is a
.IR "SVR 4.2" -specific
function:
.B _SVR4_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR4
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR4_MODULE
defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR RW_UNLOCK ()
is implemented by unlocking
.I lockp
with
.BR read_unlock (9)
and restoring the interrupt priority level
.I pl
with
.BR splx (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
The following is an example of the use of
.BR RW_UNLOCK ():
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fC\s-1\
pl_t pl;
rwlock_t *lockp;
lockp = RW_ALLOC(0, plstr, NULL, KM_SLEEP);
 ...
pl = RW_RDLOCK(lockp);
{
	/* manipulate read protected data */
	...
}
RW_UNLOCK(lockp, pl);
 ...
RW_DEALLOC(lockp);

.BR RW_WRLOCK (9),
.BR STREAMS (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR RW_UNLOCK ()
performs a
.BR read_unlock (9).
This might cause problems on some architectures that expect
.BR read_unlock (9)
or
.BR write_unlock (9)
depending on the state of the lock.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR RW_UNLOCK ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI"
.[
usldk
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR RW_UNLOCK ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for the purpose of porting
.IR "SVR 4.2"
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR "SVR 4.2"
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR RW_UNLOCK ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR RW_UNLOCK ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.

See
.BR STREAMS (9)
