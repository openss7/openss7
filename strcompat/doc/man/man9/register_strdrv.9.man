.HP
.BI "int register_strdrv(struct cdevsw *" cdev );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I cdev
a pointer to the
.I STREAMS
character device switch table entry,
.BR cdevsw (9),
to register.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR register_strdrv ()
registers the character device switch table entry,
.IR cdev ,
into the character device switch table.
.PP
Historically, under
.IR "SVR 4.2" ,
.[
svr42
.]
the character device switch table was a fixed-sized array indexed on major device number.  With
expanded major device number, a fixed-size array would be to consumptive of pinned memory.
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
uses a file system directory approach instead.
Under
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" ,
each
.I STREAMS
device driver is allocated a directory entry in the
.IR "STREAMS Special Shadow File System" ,
.BR specfs (5).
Special
.B inode
numbering is used in the
.BR specfs (5),
where the major component of the
.B inode
number is zero
.RB ( 0 ),
and the minor component of the
.B inode
number is the module id (internal major device number) of the driver.  Each registered
.I STREAMS
device driver has a directory
.B inode
in the
.BR specfs (5).
Lookups are performed by looking up an
.B inode
on the
.BR specfs (5)
by
.B inode
number.
See
.BR specfs (5)
for additional details.
.PP
The
.I cdev
entry must contain a
.I d_name
member and that member must be a unique name, different from any name already registered as a
.I STREAMS
driver.  If there already exists a
.I STREAMS
driver by the requested name, and the
.BR cdevsw (9)
entry does not already belong to
.IR cdev,
.BR register_strdrv ()
will fail with error
.RB [ EPERM ].
If the
.I STREAMS
driver is already registered,
.BR register_strdrv ()
will fail with error
.RB [ EBUSY ].
.PP
The
.I cdev
entry must also contain a
.I d_str
member that points to a valid allocated
.BR streamtab (9)
structure.  That
.BR streamtab (9)
structure must have a validly allocated
.I st_rdinit
member that points to a valid
.BR qinit (9)
structure that has a valid
.I qi_minfo
member that points to a valid
.BR module_info (9)
structure describing the
.I STREAMS
driver or module.
.PP
If the
.I mi_idnum
is non-zero,
.BR register_strdrv ()
will try to use the
.I mi_idnum
provided.
If the
.I mi_idnum
is non-zero,
.BR register_strdrv ()
will attempt to dynamically select a module id.
If
.BR register_strdrv ()
cannot dynamically select a module id (because all module ids are already used), it fails with error
.RB [ ENXIO ].
.PP
The
.I mi_idnum
is the \(lqindex\(rq into the character device switch table.
The
.I mi_idnum
also serves as the internal major device number.
.PP
If there is already another
.I STREAMS
driver registered to the requested
.IR mi_idnum ,
.BR register_strdrv ()
will fail with error
.RB [ EPERM ].
If the
.I STREAMS
driver is already registered to the requested
.IR mi_idnum ,
.BR register_strdrv ()
will fail with error
.RB [ EBUSY ].
.PP
Because
.BR register_strdrv ()
calls
.BR cdev_add (9)
internally to create a directory
.I inode
in the
.BR specfs (5),
it is possible that it can fail if the
.BR specfs (5)
file system is not loaded, or if the allocation of an
.B inode
fails due to lack of memory.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
This is probably not the function that you want.  See
.BR register_strdev (9).
.PP
.BR register_strdrv ()
is normally called from a
.I STREAMS
driver initialization routine
.RB ( __init "() or " module_init "() procedure)
to publish the driver to the
.I STREAMS
executive and the
.BR specfs (5)
file system, making the driver available to user space scripts and programs to
.BR open (2s)
the device driver via the
.BR specfs (5).
.PP
.BR unregister_strdrv (9)
is normally called from a
.I STREAMS
driver termination routine
.RB ( __exit "() or " module_exit "() procedure)
to remove the driver from the
.I STREAMS
executive and the
.BR specfs (5)
file system, making the driver no longer available to user space scripts and programs to
.BR open (2s)
the device driver via the
.BR specfs (5).
.PP
.BR unregister_strdrv (9)
is used to unregister a
.I STREAMS
device driver.
.I STREAMS
device drivers registered with
.BR register_strdrv ()
must be unregistered with
.BR unregister_strdrv (9),
using the same
.BR cdevsw (9)
structure,
.IR cdev ,
that was passed to
.BR register_strdrv ().
.PP
In general, the
.BR cdevsw (9)
structure that is passed to
.BR register_strdrv (),
and its associated
.I STREAMS
.BR streamtab (9)
structure and any file operations should be statically allocated within the driver or module.  These
structures can be dynamically allocated, however, in any event, they should not be manipulated
directly after they have been passed to
.BR register_strdrv ()
and before they are passed to
.BR unregister_strdrv (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR register_strdrv ()
returns a positive module id number.  This is either the requested module id number or a dynamically
allocated module id number if one was not specified.
Upon failure,
.BR register_strdrv ()
takes no action and returns a negative error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When an error occurs,
.BR register_strdrv ()
fails and returns a negative error number.
.BR register_strdrv ()
can fail under the following conditions:
.TP \w'[ENOMEM]\(em'u
.RB [ EINVAL ]
The
.I cdev
structure or its members are invalid or contain invalid information.  (See text.)
.TP
.RB [ EPERM ]
The
.I cdev->d_name
supplied is registered to another
.I STREAMS
driver.
.TP
.RB [ EPERM ]
The
.I cdev->d_str->st_rdinit->qi_minfo->mi_idnum
supplied is registered to another
.I STREAMS
driver.
.TP
.RB [ EBUSY ]
The
.I cdev->d_name
supplied is already registered to the
.I STREAMS
driver,
.IR cdev .
.TP
.RB [ EBUSY ]
The
.I cdev->d_str->st_rdinit->qi_minfo->mi_idnum
supplied is already registered to the
.I STREAMS
driver,
.IR cdev .
.TP
.RB [ ENXIO ]
The
.I cdev->d_str->st_rdinit->qi_minfo->mi_idnum
was specified as zero
.RB ( 0 )
an a new unique module id could not be dynamically allocated.
.PP
.BR register_strdrv ()
internally calls
.BR cdev_add (9)
and can fail with any of the errors returned by that function, including:
.TP \w'[ENOMEM]\(em'u
.RB [ ENODEV ]
The
.IR "Special Shadow File System" ,
.BR specfs (5),
is not loaded, so it is impossible to allocate a directory
.B inode
for the driver.
.TP
.RB [ ENOMEM ]
A directory
.B inode
cannot be allocated due to lack of memory.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR register_strdrv ()
can be called from any blocking context, including user context, kernel thread context, module
.IR qi_qopen (9)
and
.IR qi_qclose (9)
procedures, and some top level
.IR qi_putp (9)
procedures; however, it is only intended to be called from a driver or module
.BR __init ()
or
.BR moddule_init ()
procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR register_strdrv ()
is MP-safe, when called from the correct context.  The caller must ensure exclusive access to the
passed in
.BR cdevsw (9)
structure,
.IR cdev ,
and its associated linked structures.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.I STREAMS
device drivers registered with
.BR register_strdrv ()
in a driver or module initialization routine, must be unregistered with
.BR unregister_strdrv (9)
is a driver or module termination routine.
.PP
When
.I STREAMS
files are opened within the resulting
.BR specfs (5)
directory entry,
the
.I cdev->d_fop
member will be used for the file operations for the
.BR open (2s).
See
.BR cdevsw (9)
for details.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR register_strdrv ()
is an internal

.I STREAMS
drivers.
See

for a function that can be used directly by

drivers.
