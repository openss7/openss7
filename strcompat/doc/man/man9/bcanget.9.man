.SH NAME
.B bcanget
\- test for message arrival on a band on a stream
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
int \fBbcanget\fR(queue_t *\fIq\fR, int \fIband\fR);
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
The queue to test for message arrival.
.TP
.I band
The queue band within which to test for message arrival.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR bcanget ()
tests whether it is possible to retrieve messages from the specified
.I q
for the specified
.IR band .
That is,
.BR bcanget ()
tests whether there exists a message of band number
.I band
on the queue
.IR q .
.PP
.BR bcanget ()
is an internal interface used to support the
.B I_CKBAND
I/O control described under
.BR streamio (7),
and in support of the
.BR poll (2s)
system call.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR bcanget ()
returns true (non-zero) if there is a message waiting for retreival with
.BR getq (9)
within the band specified by
.IR band .
.BR bcanget ()
returns false (zero) if there is not message waiting within the
.IR band .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR bcanget ()
encounters an error, it fails and returns false (zero).
.BR bcanget ()
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR bcanget ()
can be called from any context.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR bcanget ()
is MP-safe.  The caller is responsible to determine whether the status of the
queue has changed since the last call to
.BR bcanget ().
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
Although this function is documented as an internal function of
.IR "SVR 4" ,
.[
svr4
.]
.BR bcanget ()
is not normally called directly by
.I STREAMS
modules or drivers.  It is not part of any DDI.
This function is normally internal to the
.I STREAMS
executive, yet,
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
provides an exported version of this function for use by module and drivers in
support of direct IO.
.PP
This function should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
modules or drivers.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR bcanget ()
is compatible with
.I LiS
.[

with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR bcanget ()
and the symbol
.BR lis_bcanget ()
are provided for compatibility with
.IR LiS .
.[
lis
.]
See
.BR lisbcm (8).
.BR lis_bcanget ()
simply calls
.BR bcanget ()
directly.
.IP \(em
.BR bcanget ()
should not be called by normal
.I STREAMS
module or drivers and is implementation specific.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.

See
.BR STREAMS (9)
