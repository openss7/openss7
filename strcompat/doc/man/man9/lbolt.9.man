.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B lbolt
of type
.B clock_t
is a
.IR "SVR 4.2" -specific
function:
.B _SVR4_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR4
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR4_MODULE
defined.
.PP
.B lbolt
of type
.B time_t
is an
.IR OSF/1 \(rg-specific
function:
.B _OSF_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_OSF
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_OSF_MODULE
defined.
.PP
.BR lbolt ()
of type
.B time_t
is a
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg-specific
function:
.B _SUX_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.

.SH COMPATIBILITY

.B lbolt
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI"
.[
usldk
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP" ,
including
.IR HP-UX \(rg,
.IR OSF/1 \(rg,
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg,
.IR UnixWare \(rg,
.IR UXP/V \(rg,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
Accessing
.B lbolt
directly has many compatibility and portability issues and should not be used
directly by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
The more common
.I SVR 4.2
.BR drv_getparm (9)
function should be used in its stead.
.IP \(em
.IR Solaris \(rg
uses the SUNDDI function
.BR ddi_get_lbolt ()
to access this value.
.IP \(em
.IR OSF/1 \(rg
declares
.BR lbolt
as a
.BR time_t .
.IR "SVR 4"
declares it as a
.BR clock_t .
.IP \(em
.I SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI

provides the function
.BR drv_getparm ()
to access the value of
.BR lbolt .
.IP \(em
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg
declares
.B lbolt
as a
.BR time_t ,
but provides it as a function call,
.BR lbolt (),
 instead of an external in-memory kernel
variable.
.IP \(em
.IR UnixWare \(rg
provides the
.BR TICKS ()
macros

for accessing
.BR lbolt .
.IR UnixWare \(rg

to be
.BR clock_t .

.B lbolt
of type
.B clock_t
is provided for source level compatibility with

for the purpose of porting

Because internal structures and definitions for
