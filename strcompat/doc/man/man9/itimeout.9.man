.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I timo_fcn
the function to call on expiry.
.TP
.I arg
the argument to pass to the callback function.
.TP
.I ticks
the number of ticks to wait before expiry.
.TP
.I pl
the priority level at which to run the callout function.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR itimeout ()
starts a timer with duration
.I ticks
number of system clock ticks, that,  upon expiry will invoke the supplied
timeout function callback
.I timo_fcn
(if the
.I timo_fcn
function pointer is
.RB non- NULL )
with the supplied argument
.IR arg ,
at the specified priority level
.IR pl .
The timeout callout function
.I timo_fcn
is a function returning
.B void
and taking a single
.B caddr_t
argument as follows:
.sp
.nf
.BI "typedef void timo_fcn_t(caddr_t " arg );
.fi
.PP
The callout function
.I timo_fcn
will be executed at some time greater than or equal to the interval specified
in the
.I ticks
argument at the specified priority level
.IR pl .
.PP
The
.B toid_t
timeout identifier returned by
.BR itimeout ()
is suitable to be used by 
.BR untimeout (9)
to cancel the timeout function callout.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR itimeout ()
returns a
.B toid_t
defined as follows:
.sp
.nf
.B typedef int toid_t;
.B typedef int timout_id_t;
.fi
.PP
Upon success,
.BR itimeout ()
returns a non-zero timeout id and the timeout is scheduled.
Upon failure,
.BR itimeout ()
returns a zero timeout id and no timeout is scheduled.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR itimeout ()
fails, it returns a zero (0) timeout id.
.BR itimeout ()
failes when it cannot allocate the internal structures for the timeout, when
the arguments are invalid, or the timeout cannot otherwise be scheduled at the
specified priority level.  If it is important that a timeout be scheduled with
assurance, the return value should always be checked.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR itimeout ()
can be called from any context including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR itimeout ()
is MP-safe.
.PP
Considerations should be given when writing the callback function that a
.BR itimeout ()
call-out function is asynchronous and can execute at the same time as any user
context, module procedure, call-out, callback, soft interrupt or interrupt
service routine not masked by the
.I pl
argument.
In addition, for sufficiently small
.I tick
values, the call-out function may execute before the call to
.BR itimeout ()
returns.
.PP
However, the callback function will be serviced by the same CPU as the CPU
from which the
.BR itimeout ()
was issued.  Therefore, the callback function will not execute until after
.BR itimeout ()
returns, no matter whether
.I ticks
is zero or negative.
Because the servicing thread and the current thread are the same, the
.BR itimeout ()
callback will not be invoked until after the function that called
.BR itimeout ()
returns.
This means that it is safe to store the returned timeout id in global
variables access by the callback function.
.PP
This is the same situation for
.BR qtimeout (9),
.BR qbufcall (9),
.BR timeout (9),
.BR bufcall (9)
and
.BR esbbcall (9)
functions.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
For architectural independence,
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules should not specify the
.I ticks
argument directly, but should use the
.BR drv_usectohz (9)
and
.BR drv_hztousec (9)
DKI functions.  The Linux
.B HZ
define or some other quantum independent conversion function to convert to and
from microseconds or some other absolute unit of time.
.PP
.B toid_t
and
.B timout_id_t
should be treated as an opaque type that can be tested for equality to zero.
The value should not otherwise be manipulated.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
implements timeout id values internally as a pointer to a
.B strevent
structure containing a Linux timer.  on 64-bit architectures,
.B strevent
structures are allocated in low or high memory only so that pointers can be
converted to integers and visa versa.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
also includes a version field in the least significant bits of the pointer to
handle late calls to
.BR untimeout (9).
