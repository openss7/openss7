.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR freezestr ()
freezes the state of the queue,
.IR q,
and the Stream containing
.IR q .
A frozen
Stream
blocks any thread attempting to enter any
.IR qi_qopen (9),
.IR qi_qclose (9),
.IR qi_putp (9),
or
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure belonging to any queue instance in the
Stream,
and blocks any thread currently within the
Stream
if it attempts to put messages onto or take messages off of any queue within the
Stream
(with the sole exception of the caller).  Threads blocked by this mechanism remain so until the
Stream
is thawed by a call to
.BR unfreezestr (9).
.PP
Freezing a
Stream
does not automatically stop all functions that are running within the
Stream;
functions will continue to run until they attempt to perform some operation that would change the
state of the
Stream,
at which point they will be forced to wait for the
Stream
to be unfrozen by a call to
.BR unfreezestr (9).
.PP
A queue cannot be altered while frozen.
The purpose of
.BR freezestr ()
is to lock the state of the
.I q
so that its members can be accessed directly.
.\".PP
.\".BR freezestr ()
.\"blocks entry to all queue procedures,
.\".IR qi_qopen (9)
.\".IR qi_qclose (9),
.\".IR qi_putp (9)
.\"and
.\".IR qi_srvp (9),

.\".BR qtimeout (9),
.\".BR qbufcall (9),
.\".BR qwriter (9),
.\".BR mi_bufcall (9),
.\".BR streams_put (9),
.\".BR weldq (9)
.\"and
.\".BR unweldq (9).
.\".PP
.\".BR freezestr ()
.\"waits until all other threads in
.\".IR qi_qopen (9),
.\".IR qi_qclose (9),
.\".IR qi_putp (9)
.\"and
.\".IR qi_srvp (9)
.\"procedures,
.\".BR qbufcall (9)
.\"and
.\".BR qtimeout (9)
.\"callback functions,
.\"and
.\".BR qwriter (9)
.\"callouts functions
.\"in the Stream containing
.\".I q
.\"exit.
.\".BR freezestr ()
.\"then locks the Stream so that all other threads will be blocked from entering
.\"those functions with the exception of the current thread.
.\".PP
.\"In addition, the queue specified by
.\".I q
.\"is locked and all other threads will be blocked from executing queue
.\"manipulation functions
.\".BR appq (9),
.\".\".BR bcanget (9),

.\".BR rmvq (9),
.\".BR setq (9),
.\".BR strqget (9)
.\"and
.\".BR strqset (9)
.\"for the locked queue and local interrupts will be suppressed.
.PP
A procedure that freezes a Stream queue with
.BR freezestr ()
must thaw the Stream queue with
.BR unfreezestr (9)
before returning.
.PP
A
Stream
must be frozen with
.BR freezestr ()
accross a call to
.BR insq (9),
.BR appq (9),
.BR rmvq (9),
.BR strqset (9),
.BR strqget (9).
See the manual pages for these utilities for an example of freezing the
Stream
across the call, and for the reasons why the
Stream
must be frozen.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR freezestr ()
is intended to be used from a
.I STREAMS
driver or module
.IR qi_qopen (9),
.IR qi_qclose (9),
.IR qi_putp (9),
or
.IR qi_srvp (9),
procedure to freeze the state of the
Stream
so that
.I STREAMS
utilities that directly alter the state of a queue within the
Stream
may be called, or direct searching or maniuplation of a queue can be performed, safely
in a Symetric Multi-Processor (SMP) environment.
.PP
Prior to 
.IR "SVR 4.1 MP" ,
the proper approach when performing similar functions was to bracket operations that manipulated or
searched queues with
.BR splstr (9)
and
.BR splx (9).
In the Uni-Processor (UP) environment, calling
.BR freezestr ()
has the same effect as calling
.BR splstr (9),
and calling
.BR unfreezestr (9)
has the same effect as calling
.BR splx (9).

.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR freezestr ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR freezestr ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures, callouts, callbacks, soft
interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR freezestr ()
is MP-safe; however,
the caller is responsible for the validity of the reference
.IR q .
References to
.I q
from a procedure, call-out or callback predicated on the queue pair to which
.I q
belongs are guaranteed valid.  The caller must guarantee validity from call outs, callbacks, soft
interrupts and interrupt service routines not predicated on the queue pair to which
.I q
belongs.
In general,
.I q
is valid from the moment that
.BR qprocson (9)
returns until the moment that
.BR qprocsoff (9)
is called.
.PP
Because
.BR freezestr ()
causes other processors executing threads within the
Stream
to spin when attempting to change
Stream
state, and because
.BR freezestr ()
disables local interrupts on the calling processor,
until
.BR unfreezestr (9)
is called, the period for which a driver or module freezes a Stream is critical and has an impact on
system performance.
The caller must not call any functions which may cause the calling thread to sleep while it holds a
frozen Stream.  Attempting to do so might panic the kernel.
.PP
In the Uni-Processor (UP) environment,
.BR splstr (9)
can be called instead of
.BR freezestr ().
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR freezestr ()
does not block entry to or synchronize with asynchornous callback functions generated by
.BR bufcall (9),
.BR esballoc (9),
.BR esbbcall (9),
or
.BR timeout (9).
.BR freezestr ()
does not block entry to synchronous callback functions generated by
.BR qbufcall (9),
.BR qtimeout (9),
.BR weldq (9),
.BR unweldq (9),
or
.BR qwriter (9).
.PP
.BR freezestr ()
does not affect the operation of
.BR qprocson (9)
and
.BR qprocsoff (9)
which are separate facilities.
.PP
Although calling
.BR freezestr ()
twice for the same queue will result in single-party deadlock of the calling processor for most
.I STREAMS
implementations,
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
uses recursive locks and will not deadlock when called multiple times for the same queue.
.PP
The caller must not call queue
.I STREAMS
utility functions that manipulate queue state.  These functions include
.\".BR bcanget (9),
.BR bcanput (9),
.BR bcanputnext (9),
.\".BR canget (9),
.BR canput (9),
.BR canputnext (9),
.BR enableok (9),
.BR flushband (9),
.BR flushq (9),
.BR getq (9),
.BR noenable (9),
.BR put (9),
.BR putbq (9),
.BR putq (9),
.BR qcountstrm (9),
.BR qenable (9),
.BR qprocsoff (9),
.BR qprocson (9),
.BR qreply (9),
.BR qsize (9),
.BR SAMESTR (9).
.\".BR appq (9),
.\".BR insq (9),
.\".BR rmvq (9),
.\".BR setq (9),
.\".BR strqget (9),
.\".BR strqset (9).
Calling these functions with a frozen queue will result in single-party deadlock of the calling
processor.
.PP
.BR freezestr ()
called with a private queue pair allocated with
.BR allocq (9)
will only lock the queue and cannot freeze the Stream or block procedures,
callouts and callbacks.  It cannot prevent
.I q->q_next
from being changed.  For private queue pairs, it is the caller's responsibility to protect the queue
linkage and synchronize procedures.
.PP
The
.I q->q_flag
member is never protected against writes by freezing the Stream.  The
.I q->q_flag
member must be considered a read-only field or must be accessed with atomic bit operations.
.PP
A procedure calling
.BR freezestr ()
and returning without calling
.BR unfreezestr (9)
will indefinitely postpone interrupts on the calling processor, manipulation of the Stream
.RI [ qi_qopen (9),
.IR qi_qclose (9)],
and and queue procedures (insq, rmvq) on the frozen queue.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR freezestr ()
acquires the
.I sd_freeze
read-write lock as a writer which prevents threads on other processors from entering
.IR qi_qopen (9),
.IR qi_qclose (9),
.IR qi_putp (9),
and
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedures, and also prevents threads on other processors from changing the state of the
Stream,
or the state of any queue in the
Stream.
.PP
Whenever a queue write lock is taken to alter the state of a queue, a read lock is first taken on the
.I sd_freeze
lock.  When the queue write lock is released, the read lock on
.I sd_freeze
is also released.  This ensures that the state of any queue in the
Stream
cannot change while the
Stream
is frozen
.RI ( sd_freeze
is write locked).
.PP
Whenever a
Stream head
write lock is taken to alter the plumbing of the
Stream,
a read lock is first taken on the
.I sd_freeze
lock.  When the
Stream head
write lock is release, the read lock on
.I sd_freeze
is also released.  This ensures that the plumbing of queues in the
Stream
cannot change while the
Stream
is frozen
.RI ( sd_freeze
is write locked).
.PP
.IR qi_qopen (9),
and
.IR qi_qclose (9),
procedures acquire a
Stream head
write lock (to alter the
Stream),
before they execute.
The will spin on the lock if the
Stream 
is frozen
.RI ( sd_freeze
is write locked).
.PP
.IR qi_putp (9)
and
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedures acquire and release the
.I sd_freeze
lock in read mode when they execute.  They will spin on the lock if the
Stream
is frozen
.RI ( sd_freeze
is write locked).
.PP
Additional operations that take
Stream head
write locks are also blocked.  These operations are as follows:
.BR stropen (9),
.BR strclose (9),
.BR I_ANCHOR (7),
.BR I_FATTACH (7),
.BR I_LINK (7),
.BR I_PLINK (7),
.BR I_POP (7),
.BR I_PUNLINK (7),
.BR I_PUSH (7),
.BR I_SERROPT (7),
.BR I_SETSIG (7),
.BR I_SRDOPT (7),
.BR I_SWROPT (7),
and
.BR I_UNLINK (7).
.\" =================================================
.PP
Read locks on the
.I sd_freeze
lock are recursive in the sense that a thread that holds a write lock will always be given a read
lock.  This permits functions that alter queue state (such as
.BR putq (9),
.BR insq (9),
.BR putbq (9),
.BR rmvq (9),
.BR getq (9),
.BR appq (9)),
to be called while the
Stream
is frozen with
.BR freezestr ().
.\".PP
.\".BR freezestr ()
.\"is implemented by taking a recursive write lock on the Stream head with interrupt suppression.  This
.\"protects all of the
.\".I q->q_next
.\"pointers in the entire Stream.
.\".BR freezestr ()
.\"also takes a recursive write lock on the queue structure referenced by
.\".IR q .
.\"This protects all of the members of the queue structure as well as the
.\".I mp->b_next
.\"pointers of messages on the queue.  Note that
.\".I q->q_flags
.\"are not protected by structure locks but are operated on using atomic bit operations.
.\".PP
.\"Because recursive locks are taken, calling
.\".BR freezestr ()
.\"for a frozen Stream will not result in single-part deadlock.

.SS tirdwr Example
.PP
The behaviour of the
.BR tirdwr (4)
module requires that it search the
Stream head
read queue for specific messages.  The detailed requirement is as follows:
.RS
.ll -7n
.PP
When the
.BR tirdwr (4)
module is pushed on the
Stream,
and as part of the
.IR qi_qopen (9)
procedure for the module, the module checks if there are any messages with control parts that it
would not have normally passed that are queued for read at the
.IR "Stream head" .
If such messages exist, the
.BR tirdwr (4)
module returns error
.RB [ EPROTO ]
to the module
.IR qi_qopen (9)
routine and fails the push on the
Stream.
.ll +7n
