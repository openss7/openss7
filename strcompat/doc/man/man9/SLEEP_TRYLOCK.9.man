.SH NAME
.B SLEEP_TRYLOCK

.B #define _SVR4_SOURCE
.br
.B #include <sys/ksynch.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/ddi.h>
.HP
.BI "int SLEEP_TRYLOCK(sleep_t *" lockp );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP \w'priority\(em'u
.I lockp
A pointer to the
.B sleep_t
sleep lock structure to attempt to acquire.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR SLEEP_ALLOC (9),
.BR SLEEP_DEALLOC (9),
.BR SLEEP_LOCKAVAIL (9),
.BR SLEEP_LOCK (9),
.BR SLEEP_LOCKOWNED (9),
.BR SLEEP_LOCK_SIG (9),
.BR SLEEP_TRYLOCK ()
and
.BR SLEEP_UNLOCK (9),
are a set of primitive functions for allocating, deallocating, initializing,
acquiring, releasing and testing sleep locks of type
.BR sleep_t .
.PP
.BR SLEEP_TRYLOCK ()
attempts to immediately acquire a sleep lock.  If the sleep lock is not
immediately available,
.BR SLEEP_TRYLOCK ()
will return.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.BR SLEEP_TRYLOCK ()
succeeds in acquiring the lock, it returns true (1);
otherwise, it returns false (0) and returns without acquiring the lock.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR SLEEP_TRYLOCK ()
is always successful.  If passed invalid or uninitialized arguments, the
results will be indeterminate.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR SLEEP_TRYLOCK ()
can be called from any context.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR SLEEP_TRYLOCK ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR SLEEP_TRYLOCK ()
is a
.IR "SVR 4.2" -specific
function:
.B _SVR4_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR4
defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR SLEEP_TRYLOCK ()
is implemented
by calling
.BR down_trylock (9)
on the
.B sleep_t
sempahore.
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR SLEEP_ALLOC (9),
.BR SLEEP_DEALLOC (9),
.BR SLEEP_LOCKAVAIL (9),
.BR SLEEP_LOCK (9),
.BR SLEEP_LOCKOWNED (9),
.BR SLEEP_LOCK_SIG (9),
.BR down_trylock (9)
.BR SLEEP_UNLOCK (9),
.BR STREAMS (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR SLEEP_TRYLOCK ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR SLEEP_TRYLOCK ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI"
.[
usldk
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR SLEEP_TRYLOCK ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for the purpose of porting
.IR "SVR 4.2"
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR "SVR 4.2"
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR SLEEP_TRYLOCK ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR SLEEP_TRYLOCK ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.

See
.BR STREAMS (9)
