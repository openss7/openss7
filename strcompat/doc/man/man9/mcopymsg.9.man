.SH NAME
.B mcopymsg
\- copy a \fISTREAMS\fR message chain into a buffer
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #define _SUN_SOURCE
.br
.B #include <sys/ddi.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/strsun.h>
.HP
void \fBmcopymsg\fR(mblk_t *\fImp\fR, unsigned char *\fIbuf\fR);
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I mp
a pointer to the message blocks to copy into the supplied buffer.
.TP
.I buf
the supplied buffer.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR mcopymsg ()
copies all of the message blocks in the message chain pointed to by
.I mp
into the caller supplied buffer,
.IR buf .
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR mcopymsg ()
can be used in
.I STREAMS
.BR ioctl (2)
handling code to copy data from a
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
or
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)
message.
.PP
It is the callers responsibility to ensure that there is sufficient room in the provided buffer to
accept all of the data from the passed in message block chain.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR mcopymsg ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR mcopymsg ()
always succeeds; however, if passed an invalid pointer or argument,
.BR merror ()
could destabilize the kernel or result in a kernel panic.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR mcopymsg ()
can be called from any non-interrupt context, but is normally called from a
.I STREAMS
module or driver write-side put or service procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR mcopymsg ()
is MP-safe; however, the caller is responsible for ensuring exclusive access to the passed in
message block.  This is normally the case when
.BR mcopymsg ()
is called from a
.I STREAMS
module or driver write-side put or service procedure and the passed in message pointer is that which
was passed into the procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR mcopymsg ()
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function:
.B _SUN_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SUN
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SUN_MODULE
defined.

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR mcopymsg ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR mcopymsg ()
is compatible with
.IR Solaris \(rg
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR mcopymsg ()
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function that should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
For maximum portability, the message blocks and structures should be manipulated directly using
standard
.I STREAMS
utilities in its stead.
.IP \(em
.BR mcopymsg ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR Solaris \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR Solaris \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR Solaris \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR mcopymsg ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR Solaris \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR mcopymsg ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR suncompat (9)
and
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
