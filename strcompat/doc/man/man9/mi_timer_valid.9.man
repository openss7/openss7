.PP
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR mi_timer_valid ()
is a
.IR MacOT \(rg-specific
function:
.B _MAC_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC_MODULE
defined.
.PP
Timer messages enter ther target queue as
.BR M_PCSIG (9)
messages.  Whenever a queue that can receive a timer message receives a
.BR M_PCSIG (9)
message, it should call
.BR mi_timer_valid (9),
passing the
.BR M_PCSIG (9)
message as a parameter.  If the function returns true, then the timer message is valid and should be
processed.  If the function returns fales, then the timer message was either deleted or canceled.
In this case, the correct course of action is to ignore the message (i.e. do not free it).
.PP
.B Warning:
This function may not be called at interrupt time, and it may not be called twice on the same timer.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR mi_timer_valid ()
is compatible with
.IR MacOT \(rg
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.IP \(em
.IP \(em
.BR mi_timer_valid ()
is an
.IR MacOT \(rg-specific
function and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
The more common
.BR toid_t
should be used in its stead.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_timer_valid ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR MacOT \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR MacOT \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR MacOT \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_timer_valid ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR MacOT \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR mi_timer_valid ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.

See
.BR maccompat (9)
and
.BR STREAMS (9)
