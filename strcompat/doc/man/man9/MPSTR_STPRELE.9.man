.SH NAME
.B MPSTR_STPRELE
\- release a stream head from exclusive access
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #define _SVR4_SOURCE
.br
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "void MPSTR_STPRELE(struct stdata *" stp ", pl_t " priority );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP \w'priority\(em'u
.I stp
A pointer to the stream head
.B stdata (9)
structure to release from exclusive access.
.TP
.I priority
The interrupt priority level to restore.
A value of minus one (-1) indicates that the interrupt priority level is not to be restored.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR MPSTR_STPRELE ()
releases an exclusive (write) lock on the
.BR stdata (9)
structure specified by the
.I stp
argument and restores the interrupt priority level specified by the
.I priority
argument.  If the
.I priority
argument is minus one (-1), no interrupt priority level will be restored.  The
lock must have been previously been acquired using
.BR MPSTR_STPLOCK (9), and the
.I priority
argument is normally the interrupt priority level returned from the call to
.BR MPSTR_STPLOCK (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR MPSTR_STPRELE ()
is used to release exclusive access to a
.BR stdata (9)
structure that was acquired for the purpose of manipulating members of the
structure and related
.BR queue (9)
structures.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR MPSTR_STPRELE ()
returns
.BR void.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR MPSTR_STPRELE ()
is always successful.  Calling
.BR MPSTR_STPRELE ()
with invalid or uninitialized arguments, or for a
.I stp
that has not been previously acquired using
.BR MPSTR_STPLOCK (9)
will yeild indeterminate results.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR MPSTR_STPRELE ()
can be called from any context, except interrupt service routines.  If other
processors are spinning on awaiting acquiring the lock, one processor will
succeed.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR MPSTR_STPRELE ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR MPSTR_STPRELE ()
is a
.IR "SVR 4.2" -specific
function:
.B _SVR4_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR4
defined.
.PP
See
.BR MPSTR_STPLOCK (9)
for additional notices.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR MPSTR_STPRELE ()
unnests the
.I sd_qlock
member of the
.BR stdata (9)
structure specified by
.IR stp ,
based on the owning
.B task_struct
task structure as specified by the
.IR sd_owner " and " sd_nest
members.
In addtion,
.BR MPSTR_STPRELE ()
restores the interrupt mask specified by the
.I priority
argument.

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR MPSTR_STPRELE ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR MPSTR_STPRELE ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI"
.[
usldk
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.B Linux
does not have interrupt priority levels in the same sense as
.IR "SVR 4.2" .
The
.I priority
arguemnt of
.BR MPSTR_STPRELE ()
corresponds to interrupt flags returned by
.BR MPSTR_STPLOCK (9)
rather than
.BR spl .
See
.BR splx (9)
for more information.
.IP \(em
.BR MPSTR_STPRELE ()
is implemented as an
.B extern inline
function.
.I "SVR 4.2 MP"
and systems based on
.I "SVR 4.2"
implement
.BR MPSTR_STPRELE ()
as a C preprocessor macro.
.IP \(em
.BR MPSTR_STPRELE ()
is implemented as a recursive (nesting) release, meaning that it can be called
on a queue multiply locked by
.BR MPSTR_STPLOCK (9).
Some systems based on
.I SVR 4.2 MP
implement
.BR MPSTR_STPRELE ()
as a non-recursive release.
.IP \(em
.BR MPSTR_STPRELE ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for the purpose of porting
.IR "SVR 4.2"
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR "SVR 4.2"
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR MPSTR_STPRELE ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR MPSTR_STPRELE ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR STREAMS (9)
