.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR mi_open_link ()
links the private structure,
.IR ptr ,
into a common open list,
.IR mi_head ,
and performs the other necessary functions of the
.BR qi_qopen (9)
routine for a
.I STREAMS
module or driver, as follows:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
When
.I sflag
is set to
.BR CLONEOPEN ,
.BR mi_open_link ()
will assign the first available minor device number starting at minor device
number 11.
When no minor device numbers remain available for assignment,
.RB [ EAGAIN ]
is returned.
.IP \(bu
When
.I sflag
is set to
.BR DRVOPEN ,
.BR mi_open_link ()
will assign the device number specified in
.I devp
if it is available or return
.RB [ ENXIO ]
otherwise.
.IP \(bu
When
.I sflag
is set to
.BR MODOPEN ,
the private structure is simply linked into the list with no device number.
.PP
Private structures added to a common open list using
.BR mi_open_link ()
must be removed from the list either directly or indirectly by calling
.BR mi_close_unlink (9).
.BR mi_close_unlink (9)
is called indirectly by
.BR mi_detach (9)
and
.BR mi_close_comm (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR mi_open_link ()
is not normally used directly.  It is a lower level helper function that is
used to implement
.BR mi_open_comm (9).
Typically, only
.BR mi_open_comm (9)
is used directly by the
.I STREAMS
driver or module writer.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.BR mi_open_link ()
succeeds, it returns zero
.RB ( 0 );
when it fails, it returns a positive error number (suitable to be used
as the return value of the
.BR qi_qopen (9)
call).
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR mi_open_link ()
fails when it cannot assign a minor device number to the Stream.  When
.BR mi_open_link ()
fails, it returns an appropriate positive error number as follows:
.TP \w'[\fBEAGAIN\fR]\(em'u
.RB [ ENXIO ]
.I sflag
was
.BR DRVOPEN ,
and the device number specified by
.I devp
is already in use.
.TP
.RB [ EAGAIN ]
.I sflag
was
.BR CLONEOPEN ,
and no minor device number remain available for assignment.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR mi_open_link ()
can be called from process context.
.BR mi_open_link ()
is intended to be called from within the
.BR qi_qopen (9)
routine of a
.I STREAMS
driver or module.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR mi_open_link ()
is MP-safe.  The implementation hold a global list lock while dereferencing or
otherwise manipulating list pointers.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR mi_open_link ()
is an
.IR MPS \(rg-specific
function:
.BR _MPS_SOURCE ,
.B _AIX_SOURCE
or
.B _MAC_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
must also have been compiled with
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MPS ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MPS_MODULE ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_AIX ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_AIX_MODULE ,
.BR CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC_MODULE
defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR mi_open_link ()
places the private structure in an appopriate location in the private
structure linked list sorted by device number.  If
.I devp
is set to a specific device number,
.I sflag
is not
.BR CLONEOPEN ,
and an entry already exists for that device number,
.RB [ ENXIO ]
is returned.
If
.I devp
has a minor device number of zero or
.I sflag
is
.BR CLONEOPEN ,
an there are no minor device number available to be assigned,
.RB [ EAGAIN ]
is returned.
In all other cases, linking the private structure into the list succeeds.

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR mi_open_link ()
has no known bugs.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR mi_open_link ()
is
compatible with
.IR MPS \(rg,
.IR AIX \(rg,
.IR MacOT \(rg,
and
.IR Solaris \(rg,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.IR AIX \(rg
documents that the first 5 device numbers are reserved for non-clone opens,
and minor device number assignment then begins at 6.
.IR MacOT \(rg
documents that the first 10 device numbers are reserved for non-clone opens,
and minor device number assignment then begins at 11.
.BR mi_open_link ()
follows the
.IR MacOT \(rg
.[
macspg
.]
numbering because it is also compatible with
.IR AIX \(rg.
.[
aixcpc
.]
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules using this function will not depend on where specifically
the first clone open minor device number assignment begins above 5.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_open_link ()
is an
.IR MPS \(rg-specific
function and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
The more common
.BR zzz ()
function should be used in its stead.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_open_link ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR MPS \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR MPS \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
.[
@PACKAGE@
.]
differ from that of
.IR MPS \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_open_link ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR MPS \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR mi_open_link ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR mpscompat (9),
.BR aixcompat (9),
