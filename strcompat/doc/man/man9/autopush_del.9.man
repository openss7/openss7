.\"
.\"
.SH NAME
.B autopush_del
\- finds an autopush list entry for a given STREAMS device number
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/stropts.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/sad.h>
.HP
.BI "int autopush_del(struct strapush *" sap );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I sap
a pointer to a
.B strapush
structure describing the autopush list to delete.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR autopush_del ()
performs the same function within the kernel as is provided to user space via
the
.B SAD_GAP
IO control to the
.BR sad (4)
STREAMS Adminstrative Driver.
This function finds and returns a pointer to the autopush list associated with
the
.IR STREAMS (4)
character major device specified by
.IR cdev ,
and the character minor device specified by
.IR minor .
The autopush list is described by a pointer to a
.B strapush
structure formatted as follows:
.nf
\fC\s-1
struct strapush {
        unit_t ap_cmd;
        major_t sap_major;
        minor_t sap_minor;
        minor_t sap_lastminor;
        unit_t sap_npush;
        unit_t sap_list[MAXAPUSH][FMNAMESZ + 1];
};
\s+1\fP
.fi
.TP \w'\ sap_lastminor\ 'u
.I ap_cmd
Not meaningful.  The caller should ignore the value returned in this field.
.TP
.I sap_major
The character major device number associated with the
.IR STREAMS (4)
device to which
this autopush list belongs.
.TP
.I sap_minor
The first character minor device number in a range associated with the
.IR STREAMS (4)
device to which this autopush list belongs.  This value will be less than or
equal to the
.I minor
argument.
.TP
.I sap_lastminor
The last character minor device number in a range associated with the
.IR STREAMS (4)
device to which this autopush list belongs.  This value will be greater than
or equal to the
.I minor
argument.
.TP
.I sap_npush
The number of modules in the autopush list.  This number will be greater than
or equal to one and less than or equal to
.BR MAXAPUSH .
.TP
.I sap_list
The array of module names that contains
.I sap_npush
module names representing the module autopush list.
.\"
.\"
.PP
.BR autopush_del ()
is useful along with
.BR autopush_add (9)
and
.BR autopush_del (9)
when registering
.IR STREAMS (4)
character devices with
.BR register_strdev (9).
.BR autopush_del ()
permits a kernel module to find the autopush list within a
.BR cdevsw
table entry.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR autopush_del ()
is a
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" -specific
function.
.BR autopush_del ()
should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers or modules.  Instead, the
user-space
.I STREAMS
autopush utility
.BR sad (8)
should be used instead.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR autopush_del ()
returns a pointer to the
.B strapush
structure describing the autopush list for the requested
.IR STREAMS (4)
device.
Upon failure,
.BR autopush_del ()
returns
.BR NULL .
.\"
.\"
.SH "ERRORS"
.PP
.BR autopush_del ()
fails and returns
.B NULL
when the autopush list associated with
.I cdev
is empty, or does not contain an entry for the character minor device number
.IR minor .
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR autopush_del ()
can only be called from user context.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR autopush_del ()
is MP-safe.  The caller is responsible to ensure exclusive access to the
passed in
.B strapush
structure
.IR sap .
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR autopush_del ()
simply locates the
.B strapush
structure associated with the
.I cdev
and
.I minor
arguments.  The module name list is neither validated, nor are any kernel
modules loaded as a side-effect of the lookup.
