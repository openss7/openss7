.SH NAME
.B unregister_cmajor
\- unregister external device major number
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/strsubr.h>
.HP
.BI "int unregister_cmajor(struct cdevsw *" cdev ", major_t " major );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I cdev
a pointer to a character device switch table,
.BR cdevsw (9),
structure describing the
.I STREAMS
driver from which to remove a major device node.
.IP
.I major
the major device number of the node to remove.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS ,
internal,
implementation specific.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR unregister_cmajor ()
locates the major device node,
.IR major ,
.I STREAMS
driver specified by
.I cdev
that was registered using
.BR register_cmajor (9),
and calls
.BR unregister_xinode ()
for that device node.
.BR unregister_cmajor ()
then frees the memory associated with the
.BR devnode (9)
structure that was allocated by the call
to
.BR register_cmajor (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
This is probably not the function that you want.  See
.BR unregister_strdev (9).
.PP
.BR unregister_cmajor ()
is called automatically by
.BR unregister_strdev (9)
to unregister a major device number
in the
external
file system for every
.I STREAMS
device driver unregistering.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR unregister_cmajor ()
returns zero
.RB ( 0 );
upon failure, a negative error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR unregister_cmajor ()
fails, it returns an appropriate negative error number as follows:
.TP \w'[\fBEWOULDBLOCK\fR]\(en'u
.RB [ EINVAL ]
.PP
In addition,
.BR unregister_cmajor ()
can return any error number returned by
.BR unregister_xinode ().
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR unregister_cmajor ()
is intended to be called from a blockable process context during just prior to the unloading of a
.I STREAMS
kernel module and as part of the deallocation of that kernel module.
It may also be called at blockable process context as part of a
.IR qi_qclose (9)
routine.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.BR unregister_cmajor ()
is MP-safe when called from the proper context.
.PP
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR unregister_cmajor ()
is a convenience function that simply locates the
.BR devnode (9)
structure,
and unregisters it with
.BR unregister_xinode ().
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR unregister_cmajor ()
is an internal
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
implementation specific
function that is not intended to be used directly by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.  This is certainly not the utility you need: see
.BR unregister_strdev (9).
.PP
Loadable kernel modules that call
.BR register_cmajor (9)
when loading must call
.BR unregister_cmajor ()
before unloading.
.BR unregister_cmajor ()
must be called with the same arguments with which the corresponding
.BR register_cmajor (9)
was called.
.PP
Drivers unregistered with
.BR unregister_cmajor ()
will no longer appear as a directory in the
.B /dev/streams/
directory, visible when the
.BR specfs (5)
file system has been mounted on
.BR /dev/streams.
.PP
If you use
.BR unregister_cmajor ()
from outside of the
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
package, your code may break on the next release.
Do not use
.BR unregister_cmajor ():
use
.BR unregister_strdev (9)
or
.BR unregister_strnod (9)
instead.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP

.IR qi_qclose (9),
.BR unregister_strnod (9),
.BR STREAMS (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR unregister_cmajor ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR unregister_cmajor ()
is a
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
implementation specific function with support for the mountable
.BR specfs (5)
file system.  Registration of
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules is inherently implementation specific and non-portable.
Different implementations provide different mechanisms.
The
.BR strcompat (5)
package for
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
provides additional mechanisms compatible with other implementations.
See also
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONFORMANCE
.PP
Registration and de-registration of
.I STREAMS
drivers is implementation specific and not subject to standardization.
.BR unregister_cmajor ()
is a
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
implementation specific function.
