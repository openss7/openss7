OpenSS7 STREAMS Compatibility Modules
=====================================

This is the strcompat-0.9.2.4 package.  It, and the current version, can
be obtained from the download area of The OpenSS7 Project website at
http://www.openss7.org/download.html as strcompat-0.9.2.4.tar.bz2 using a
command such as

	wget http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/strcompat-0.9.2.4.tar.bz2

Please see the NEWS file for release notes and history of user visible
changes for the current version, and the ChangeLog file for a more
detailed history of implementation changes.  The TODO file lists
features not yet implemented or other outstanding items.

Please see the INSTALL, INSTALL-strcompat and README-make files (or the
installation and reference manual) for installation instructions.  When
working from CVS, please see the README-cvs file.  An abbreviated
installation procedure that works for most applications appears below.

This release of the package is published strictly under Version 2 of the
GNU Public License which can be found in the file COPYING.  Package
specific licensing terms (if any) can be found in the file LICENSING.
Please respect these licensing arrangements.  If you are interested in
different licensing terms, please contact the copyright holder, OpenSS7
Corporation, http://www.openss7.com/ or mailto:bidulock@openss7.org.

See README-alpha (if it exists) for alpha release information.

Prerequisites
-------------

The following are prerequisites for building the package:

 1. Linux distribution with a 2.4 or 2.6 kernel with the appropriate
    tool chain.  For supported and tested distributions, see the manual.

 2. OpenSS7 Linux Fast-STREAMS or OpenSS7 Modified Linux STREAMS
    installed, such as
    http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/streams-0.7a.6.tar.bz2 or
    http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/LiS-2.18.4.tar.bz2

    (Note that the `LiS' package is deprecated.  We recommend using the
    `streams' package instead.)

When configuring and building multiple OpenSS7 Project release packages,
place all of the source packages (unpackaged tarballs) at the same
directory level and all build directories at the same directory level.

When installing packages that install as kernel modules, it is necessary
to have the correct kernel development package installed.  For the
following distributions, use the following commands:

    Ubuntu:  apt-get install linux-headers
    Debian:  apt-get install kernel-headers
    Fedora:  yum install kernel-devel

You also need the same version of gcc compiler with which the kernel
was built.  If it is not the default, add CC=kgcc on the line after
./configure, for example:

	../strcompat-0.9.2.4/configure CC='gcc-3.4'

Installation
------------

The following commands will download, configure, build, check, install,
validate, uninstall and remove the package:

	wget http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/strcompat-0.9.2.4.tar.bz2
	tar -xjvf strcompat-0.9.2.4.tar.bz2
	mkdir build
	pushd build
	../strcompat-0.9.2.4/configure --enable-autotest
	make
	make check
	sudo make install
	sudo make installcheck
	sudo make uninstall
	popd
	sudo rm -rf build
	rm -rf strcompat-0.9.2.4.
	rm -f strcompat-0.9.2.4.tar.bz2

If you have problems, try building with the logging targets instead.  If
the make of a logging target fails, an automatic problem report will be
generated that can be mailed to The OpenSS7 Project.  Installation using
the logging targets proceeds as follows:

	wget http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/strcompat-0.9.2.4.tar.bz2
	tar -xjvf strcompat-0.9.2.4.tar.bz2
	mkdir build
	pushd build
	../strcompat-0.9.2.4/configure --enable-autotest
	make compile.log
	make check.log
	sudo make install.log
	sudo make installcheck.log
	sudo make uninstall.log
	popd
	sudo rm -rf build
	rm -rf strcompat-0.9.2.4.
	rm -f strcompat-0.9.2.4.tar.bz2

See README-make for additional specialized make targets.

For custom applications, see the INSTALL and INSTALL-strcompat files or
the installation and reference manual as listed below.  If you encounter
troubles, see the trouble shooting section of the installation and
reference manual before issuing a bug report.

Manual
------

More detailed installation instructions can be found in the Installation
and Reference Manual, contained in the distribution in `text', `info',
`html', and `pdf' formats:

	cd ../strcompat-0.9.2.4
	less doc/manual/strcompat.txt
	lynx doc/manual/strcompat.html
	info -f doc/manual/strcompat.info
	xpdf doc/manual/strcompat.pdf

The current manual is also always available online from The OpenSS7
Project website at:

	lynx http://www.openss7.org/strcompat_manual.html

Description
-----------

The OpenSS7 STREAMS Compatibility Modules package includes kernel
modules, SVR 4.2 STREAMS drivers, modules, libraries, utilities, test
programs, daemons, and development environment for the development and
execution of STREAMS modules and drivers ported from other operating
system environments to Linux Fast-STREAMS.

This distribution is only currently applicable to Linux 2.4 and 2.6
kernels and was targetted at ix86, x86_64, ppc and ppc64 architectures,
but should build and install for other architectures as well.

The OpenSS7 STREAMS Compatibility Modules package provides compatibility
with the following STREAMS implementations:

* UNIX(R) System V Release 3.2
* UNIX(R) System V Release 4.2
* MPS(R) Mentat Portable Streams
* Linux STREAMS 2.18.0
* AIX(R) 5L Version 5.1 Portable STREAMS Environment
* HP-UX(R) 11.0i v2 STREAMS/UX
* IRIX(R) 6.5.17
* Mac(R) OS 9 Open Transport
* Digital(R) UNIX (OSF/1.2)
* Solaris(R) 9/SunOS(R) 5.9
* UnixWare(R) 7.1.3

These compatiblity module compile as kernel modules and will be demand loaded
into the kernel when used by a specific STREAMS module or driver.  The
compatibility modules ease porting of STREAMS modules and drivers from other
Operating Systems to Linux.

Brief Installation Instructions
-------------------------------

The OpenSS7 STREAMS Compatibility Modules package is available from the
downloads area of The OpenSS7 Project website:
<http://www.openss7.org/download.html> using a command such as:

	wget http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/strcompat-0.9.2.4.tar.bz2

Unpack the tarball using a command such as:

	tar -xjvf strcompat-0.9.2.4.tar.bz2

The tarball will unpack into the relative subdirectory named after the
package name: strcompat-0.9.2.4  The package builds using the GNU autoconf
utilities and the `configure' script.  To build the package, we
recommend using a separate build directory as follows:

	mkdir build
	cd build
	../strcompat-0.9.2.4/configure

In general, the package configures and builds without adding any special
options to the configure script.  For general options to the configure
script, see the GNU `INSTALL' file in the distribution:

	less ../strcompat-0.9.2.4/INSTALL

For specific options to the configure script, see the INSTALL-strcompat
file in the distribution, or simply execute the configure script with
the --help option like so:

	../strcompat-0.9.2.4/configure --help

After configuring the package, the package can be compiled simply by
issuing the `make' command:

	make

Some specialized makefile targets exist, see the README-make file in the
distribution or simply invoke the `help' target like so:

	make help

After successfully building the package, the package can be checked by
invoking the `check' make target like so:

	make check

After successfully checking the package, the package can be installed by
invoking the `install' make target (as root) like so:

	sudo make install

The testsuites that ship with the package can be invoked after the
package has been installed by invoking the `installcheck' target.  This
target can either be invoked as root, or as a normal user, like so:

	make installcheck

(Note: you must add the --enable-autotest flag to `configure', above for
 the testsuites to be invoked with `make installcheck'.)

The package can be cleanly removed by invoking the `uninstall' target
(as root):

	sudo make uninstall

Then the build directory and tarball can be simply removed:

	cd ..
	rm -rf build
	rm -rf strcompat-0.9.2.4
	rm -f strcompat-0.9.2.4.tar.bz2
