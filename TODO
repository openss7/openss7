Things to do:

- Get master build package working better.  Currently the master build
  package does not build a master tarball or RPM distribution, which
  would be nice, only individual RPMs for subpackages.

- Cross-testing framework.  We have nice autotest test suites that are
  fine for native builds, but for cross-compile builds, it would also be
  nice to cross-test.  We can accomplish this nicely within the autoconf
  framework using DejaGNU.  DejaGNU configured under the LiS, but we
  need a more general autoconf .m4 fragement check for the existence of
  DejaGNU, and automake and DejaGNU expect wrappers for the existing
  test programs (and integration into the make check-DEJAGNU target).
  Then we could cross-build the package (e.g. for NexusWare) and then
  execute the test scripts on the result on a remote board using
  DEJAGNU.

- Distributed testing framework.  Because these are mostly
  communications protocols implemented using STREAMS, it is important to
  be able to do consistent distributed testing and validation of the
  protocol implementations.  We can perform much validation using
  Ferry-Clip approaches (linking or pushing STREAMS-based pipes beneath
  drivers or modules), however, acceptance and performance testing would
  benefit from a distributed framework.  Perhaps the most direct yet
  general approach to this is TETware from OpenGroup and is used for
  POSIX (and XNS 5.2, by the way) test suites from OpenGroup.  Although
  netperf incorporates its own client-server subsystem, TETware provides
  these mechanisms separately.  TETware also provides mechanisms for
  test case syncrhonization points between distributed systems that
  makes distributed conformance test cases quite possible.  Note that
  TETware does not really require any external tools but does require
  network access and installation on the target systems (unlike DejaGNU
  that can execute test cases over a serial port if necessary).

- I have all these /** comments that use either kerneldoc or doxygen
  format sprinkled throughout the code.  I would like to get doxygen
  running, or kerneldoc, or write a script of my own.  This
  documentation would be useful for developers and troubleshooters,
  particularly if the code was included with the documentation.  Doxygen
  does this nicely, but only in html, but does not generate manual pages
  or other things very nicely.  Well, I have to do something with that.
  A start would be just providing the autoconf .m4 and automake .am
  fragments necessary to generate doxygen or kerneldoc documentation.

- Automake files (Makefile.am) are too static.  The strbcm package needs
  the list of sources and objects to be rather dynamic.  It would be
  nice to convert all packges to the same approach.  We could perhaps
  use strconf-sh to generate Makefile.in fragments at configuration time
  and then include them in a far more general main Makefile.am file.

- I really want to put all these packages back together, it is too time
  consuming maintaining the various administrative files for each of
  seven or so packages.  Once some more testing has been done on Linux
  Fast-STREAMS, I will drop LiS altogether and wrap the following
  packages together:

	streams-0.7a.5
	strcompat-0.9.2.4
	strutil-0.9.2.4
	strxns-0.9.2.4
	strxnet-0.9.2.9
	strinet-0.9.2.4
	strsctp-0.9.2.6
	netperf-2.3.2

  The result will be just a streams-0.9.4 release.  The only two
  (STREAMS) packages left will be strbcm and strss7.

- I want to someday write an ldterm for Linux Fast-STREAMS and provide
  truly STREAMS-based pseudo terminals.

- Bug reporting.  We have these nice autotest test suites that generate
  a lot of information when a test case fails in testsuite.log.  What I
  would like to do is integrate that to our GNATS problem report system
  so that testsuite will generate the template for a new problem report
  upon test case failure.  Unfortunately autotest does not provide an m4
  diversion point at which to hook into the failure branch of the test
  script.  Several choices:

	- distribute a modified set of autotest macros. uggh.
	- submit a change to autoconf (2.59 is not going away soon).

  Perhaps a better alternative is to provide a make target for problem
  reports that will collect the testsuite.log and any other pertinent
  information and generate a problem report template as a mail text file
  that can then be editted by the user and mailed to the bugs address.
  I like that.  That will work better.

  Better still, it might be a good idea to modify the logging targets to
  automatically generate a problem report when they fail.  That would be
  better.

  *done*

- Provide an option for not installing documentation and development
  headers, etc.  Just the runtime.  This is mostly for embedded targets.
  Make it a --without-devel configure flag that defaults to including
  documentation and development environment.

  *done*
