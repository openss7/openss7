@cindex manual notice
@cindex licensing

This package is released and distributed under the @cite{GNU General Public License} (@pxrefman{GPL}).
Please note, however, that there are different licensing terms for the manual pages and some of the
documentation (derived from OpenGroup@footnote{Formerly X/Open and UNIX International.} publications
and other sources).  Consult the permission notices contained in the documentation for more
information.

This manual is released under the @cite{FDL} (@pxrefman{GNU Free Documentation License}) with all
sections invariant.

@node Abstract
@unnumberedsec Abstract
@cindex manual abstract

This manual provides a @cite{@value{MANUAL_TYPE}} for @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}}.

@unnumberedsubsec Objective
@cindex manual objective

The objective of this manual is to provide a guide for the @dfn{STREAMS} programmer when
developing @dfn{STREAMS} modules, drivers and application programs for @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}}.

This guide provides information to developers on the use of the @dfn{STREAMS} mechanism at user and
kernel levels.

@dfn{STREAMS} was incorporated in UNIX System V Release 3 to augment the character input/output
(I/O) mechanism and to support development of communication services.

@dfn{STREAMS} provides developers with integral functions, a set of utility routines, and facilities
that expedite software design and implementation.

@unnumberedsubsec Intent
@cindex manual intent

The intent of this manual is to act as an introductory guide to the @dfn{STREAMS} programmer.  It
is intended to be read alone and is not intended to replace or supplement the
@cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} manual pages.  For a reference for writing code, the manual pages
(see @manref{STREAMS(9)}) provide a better reference to the programmer.
Although this describes the features of the @cite{@value{PACKAGE_TITLE}} package,
@uref{http://www.openss7.com/,OpenSS7 Corporation} is under no obligation to provide any software,
system or feature listed herein.

@unnumberedsubsec Audience
@cindex manual audience

This manual is intended for a highly technical audience.  The reader should already be familiar
with @cite{Linux} kernel programming, the @cite{Linux} file system, character devices, driver input
and output, interrupts, software interrupt handling, scheduling, process contexts, multiprocessor
locks, etc.

The guide is intended for network and systems programmers, who use the @dfn{STREAMS} mechanism at
user and kernel levels for @cite{Linux} and @cite{UNIX} system communication services.

Readers of the guide are expected to possess prior knowledge of the @cite{Linux} and @cite{UNIX}
system, programming, networking, and data communication.

This module contains the M2PA @dfn{STREAMS} module.  This module is pushed over an SCTP NPI Stream
to form a complete SS7 signalling link implementation over IP providing the Signalling Link
Interface (SLI).
See @manref{m2pa_sl(4)} for more information.

@item @manpage{m2ua_as(4)} (@file{streams-m2ua_as})

This module contains the M2UA-AS @dfn{STREAMS} module.  This module is pushed over an SCTP NPI
Stream to form a complete SS7 signalling link implementation over IP providing the Signalling Link
Interface (SLI).  This is a simpler AS-side only implementation of M2UA.  See @manref{m2ua_as(4)}
for more information.

@pgindex streams-sdt_tpi

This module contains an TPI @dfn{STREAMS} module.  This module is pushed over any TPI transport
Stream to form a Signalling Data Terminal implementation over IP providing the Signalling Data
Terminal Interface (SDTI).  This is a non-standard but common approach to providing HDLC/DAED
communication using any TPI transport (e.g. UDP) and predates M2PA/M2UA.  See @manref{sdt_tpi(4)}

@node Development Header Files
@subsection Header Files
@cindex development header files

Header files are installed, typically, in the @file{/usr/include/@value{PACKAGE}} subdirectory.  To
use the header files from the package, @samp{-I/usr/include/@value{PACKAGE}} must be included in the
@command{gcc} command line as a C preprocessor option.  This is true regardless of whether user
space or kernel space programs are being compiled.

In general, @samp{-I} include directives on the @command{gcc} command line should be ordered in the
reverse order of the dependencies between packages.  So, for example, if the include files from all
add-on packages are required, the order of these directives would be: @samp{-I/usr/include/strvoip
-I/usr/include/sigtran -I/usr/include/strss7 -I/usr/include/strisdn -I/usr/include/striso
-I/usr/include/strchan -I/usr/include/strsctp -I/usr/include/strsctp -I/usr/include/strsock
-I/usr/include/strnsl -I/usr/include/strxnet -I/usr/include/strxns -I/usr/include/strtty
-I/usr/include/strcompat -I/usr/include/streams}.

Following are the user visable header files provided by the
@command{@value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}} package in directory @file{/usr/include/@value{PACKAGE}}:

@end table

@subsubsection User Space Programs

Typical include files for interacting with @dfn{@value{PACKAGE_UCNAME}} from user space include the
@file{stropts.h} and @file{sys/ua_ioctl.h} header files.  Additional header files for interacting
with specific drivers or modules may also be required.

@subsubsection Kernel Space Drivers and Modules

Typical include files for writing @dfn{STREAMS} modules and drivers for kernel sapce include the
@file{sys/cmn_err.h}, @file{sys/kmem.h}, @file{sys/dki.h}, @file{sys/stream.h}, @file{sys/ddi.h},
@file{sys/strconf.h}, @file{sys/ua_lm.h} header files.  Additional header files for interacting with
specific drivers or modules may also be required.

@node Static and Shared Libraries
@subsection Libraries
@cindex static and shared libraries

Shared or static versions of the @file{libstreams} library must be linked when using the
@command{@value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}} package.  This library must either be specified on the
@command{gcc} command line as a shared library (e.g. @samp{-lstreams}) or as a static library (e.g.
@samp{/usr/lib/libstreams.a}).

If the shared library is linked, include the following options on the @command{gcc} command line:

@table @samp
@item -lstreams
Link to the @file{/usr/lib/libstreams.so} shared library.

@end table

if the static library is linked, include the following options on the @command{gcc} command line:

@table @samp
@item /usr/lib/libstreams.a
Link to the @file{/usr/lib/libstreams.a} static library.

@end table

@node Kernel Module Development
@subsection Kernel Modules
@cindex kernel module development

Developing @dfn{STREAMS} kernel modules is similar to user space programs with regard to header
files.  @file{/usr/include/@value{PACKAGE}} should be placed as an include directory to search in
the @command{gcc} command line.  The rules for compiling @cite{Linux} kernel modules should be
followed.  In particular, several important intracacies should be considered:

@itemize @bullet

@item
The @command{gcc} compiler used to compile the kernel modules must be the same version of compiler
that was used to compile the kernel.

@item
The @command{gcc} command line must have the same compile flags that were used to compile the
kernel.

@item
The @command{gcc} command line must define several important kernel defines including
@samp{-DLINUX}, @samp{-D__KERNEL__}, as well as the basename of the module.

@item
The @command{gcc} command line must include several important include files directly on the command
line such as @samp{--include /@-lib/@-modules/@-@value{_kversion}/@-build/@-include/@-linux/@-autoconf.h} and
maybe even @samp{--include
/@-lib/@-modules/@-@value{_kversion}/@-build/@-include/@-linux/@-modversions.h}.@footnote{The kernel
version @samp{@value{_kversion}} is just an example.  For the running kernel, use the output of
@samp{uname -r}.}

@end itemize

@node Manual Pages
@subsection Manual Pages
@cindex manual pages

The @command{@value{PACKAGE}-@value{VERSION}} package installs a number of manual pages.  The number
of manual pages installed totals several hundred manual pages and they will not be listed here.
