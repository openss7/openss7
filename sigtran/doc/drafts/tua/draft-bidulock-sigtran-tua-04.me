.uh "Abstract"
.pp
This document defines a protocol for the transport of any SS7 TCAP-User
signalling (e.g, INAP, MAP, etc.) over IP using the Stream Control
Transport Protocol.
.[
RFC 2960
%Z 1
.]
The protocol should be modular and symmetric, to allow it to work in
diverse architectures, such as a Signalling Gateway and IP Signalling
End-point architecture.  Protocol elements are added to allow seamless
operation between peers in the SS7 and IP domains.
.uh "Contents"
.pp
A complete table of contents, list of illustrations and tables, and change
history for this document, appears at the end of the document.
.sh 1 "Introduction"
.pp
There is on-going integration of SCN and IP networks.
Network service providers are designing IP-based signalling architectures that
need support for SS7 and SS7-like signalling protocols.  IP provides an
effective way to transport user data and for operators to expand their
networks and build new services.  In these networks, there is a need for
interworking between the SS7 and IP domains.
.[
RFC 2719
%Z 2
.]
.PP
This draft defines a protocol for the transport of SS7 TCAP User protocols,
.[
q771
%Z 2
.]
.[
t1.114
%Z 2
.]
such as MAP and INAP, over IP using the Stream Control Transmission Protocol
(SCTP).
.[
RFC 2960
.]
.sh 2 "Scope"
.pp
This document details the delivery of TC-user messages (MAP, CAP,
INAP, etc.) over IP between two signalling end-points.  Consideration is given
for the transport from an SS7 Signalling Gateway (SG) to an IP signalling node
(such as an IP-resident Database) as described in the Framework Architecture
for Signalling Transport
.[
RFC 2719
.]
This protocol can also support transport of TC-user messages between two
end-points wholly contained within and IP network.
.lp
The delivery mechanism addresses the following criteria:
.bu
Support for transfer of TCAP messages
.bu
Support for TCAP operation class 1, 2, 3 and 4 operation.
.bu
Support for the operation of TC-User protocol peers.
.bu
Support for the management of SCTP transport associations
between signalling gateways and IP-based signalling nodes.
.bu
Support for distributed IP-based signalling nodes.
.bu
Support for the asynchronous reporting of status changes to
management functions.

.lp
\fI\)Application Server (AS)\fR \-
.ix +\n(iiu
a logical entity serving a specific Routing Key.  An example of an Application
Server is a virtual database element handling all HLR or SCP transactions for
a particular SS7 Signalling Point.  The \fI\)AS\fR contains a set of one or

a process instance of an Application Server.  An \fI\)Application Server
Process\fR serves as an active, backup, load-share or broadcast process of an
Application Server (e.g, part of a distributed signalling node or database
element).  Examples of ASPs are MGCs, IP SCPs, or IP HLRs.  An ASP contains an
SCTP end-point and may be configured to process traffic within more that one
\fI\)Application Server\fR.
.lp
\fI\)Association\fR \-

.sh 2 "TUA Overview"
.sh 3 "Signalling Transport Architecture"
.pp
The framework architecture that has been defined for SCN signalling
transport over IP
.[
RFC 2719
.]
uses multiple components, including an IP transport protocol, a
signalling common transport protocol and an adaptation module to support
the services expected by a particular SCN signalling protocol from its
underlying protocol layer.
.pp
In general terms, the TUA architecture can be modeled as a peer-to-peer
architecture.  The first section considers the SS7-to-IP interworking
architectures for TCAP class 1, 2, 3, and 4 operations.  For this case, it is
assumed that the ASP initiates the establishment of the SCTP association with
the SG.
.sh 3 "Protocol Architecture for Classes 1, 2, 3 and 4"
.pp
In this architecture (illustrated in \fI\*(&f\n(&n\fR), the TCAP and TUA layers
interface in the SG.  A Nodal Interworking Function (NIF) provides for
interworking between the TCAP and TUA layers and provides for the transfer of
the user messages as well as management messages.

This architecture, illustrated in \fI\*(&f\n(&n\fR, can be used to carry a
protocol which uses the transport services of TCAP, but is contained within an
IP network.  This allows extra flexibility in developing networks, especially
when interaction between legacy signalling is not needed.  The architecture
removes the need for a signalling gateway function.

.sh 3 "ASP Fail-over Model and Terminology"
.pp
The TUA protocol supports ASP fail-over functions to support a high
availability of transaction processing capability.
.pp
An Application Server can be considered as a list of all ASPs configured or
registered to handled TC-user messages within a certain range of routing
information, or within a certain set of transaction dialogues, known as a
\`Routing Key.\'  One or more ASPs in the list may normally be active to
handle traffic, while others may be inactive but available in the event of
failure or unavailability of the active ASPs.
.pp
For operational considerations, see Appendix A.
.sh 3 "Services Provided by the TUA Layer"
.sh 4 "Support for the transport of TCAP-User Messages"
.pp
The TUA supports the transfer of TC-user messages.  The TUA layer at
the SG and the ASP support the seamless transport of user messages
between the SG and the ASP.
.sh 5 "TCAP Operation Class Support"

Depending on the TC-users supported, the TUA supports the 4
possible TCAP operation classes transparently.  The TCAP operation
classes are defined as follows:

.sh 4 "Interworking with TCAP Management Functions"
.pp
The TUA layer provides interworking with TCAP management functions at the SG
for seamless inter-operation between the SCN network and the IP network.  TUA
provides the following management functions:
.np
Provides an indication to the TC-user at an ASP that an SS7 subsystem, SCCP
User Part or MTP Destination is unavailable.
.np
Provides an indication to the TC-user at an ASP that an SS7 subsystem, SCCP
User Part or MTP Destination is available.
.np
Provides an indication to the TC-user at an ASP that an SS7 subsystem or MTP
Destination is congested (flow controlled).

The interworking with TCAP management messages consists of DUNA, DAVA, DAUD,
DRST, DUPU or SCON messages (defined in \fI\)Section 3\fR) on receipt of
management events (defined by TCAP) to the appropriate ASPs.  The primitives
in \fI\*(&t\n(&b\fR are sent between the TCAP and TUA management functions in
the SG to trigger events in the IP and SS7 domain.
.pp
The TUA layer provides transparent passing of SCCP availability,
unavailability and congestion status indication primitives (N-STATE, N-PCSTATE
and N-COORD) as provided for in \fI\)ITU-T Q.771 2.2.3\fR.
.[
q771
.]
.sh 4 "Support for the Management of SCTP Associations"
.pp
The TUA layer at the SGP maintains the availability state of all configured
remote ASPs, to manage the SCTP Associations and the traffic between TUA
peers.  As well, the active/inactive and congestion state of remote ASPs is
maintained.
.pp
The TUA layer \fB\)MAY\fR be instructed by local management to establish an
SCTP association to a peer TUA node.  This can be achieved using the
M-SCTP_ESTABLISH primitives to request, indicate and confirm the establishment
of an SCTP association with a peer TUA node.  To avoid redundant SCTP
associations between two TUA peers, one side (client) \fB\)SHOULD\fR be
designated to establish the SCTP association, or TUA configuration information
maintained to detect redundant associations (e.g, via knowledge of the
expected local and remote SCTP endpoint addresses).
.pp
Local management \fB\)MAY\fR request from the TUA layer the status of the
underlying SCTP associations using the M-SCTP_STATUS request and confirm
primitives.  Also, the TUA \fB\)MAY\fR autonomously inform local management of
the reason for the release of an SCTP association, determined either locally
within the TUA layer or by a primitive from the SCTP.
.pp
Also, the TUA layer \fB\)MAY\fR inform the local management of the change in
status of an ASP or AS.  This \fB\)MAY\fR be achieved using the M-ASP_STATUS
request or M-AS_STATUS request primitives.
.sh 2 "Functional Areas"
.sh 3 "Dialogue Identifiers, Routing Contexts and Routing Keys"
.pp
The mapping of TCAP messages into dialogues between the SGP and the
Application Servers is determined by Dialogue Identifiers, Routing Keys and
their associated Routing Contexts.
.pp
A Routing Key is essentially a set of TCAP parameters used to direct TCAP
messages; whereas, the Routing Context parameter is a 4-byte value (unsigned
integer) that is associated to that Routing Key in a one-to-one relationship.  The
Routing Context therefore can be viewed as an index into a sending node's
Transaction Mapping Function tables containing the Routing Key entries.
.pp
Possible TCAP address/routing information that comprise a Routing Key entry
includes, for example, a local and remote Point Code, Subsystem Number, Global
Title Address, Application Context, local and remote Transaction Id pairs, or
TC-User specific information such as User Information, IMSI, SLP.  The
particular information used to define a TUA Routing Key is application and
network dependent, and none of the above examples are requirements for TUA.
.pp
An Application Server Process (ASP) may be configured to process signalling
traffic related to more than one Application Server (AS), over a single SCTP
Association.  ASP Active (ASPAC) and ASP Inactive (ASPIA) management
messages (see Section 3) use the Routing Context to discriminate signalling
traffic to be started or stopped.  At an ASP, the Routing Context parameter
uniquely identifies the range of signalling traffic associated with each
Application Server that the ASP is configured to receive.
.sh 3 "Routing Key Limitations"
.pp
Routing Keys \fB\)SHOULD\fR be unique in the sense that each received TCAP
message \fB\)SHOULD\fR have a full or partial match to a single routing
result.  It is not necessary for the parameter range values within a
particular Routing Key to be continuous.  For example, an AS could be
configured to support transaction processing for multiple ranges of
subscribers that are not represented by contiguous Global Title Addresses.
.sh 3 "Managing Routing Context and Routing Keys"
.pp
There are two ways to provision a Routing Key at an SGP.  A Routing Key may be
configured statically using an implementation dependent management interface,
or dynamically managed using the the TUA Routing Key registration procedures.
.pp
When using a management interface to configure Routing Keys, the Transaction
Mapping Function within the SGP is not limited to the set of parameters
defined in this document.  Other implementation dependent distribution
algorithms may be used.
.sh 3 "Transaction Mapping Function"
.pp
To perform its addressing and relaying capabilities, the TUA makes use of an
Transaction Mapping Function (TMF).  This function is considered part of TUA,
but the way it is realized is left implementation or deployment dependent
(local tables, SCCP GTT database, DNS,
.[
RFC 2916
%Z 2
.]
LDAP, etc.)
.pp
The TMF is invoked when a message is received at the incoming interface.
The TMF is responsible for resolving the application context, address and
transaction ids presented in the incoming TCAP message to SCTP associations
and destinations within the IP network.  The TMF will select the key
information available.  The Routing Keys reference an Application Server,
which will normally have one or more ASPs processing transactions for the AS.  The
availability and status of the ASPs is handled by TUA ASP management messages.
.pp
Possible SS7 application context, address or routing information that comprise
a Routing Key entry includes, for example, SCCP subsystem number and SCCP
addresses and Global Title addresses, Transaction ID, and Application Context.
.\"IP addresses and host names could also be used as Routing Key Information.
.pp
It is expected that the routing keys will be provisioned via a MIB, dynamic
registration or an external process, such as a database.
.sh 4 "Transaction Mapping at the SG"
.pp
To direct messages received from the SS7 network to the appropriate IP
destination, the SGP must perform a transaction mapping function using
information from the received TCAP message.
.pp
To support this transaction mapping, the SGP might, for example, maintain the
equivalent of a network address translation table, mapping incoming TCAP
message information to an Application Server for a particular application and
set of transactions.  This could be accomplished by comparing the addressing,
dialog or component portions of the incoming TCAP message to currently defined
Routing Keys in the SGP.  These Routing Keys could in turn map directly to an
Application Server that is enabled by one or more ASPs.  These ASPs proxy
dynamic status information regarding their availability, transaction handling
capabilities and congestion to the SGP using various management messages
defined in the TUA protocol.
.pp
The list of ASPs in the AS is assumed to be dynamic, taking into account the
availability, transaction handling capability and congestion status of the
individual ASPs in the list, as well as configuration changes and possible
fail-over mechanisms.
.pp
Normally, one or more ASPs are active in the AS (i.e, currently processing
transactions) but in certain failure and transition cases it is possible that there
may not be an active ASP available.  The SGP will buffer the message destined
for this AS for a time T(r) or until an ASP becomes available.  When no ASP
becomes available before expiry of T(r), the SGP will flush the buffered
messages and initiate the appropriate TCAP abort procedures.
.pp
If there is no
transaction mapping function
match for an incoming message, a default treatment \fB\)MAY\fR
be specified.  Possible solutions are to provide a default Application Server
to direct all unallocated transactions to a (set of) default ASP(s), or to drop the
messages and provide a notification to management.  The treatment of
unallocated transactions is implementation dependent.
.sh 4 "Transaction Mapping at the ASP"
.pp
To direct messages to the SS7 network, the ASP \fB\)MAY\fR perform a
transaction mapping to choose the proper SGP for the given message.  This is
accomplished by observing the Application Context, Destination Address,
Destination Transaction Id, and other elements of the outgoing message, SS7
network status, SGP availability, and Routing Context configuration tables.
.pp
A Signalling Gateway may be composed of one or more SGPs \*#.
.(d
.ip \*#
\fB\)IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:\-\fR  Where more than one route (or SG) is possible
for routing to the SS7 network, the ASP could, for example, maintain a dynamic
table of available SG routes for the SS7 destinations and subsystems,
taking into account the destination and subsystem availability and congestion
status received from the SG(s), the availability status of individual SGs and
configuration changes or fail-over mechanisms.
.)d
There is, however, no TUA messaging to manage the status of an SGP.  Whenever
an SCTP association to an SGP exists, it is assumed to be available.  Also,
every SGP of one SG communicating with one ASP regarding one AS provides
identical SS7 connectivity to this ASP.
.pp
In general, an ASP routes all responses to the SGP that it received messages
from; within the routing context which it is currently active and receiving
transactions.  The ASP uses the routing context to select the SGP.
.sh 3 "Signalling Gateway SS7 Layers"
.pp
The SG is responsible for terminating up to the TC-user of the SS7 protocol,
and offering an IP-based extension to its users.
.pp
From an SS7 perspective, it is expected that the Signalling Gateway transmits
and receives TCAP messages to and from the SS7 Network over standard SS7
network interfaces, using the services of the SCCP
.[
q711
.]
and MTP
.[
q704
%Z 2
.]
to provide transport of the messages.
.pp
Note that it is also possible for the SCCP services to be provided using the
services of the SCCP-User Adaptation Layer (SUA)
.[
sua-rfc
%Z 2
.]
and the MTP3-User Adaptation Layer (M3UA).
.[
m3ua-rfc
%Z 2
.]
.pp
The TC-SAP through which TUA at the SG obtains its services could reside at a
Signalling Transfer Point (STP) or Signalling End Point (SEP).
.[
q705
%Z 2
.]
.\".pp
.\"The TC-SAP through which TUA at the SG obtains it services could also be
.\"transported using an ISO Network Service Protocol, such as X.25, instead of
.\"using the services of the SCCP.  The SG in this case could be associated with
.\"DTE on a packet or Frame Relay network.  Using the services of FoA, the SG
.\"could reside at an ATM node.
.\".pp
.\"The TC-SAP could also reside on an IP host providing ISOT

.\"or CMOT,

.\".]
.\"or reside at a host providing ISO networking services over Ethernet or ATM
.\"AAL5.
.sh 3 "SS7 and TUA Interworking at the SG"
.pp
The SGP provides a functional interworking of transport functions between the
SS7 network and the IP network by also supporting the TUA adaptation layer.
It allows the TCAP application to exchange  components in dialogues with an
IP-based Application Server Process where the peer TC-User protocol layer
exists.
.pp
To perform TCAP management, it is required that the TC-User protocols at ASPs
receive indications of subsystem availability and congestion, as well as
user part availability and signalling point availability and congestion as
they would be expected by an SS7 TCAP application.  To accomplish this, the
N-PCSTATE, N-STATE and N-COORD primitives received at the TCAP upper layer
interface at the SG need to be propagated to the remote TC-user lower layer
interface at the ASP.
.pp
SCCP management messages (such as SSP, SSA) and MTP management messages (such
as TFP, TFA) received from the SS7 network \fB\)MUST NOT\fR be encapsulated.
The SG \fB\)MUST\fR terminate these messages and generate TUA message as
appropriate.
.sh 3 "Application Server"
.pp
A cluster of Application Servers is responsible for providing the overall
support for one ore more SS7 upper layers.  From an TCAP standpoint, an
Application Part provides complete support for the upper layer service within
a given Application Context.  As an example, an Application Part providing HLR
capabilities could provide complete support for GSM MAP HLR (and any other,
MSC or VLR application parts located at the signalling point) for a given
point code.
.pp
Where an ASP is connected to more than one SG, the TUA layer must maintain
the status of configured SS7 destinations and route messages according to the
availability/congestion status of potentially replicated subsystem.
.sh 3 "SCTP Stream Mapping"
.pp
The TUA supports SCTP streams.  The SG and AS need to maintain a list of SCTP
and TC-Users for mapping purposes.  TC-Users requiring sequenced message
transfer need to be sent over a stream using sequenced delivery.
.pp
TUA \fB\)SHOULD NOT\fR use stream 0 for TUA management messages.  It is
\fB\)OPTIONAL\fR that sequence delivery be used to preserve the order of
management message delivery.
.pp
All TUA Dialogue Handling (DH) messages not using the optional component
handling interface (i.e, DH messages with components included) \fB\)MAY\fR
select unordered delivery, depending on the requirements of the TC-User \*#.
.(d
.ip \*#
\fB\)IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:\-\fR\  When the TC-User selects sequenced delivery
using the "Sequence Control" fields in the Quality of Service parameter, the
DH message \fB\)SHOULD\fR be sent on an SCTP stream using ordered delivery.
When the TC-User does not select sequenced delivery and does not utilize the
optional component handling interface (i.e. the DH message has components
included), the DH message \fB\)MAY\fR be sent on an SCTP stream using
unordered delivery.
.)d
All TUA Component Handling (CH) messages and Dialogue Handling (DH) messages
with external components \fB\)SHOULD\fR select ordered delivery.
.pp
The stream selected is based upon the Sequence Control field in the Quality of
Service parameter, the Dialogue Id given by the TC-User over the primitive
interface and other traffic information available to the SGP or ASP.
.sh 3 "Application Server Redundancy"
.pp
All TQRY and SSNM messages (e.g, TC-BEGIN, N-STATE) which match a provisioned
Routing Key at an SGP are mapped to an Application Server.
.pp
The Application Server is the set of all ASPs associated with a specific
Routing Key.  Each ASP in this set may be active, inactive or unavailable.
Active ASPs handle traffic; inactive ASPs might be used when active ASPs
become unavailable.
.pp
The fail-over model supports an "n+k" redundancy model, where "n" ASPs is the
minimum number of redundant ASPs required to handle traffic and "k" ASPs are
available to take over for a failed or available ASP.  A "1+1" active/backup
redundancy is a subset of this model.  A simplex "1+0" model is also supported
as a subset, with no ASP redundancy.
.sh 3 "Flow Control"
.pp
Local Management at an ASP may wish to stop traffic across an SCTP association
to temporarily remove the association from service or to perform testing and
maintenance activity.  The function could optionally be used to control the
start of traffic onto a newly available SCTP association.
.sh 3 " Congestion Management"
.pp
The TUA layer is informed of local and IP network congestion by means of an
implementation-dependent function (e.g, an implementation-dependent indication
from the SCTP of IP network congestion).
.pp
At an ASP or IPSP, the TUA layer indicates congestion to local TC-users by
means of an appropriate TCAP primitive (N-PCSTATE, N-STATE, TC-NOTICE), as per
current TCAP procedures, to invoke appropriate upper layer responses.  When an
SG determines that the transport of SS7 messages is encountering congestion,
the SG might trigger SS7 Congestion messages to originating SS7 nodes, per the
congestion procedures of the relevant SCCP
.[
q711
.]
.[
t1.112
%Z 2
.]
or MTP
.[
q704

standard.  (The triggering of SS7 Management messages from an SG is an
implementation-dependent function.)
.sh 2 "Definition of TUA Boundaries"
.pp
TUA has three protocol boundaries: an upper boundary between TUA and the
TC-User; a lower boundary between TUA and SCTP; and a layer management
boundary between TUA and the Layer Management Function.

.ip "" 2
The \fI\)Message Length\fR field of the Common Message Header defines
the length of the message in octets, including the header.
.sh 3 "Tag-Length-Value Format"
.pp
TUA messages consist of a Common Message Header followed by zero or more
parameters, as defined by the message type.  The Tag-Length-Value (TLV)
parameters contained in a message are defined in a Tag-Length-Value
format as shown below \*#.
.(d
.ip \*#
\fB\)IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:\-\fR\  The use of TLV in principle allows the
parameters to be placed in a random order in the message.  However, some
guidelines should be considered for easy processing in the following
order:
.ba +\\n(iiu
.bu
parameters needed to correctly process other message parameters,
preferably should precede these parameters (such as Routing Context).
.bu
Mandatory parameters preferably \fB\)SHOULD\fR precede any optional
parameters.
.bu
The data parameter will normally be the final one in the message.
.bu
The receiver \fB\)SHOULD\fR accept parameters in any order, except where
explicitly mandated.

.ip "\fB\)Parameter Tag: 16-bits (unsigned integer)\fR" 2
The Parameter Tag field is a 16-bit identifier of the type of parameter.  It
takes a value of 0 to 65534.
.ip "\fB\)Parameter Length: 16-bits (unsigned integer)\fR" 2
The Parameter Length field contains the size of the parameter in bytes,
including the Parameter Tag, Parameter Length, and Parameter Value fields.
The Parameter Length does not include any padding bytes.  However, composite
parameters will contain all padding bytes, since all parameters contained
within this composite parameter will considered multiples of 4 bytes.
.ip "\fB\)Parameter Value: variable-length\fR" 2
The Parameter Value field contains the actual information to be transferred in
the parameter.  The total length of a parameter (including Tag, Parameter
Length and Value fields) \fB\)MUST\fR be a multiple of 4 bytes.  If the length
of the parameter is not a multiple of 4 bytes, the sender \fB\)MUST\fR pad the
Parameter at the end (i.e., after the Parameter Value field) with all zero
bytes.  The length of the padding \fB\)MUST NOT\fR be included in the
parameter length field.  A sender \fB\)SHOULD NOT\fR pad with more than 3
bytes.  The receiver \fB\)MUST\fR ignore the padding bytes.

When an AS is handling multiple Dialogues, the Dialogue Id parameter
\fB\)MUST\fR be placed in the TUA Message Header.  The Dialogue Id parameter
\fB\)SHOULD\fR always be placed in the TUA Message Header.  The Dialogue Id
parameter \fB\)MAY\fR be excluded from the TUA header for \fI\)TUNI\fR and

The \fI\)Routing Context\fR parameter can contain the following fields:
.ip "\fB\)Routing Context field: list of 32-bit (unsigned integer)\fR" 2
.ip "" 2
The \fI\)Routing Context\fR field contains (a list of) 32-bit unsigned
integers indexing the Application Server traffic that the sending ASP is
configured or registered to receive.  There is one-to-one relationship between
a Routing Context value, an SG Routing Key and an Application Server \*#.
.\"As an AS can only appear in one Network Appearance, the Network Appearance
.\"parameter is not required in the ASP Active message.
.(d
.ip \*#
\fB\)IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:\-\fR\  An Application Server Process may be
configured to process traffic for more than one logical Application
Server.  From the perspective of an ASP, a Routing Context defines a
range of signalling traffic that the ASP is currently configured to
receive from the SG.
.ip
Additionally, the Routing Context parameter identifies the SS7 network
context for the message, for the purposes of logically separating the
signalling traffic between the SGP and the Application Server Process
over a common SCTP Association, when needed.  An example is where an SGP
is logically partitioned to appear as an element in several different
national SS7 networks.  It implicitly defines the SS7 Point Code format
used, the SS7 Network Indicator value and TCAP protocol
type/variant/version used within a separate SS7 network.  It also
defines the network context for the PC and SSN values.  Where an SGP
operates in the context of a single SS7 network, or individual SCTP
associations are dedicated to each SS7 network context, this
functionality is not needed.
.)d
If the Routing Context parameter is present, it \fB\)SHOULD\fR be the first
parameter in the message as it defines the format and/or interpretation of the
parameters containing a PC or SSN value.
.sh 3 "Diagnostic Information"

.ip "" 2
Within a Routing Context, Override, Load-share Types and Broadcast
cannot be mixed.  The Override value indicates that the ASP is operating
in Override mode, and that when the ASP becomes active for the
Application Server, it will take over all traffic for the AS (i.e,
primary/back-up operation), overriding any currently active ASP in the
AS.  In Load-share mode, when the ASP becomes active for the AS, the ASP
will share in the traffic distribution with any other active ASPs.  In
Broadcast mode, when the ASP becomes active for the AS, the ASP will
receive the same traffic as any other active ASPs.

The "Unsupported Traffic Handling Mode" error is sent by a SGP if an ASP sends
an \fI\)ASP Active (ASPAC)\fR message with an unsupported Traffic Mode Type or a Traffic Mode
Type that is inconsistent with the presently configured mode for the
Application Server.  An example would be a case in which the SGP did not
support load-sharing.
.pp
The "Unexpected Message" error \fB\)MAY\fR be sent if a defined and recognized
message is received that is not expected in the current state (in some cases
the ASP may optionally silently discard the message and not send an
\fI\)ERR\fR
message).  For example, silent discard is used by an ASP if it received a TUA
CH or DH
message from an SGP while it was in the ASP-INACTIVE state.  If the Unexpected
message contained Routing Context(s), the Routing Context(s) \fB\)SHOULD\fR be
included in the \fI\)ERR\fR message.
.pp
The "Protocol Error" error is sent for any protocol anomaly (i.e., reception
of a parameter that is syntactically correct but unexpected in the current
situation.
.pp
The "Invalid Stream Identifier" error is sent if a message is received on an
unexpected SCTP stream (e.g, a Management message was received on a stream
other than "0", or a TUA DH or CH message was received on stream "0").
.pp
The "Refused - Management Blocking" error is sent when an \fI\)ASP Up (ASPUP)\fR or \fI\)ASP Active (ASPAC)\fR
message is received and the request is refused for management reasons (e.g,
management lockout").  If this error is in response to an \fI\)ASP Active (ASPAC)\fR message,
the Routing Context(s) in the \fI\)ASP Active (ASPAC)\fR message \fB\)SHOULD\fR be included in
the \fI\)ERR\fR message.

message which does not contain an ASP Identifier parameter when the SGP
requires one.  The ASP \fB\)SHOULD\fR resend the \fI\)ASP Up (ASPUP)\fR message with an ASP
Identifier.
.pp
The "Invalid ASP Identifier" is send by a SGP in response to an \fI\)ASP Up (ASPUP)\fR message
with an invalid (i.e., non-unique) ASP Identifier.
.pp
The "Invalid Parameter Value" error is sent if a message is received with an
invalid parameter value (e.g, a \fI\)DUPU\fR message was received with a Mask value
other than "0").
.pp
The "Parameter Field Error" would be sent if a message is received with a
parameter having a wrong length field.
.pp
The "Unexpected Parameter" error would be sent if a message contains an
invalid parameter.
.pp
The "Destination Status Unknown" Error \fB\)MAY\fR be sent if a DAUD is
received at an SG inquiring of the availability or congestion status of a
destination, and the SG does not wish to provide the status (e.g, the sender
is not authorized to know the status).  For this error, the invalid or
unauthorized Point Code(s) \fB\)MUST\fR be included along with any Network
Appearance or Routing Context associated with the Point Code(s) from the \fI\)DAUD\fR

The Mask parameter can be used to identify a contiguous range of
Affected Point Codes, independent of the point code format.  Identifying
a contiguous range of Affected Point Codes may be useful when a
management event simultaneously affects the status of a series of
destinations at an SG.
.ip "" 2
The Mask parameter is an integer representing a bit mask that can be
applied to the related Affected PC field.  The bit mask identifies how
many bits of the Affected PC field are significant and which are
effectively "wild-carded".  For example, a mask of "8" indicates that
the last eight bits of the PC is "wild-carded".  For an ANSI 24-bit
Affected PC, this is equivalent to signalling that all PCs in an ANSI
Cluster are unavailable.  A mask of "3" indicates that the last 3 bits
of the PC is "wild-carded".  For a 14-bit ITU Affected PC, this is
equivalent to signalling that an ITU Region is unavailable.
.ip "" 2
A Mask value equal (or greater than) the number of bits in the Point
Code indicates that the entire network access is affected: this is used
to indicate network isolation to the ASP.

The \fI\)Component Flags\fR parameter contains the following fields:
.ip "\fB\)Component Flags field: 32-bits\fR" 2
.ip "" 2
The Component Flags field is used to convey information about the
components in a Component Handling (CH) message.  It contains the
following bit fields:
.ba +2
.ip "\fI\)Bits 0-30: Unused\fR" 2
.ip "" 2
These bits are reserved and are coded to zero.
.ip "\fI\)Bit 31: Not Last Bit\fR" 2
.ip "" 2
The Not Last bit is used to indicate whether the component present in
the CH message is the last component of a sequence of segmented
components.  It has the following values:
.ix +4
.TS
tab(:);
nl.
0:Last component in a component sequence.
1:Not the last component in a component sequence.
.TE
.ix -4
.ip "" 2
To smoothly interwork with TCAP, TUA includes a mechanism whereby
components can be segmented: the CH message with the "Not Last" bit set
in the Component Flags field provides for the initial segments of a
segmented component, whereas the CH message with the "Not Last" bit
clear in the Component Flags field provides for the final (or only)
segment in a sequence of component segments representing the complete
component.  When interworking with TCAP, each component segment may be
sent in a different TCAP package.

.ip "\fB\)Network Appearance field: 32-bits (unsigned integer)\fR" 2
.ip "" 2
The Network Appearance field identifies the SS7 network context for the
Routing Key.  The Network Appearance value is of local significance
only, coordinated between the SG and ASP.  Therefore, in the case where
the ASP is connected to more than one SG, the same SS7 Network context
may be identified by a different Network Appearance value depending upon
to which SG the ASP is registering.
.ip "" 2
In the Routing Key, the Network Appearance identifies the SS7 Point Code
and Global Title Transaction Type format used, and the SCCP, TCAP and
TC-User protocol (type, variant and version) used within the specific
SS7 network.

.sh 3 "Receipt of Primitives from TCAP"
.pp
Upon receiving a TC indication or confirmation primitive from TCAP at an SG,
the Nodal Interworking Function passes the primitive to TUA.  The TUA layer
sends a corresponding TUA Dialogue Handling (DH) or Component Handling (CH)
message (see Section 3) to its TUA peer at the ASP.
.pp
The TUA peer receiving the DH or CH message delivers the corresponding TC
primitive to the TC-User at the ASP as illustrated in \fI\)\*(&f\n(&p\fR.  The
mapping of TC primitives to TUA DH Messages is listed in \fI\)Table 2\fR, and
the CH Messages in \fI\)Table 3\fR (see Section 1.6.1).
.pp
The TUA Transaction Mapping Function (see Section)
.pp
For TC-BEGIN indications, the TUA Transaction Mapping Function (TMF)
determines the Application Server (AS) based on comparing the address and
dialogue portion information in the primitive with a provisioned Routing Key.
.pp
From the list of ASPs within an AS table, an ASP in the ASP-ACTIVE state is
selected and a \fI\)TQRY\fR message is constructed and issued on the corresponding
SCTP association.  The TUA at the SG is also responsible for assigning and
managing a Dialogue Identifier which is sent to the ASP in the \fI\)TQRY\fR message to
identify the newly created dialogue to the ASP.  Information associated with
the dialogue is stored in the SG in an implementation dependent manner;
however, the SG must be capable of associating further TUA messages with the
correct Dialogue at the SG.  The SG will have to access this stored
information to continue processing the dialogue.
.pp
The TUA Transaction Mapping Function (TMF) determines the Application Server
(AS) based on comparing the information in the primitive with a provisioned
Routing Key.
.pp
.sh 4 "Receipt of Management Primitives from TCAP"
.pp
When TCAP Management indications are received (N-STATE, N-PCSTATE, N-COORD),
TCAP Management determines whether there are concerned local TC-Users.  When
these local TC-Users are in fact Application Servers, serviced by ASPs, TUA
management is transparently informed with the N-STATE, N-PCSTATE, N-COORD
indication primitive upon which it formats and transfers the applicable SSNM
message (\fI\)DUNA\fR, \fI\)DAVA\fR, \fI\)DRST\fR, \fI\)DUPU\fR or
\fI\)SCON\fR) to the list of concerned ASPs.
.pp
The TUA message distribution function determines the Application Server (AS)
based on comparing the information in the TC-BEGIN, TC-CONTINUE, TC-END, or
TC-ABORT primitive with a provisioned Routing Key.
.pp
From the list of ASPs within the AS table, an ASP in the ASP-ACTIVE state is
selected and Dialogue Handling (DH) and Component Handling (CH) messages are
constructed and issued on the corresponding SCTP association.  If more than
one ASP is in the ASP-ACTIVE state (i.e., traffic is to be load-shared across
more than one ASP), one of the ASPs in the ASP-ACTIVE state is selected from
the list.  (If the ASPs are in Broadcast Mode, all active ASPs will be
selected and the message sent to each of the active ASPs.)  The selection
algorithm is implementation dependent but could, for example, be round robin
or based on the SLS.  The appropriate selection algorithm must be chosen
carefully as it is dependent on application assumptions and understanding of
the degree of state coordination between the ASP-ACTIVE ASPs in the AS.
.pp
In addition, the message needs to be sent on the appropriate SCTP stream,
again taking care to meet the message sequencing needs of the signalling
application.  Dialogue Handling (DH) and Component Handling (CH) messages
\fB\)SHOULD\fR be sent on an SCTP stream other than stream `0'.
.pp
When there is no Routing Key match, or only a partial match, for an incoming
SS7 message, a default treatment \fB\)MAY\fR be specified.  Possible solutions
are to provide a default Application Server at the SGP that directs all
unallocated traffic to a (set of) default ASP(s), or to drop the message and
provide a notification to Layer Management in an M-ERROR indication primitive.
The treatment of unallocated traffic is implementation dependent.
.sh 3 "Receipt of Primitive from the Layer Management"
.pp
On receiving primitives from the local Layer Management, the TUA layer will
take the requested action and provide an appropriate response primitive to
Layer Management.
.pp
An M-SCTP_ESTABLISH request primitive from Layer Management at an ASP or IPSP
will initiate the establishment of an SCTP association.  The TUA layer will
attempt to establish an SCTP association with the remote TUA peer by sending
an SCTP-ASSOCIATE primitive to the local SCTP layer.
.pp
When an SCTP association has been successfully established, the SCTP
will send an SCTP-COMMUNICATION_UP notification primitive to the local TUA
layer.  At the ASP or IPSP that initiated the request, the TUA layer will send
an M-SCTP_ESTABLISH confirm primitive to Layer Management when the association
setup is complete.  At the peer TUA layer, an M-SCTP_ESTABLISH indication
primitive is sent to Layer Management upon successful completion of an
incoming SCTP association setup.
.pp
An M-SCTP_RELEASE request primitive from Layer Management initiates the
shutdown of an SCTP association.  The TUA layer accomplishes a graceful
shutdown of the SCTP association by sending an SCTP-SHUTDOWN primitive to the
SCTP layer.
.pp
When the graceful shutdown of the SCTP association has been accomplished, the
SCTP layer returns an SCTP-SHUTDOWN_COMPLETE notification primitive to the
local TUA layer.  At the TUA Layer that initiated the request, the TUA layer
will send an M-SCTP_RELEASE confirm primitive to Layer Management when the
association shutdown is complete.  At the peer TUA Layer, an M-SCTP_RELEASE
indication primitive is sent to Layer Management upon abort or successful
shutdown of an SCTP association.
.pp
An M-SCTP_STATUS request primitive supports a Layer Management query of the
local status of a particular SCTP association.  The TUA layer simply maps the
M-SCTP_STATUS request primitive to an SCTP-STATUS primitive to the SCTP layer.
When the SCTP responds, the TUA layer maps the association status information
to an M-SCTP_STATUS confirm primitive.  No peer protocol is invoked.
.pp
Similar LM-to-TUA-to-SCTP and SCTP-to-TUA-to-LM primitive mappings can be
described for the various other SCTP Upper Layer primitives in RFC 2960
.[
rfc2960
.]
such as INITIALIZE, SET PRIMARY, CHANGE HEARTBEAT, REQUEST HEARTBEAT, GET SRTT
REPORT, SET FAILURE THRESHOLD, SET PROTOCOL PARAMETERS, DESTROY SCTP INSTANCE,
SEND FAILURE, AND NETWORK STATUS CHANGE.  Alternatively, these SCTP Upper
Layer primitives (and Status as well) can be considered for modeling purposes
as a Layer Management interaction directly with the SCTP Layer.
.pp
M-NOTIFY indication and M-ERROR indication primitives indicate to Layer
Management the notification or error information contained in a received TUA
\fI\)Notify (NTFY)\fR or \fI\)Error (ERR)\fR message respectively.  These
indications can also be generated based on local TUA events.
.pp
An M-ASP_STATUS request primitive supports a Layer Management query of the
status of a particular local or remote ASP.  The TUA layer responds with the
status in an M-ASP_STATUS confirm primitive.  No TUA peer protocol is invoked.
An M-AS_STATUS request supports a Layer Management query of the status of a
particular AS.  The TUA responds with an M-AS_STATUS confirm primitive.  No
TUA peer protocol is invoked.
.pp
M-ASP_UP request, M-ASP_DOWN request, M-ASP_ACTIVE request and M- ASP_INACTIVE
request primitives allow Layer Management at an ASP to initiate state changes.
Upon successful completion, a corresponding confirm primitive is provided by
the TUA layer to Layer Management.  If an invocation is unsuccessful, an Error
indication primitive is provided in the primitive.  These requests result in
outgoing \fI\)ASP Up (ASPUP)\fR, \fI\)ASP Down (ASPDN)\fR, \fI\)ASP Active
(ASPAC)\fR and \fI\)ASP Inactive (ASPIA)\fR messages to the remote TUA peer at
an SGP or IPSP.
.sh 2 "Procedures to Support the Management of SCTP Associations"
.sh 3 "Receipt of TUA Peer Management Messages"
.pp
Upon successful state changes resulting from reception of \fI\)ASP Up
(ASPUP)\fR, \fI\)ASP Down (ASPDN)\fR, \fI\)ASP Active (ASPAC)\fR and \fI\)ASP
Inactive (ASPIA)\fR messages from a peer TUA, the TUA layer \fB\)MAY\fR invoke
corresponding M-ASP_UP, M-ASP_DOWN, M-ASP_ACTIVE and M-ASP_INACTIVE,
M-AS_ACTIVE, M-AS_INACTIVE, and M-AS_DOWN indication primitives to the local
Layer Management.
.pp
M-NOTIFY indication and M-ERROR indication primitives indicate to Layer
Management the notification or error information contained in a received TUA
\fI\)Notify (NTFY)\fR or \fI\)Error (ERR)\fR message.  These indications can
also be generated based on local TUA events.
.pp
All MGMT, ASPSM, ASPTM and RKM messages, except \fI\)BEAT\fR, \fI\)BEAT ACK\fR
and \fI\)NTFY\fR, \fB\)SHOULD\fR be sent with sequenced delivery to ensure
ordering.  All MGMT, ASPSM and RKM messages, with the exception of
\fI\)BEAT\fR, \fI\)BEAT ACK\fR and \fI\)NTFY\fR messages \fB\)MUST\fR be sent
on SCTP stream '0'.  ASPTM messages \fB\)MAY\fR be sent on one of the streams
used to carry data traffic related to the Routing Context(s), to minimize
possible message loss.  \fI\)BEAT\fR, \fI\)BEAT ACK\fR, and \fI\)NTFY\fR
messages \fB\)MAY\fR be sent using out-of-order delivery, and \fB\)MAY\fR be
sent on any stream.
.sh 2 "AS and ASP State Maintenance"
.pp
The TUA layer on the SGP maintains the state of each remote ASP, in each
Application Server that the ASP is configured to receive traffic, as input to
the TUA message distribution function.  Similarly, where IPSPs use TUA in a
point-to-point fashion, the TUA layer in an IPSP maintains the state of remote
IPSPs.
.pp
Two IPSP models are defined with regards to the number of messages that are
needed to an IPSP state change.  They are defined as follows:
.np
IPSP Single Exchange (SP) model.  Only a single exchange of ASPTM or ASPSM
messages is needed to change the IPSP state.  This means that a request from
one end and an acknowledgment from the other will be enough.
.\"This configuration requires static RK configuration.
.np
IPSP Double Exchange (DE) model.  Both IPSPs have to send request messages and
both IPSPs have to acknowledge the request messages from the other end.  This
results in a double exchange of ASPTM and ASPSM messages, one from each end.
.\"This configuration supports dynamic routing key configuration by using RKM
.\"messages in the same way as ASP-SGP scenario.
.pp
To ensure interoperability, a TUA implementation supporting IPSP communication
\fB\)MUST\fR support the IPSP SE model and \fB\)MAY\fR implement the IPSP DE
model.
.pp
In section 4.3.1, only the SGP-ASP and IPSP SE scenarios are described.  For
the IPSP DE model, both IPSPs \fB\)MUST\fR follow the SGP side of the SGP-ASP
procedures.
.pp
In section 4.3.2, only the SGP-ASP scenario is described.  All of the
procedures referring to an AS served by ASPs are also applicable to AS server
by IPSPs.
.pp
In section 4.3.3, only the Management procedures for the SGP-ASP scenario are
described.  The corresponding Management procedures for IPSPs are directly
inferred.
.pp
The remaining sections contain specific \fI\)IPSP Considerations\fR
subsections.
.sh 3 "ASP/IPSP States"
.pp
The state of each remote ASP/IPSP, in each AS that it is configured to operate, is
maintained in the TUA layer (i.e. in the SGP or peer IPSP, respectively).  The
state of a particular ASP/IPSP in a particular AS changes due to events.  The
events include:
.bu
reception of messages from the peer TUA layer at the ASP/IPSP;
.bu
reception of some messages from the peer TUA layer at other ASPs/IPSPs in the
AS (e.g, ASP Active message indicating "Override");
.bu
reception of indications from the SCTP layer; or,
.bu
Local Management intervention.

The ASP/IPSP state transition diagram is shown in \fI\*(&f\n(&p\fR.  The possible
states of an ASP/IPSP are:
.ip "ASP-DOWN:" 14
The remote TUA peer at the ASP/IPSP is unavailable or the related SCTP
association is down.  Initially all ASPs/IPSPs will be in this state.  An
ASP/IPSP in this state \fB\)SHOULD NOT\fR be sent any TUA messages, with the
exception of \fI\)Heartbeat (BEAT)\fR, \fI\)ASP Down Ack (ASPDN ACK)\fR and
\fI\)Error (ERR)\fR messages.
.ip "ASP-INACTIVE:" 14
The remote TUA peer at the ASP/IPSP is available (and the related SCTP
association is up) but application traffic is stopped.  In this state, the
ASP/IPSP \fB\)SHOULD NOT\fR be sent any DH, CH or SSNM messages for the AS for
which the ASP/IPSP is inactive.
.ip "ASP-ACTIVE:" 14
The remote TUA peer at the ASP/IPSP is available and application traffic is active
(for a particular Routing Context or set of Routing Contexts).
.ip "SCTP CDI:" 14
The SCTP CDI denotes the local SCTP layer's Communication Down Indication to
the Upper Layer Protocol (TUA) on an SGP.  The local SCTP layer will send this
indication when it detects the loss of connectivity to the ASPs peer SCTP
layer.  SCTP CDI is understood as either a SHUTDOWN_COMPLETE notification or
COMMUNICATION_LOST notification from the SCTP layer.
.ip "SCTP RI:" 14
The local SCTP layer's Restart indication to the upper layer protocol (TUA) on
an SG.  The local SCTP will send this indication when it detects a restart
from the ASPs peer SCTP layer.
.sh 3 "AS States"
.pp
The state of the AS is maintained in the TUA layer on the SGP.  The state of
an AS changes due to events.  These events include:
.bu
ASP state transitions
.bu
Recovery timer triggers
.pp
The possible states of an AS are:
.ip "AS-DOWN:" 14
The Application Server is unavailable.  This state implies that all related
ASPs are in the ASP-DOWN state for this AS.  Initially the AS will be in this
state.  An Application Server is in the AS-DOWN state when it is removed from
a configuration.
.ip "AS-INACTIVE:" 14
The Application Server is available but no application traffic is active
(i.e., one or more related ASPs are in the ASP-INACTIVE state, but none in the
ASP-ACTIVE state).  The recovery timer T(r) is not running or has expired.
.ip "AS-ACTIVE:" 14
The Application Server is available and application traffic is active.  This
state implies that at least one ASP is in the ASP-ACTIVE state.
.ip "AS-PENDING:" 14
An active ASP has transitioned to ASP-INACTIVE or ASP-DOWN and it was the last
remaining active ASP in the AS.  A recovery timer T(r) \fB\)SHOULD\fR be
started and all incoming signalling messages \fB\)SHOULD\fR be queued by the
SGP.  If an ASP becomes ASP-ACTIVE before T(r) expires, the AS is moved to the
AS-ACTIVE state and all the queued messages will be sent to the ASP.
.pp
If T(r) expires before an ASP becomes ASP-ACTIVE, and the SGP has no other
alternative, the SGP may stop queuing messages and discard all previously
queued messages.  The AS will move to the AS-INACTIVE state if at least one
ASP is in ASP-INACTIVE state, otherwise it will move to AS-DOWN state.

\fI\*(&f\n(&p\fR shows an example AS state machine for the case where the AS
data is pre-configured.  For other cases where the ASP configuration data is
created dynamically, there would be differences in the state machine,
especially at creation of the AS.
.pp
For example, where the AS configuration data is not created until Registration
of the first ASP, the AS-INACTIVE state is entered directly upon the first
successful REG REQ from an ASP.  Another example is where the AS configuration
data is not created until the first ASP successfully enters the ASP-ACTIVE
state.  In this case the AS-ACTIVE state is entered directly.
.sh 4 "IPSP Considerations"
.pp
The AS state diagram for the AS-SG case is applicable for IPSP communication.
.sh 3 "TUA Management Procedures for Primitives"
.pp
Before the establishment of an SCTP association the ASP state at both the SGP
and ASP is assumed to be in the state ASP-DOWN.
.pp
Once the SCTP association is established (see Section 4.2.1) and assuming that
the local TC-User is ready, the local TUA ASP Maintenance (ASPM) function will
initiate the relevant procedures, using the ASP Up, ASP Down, ASP Active and
ASP Inactive messages to convey the ASP state to the SGP (see Section 4.3.4).
.pp
If the TUA layer subsequently receives an SCTP-COMMUNICATION_DOWN or
SCTP-RESTART indication primitive from the underlying SCTP layer, it will
inform the Layer Management by invoking the M-SCTP_STATUS indication
primitive.  The state of the ASP will be moved to ASP-DOWN.
.pp
At an ASP, the TC-User will be informed of the unavailability of any affected
SS7 destination through the use of N-PCSTATE indication primitives.
.pp
In the case of SCTP-COMMUNICATION_DOWN, the SCTP client \fB\)MAY\fR try to
re-establish the SCTP association.  This \fB\)MAY\fR be done by the TUA layer
automatically, or Layer Management \fB\)MAY\fR re-establish using the M-
SCTP_ESTABLISH request primitive.
.pp
In the case of an SCTP-RESTART indication at an ASP, the ASP is now considered
by its TUA peer to be in the ASP-DOWN state.  The ASP, if it is to recover,
must begin any recovery with the ASP-Up procedure.
.sh 3 "ASPM Procedures for Peer-to-Peer Messages"
.sh 4 "ASP Up Procedures"
.pp
After an ASP has successfully established an SCTP association to an SGP, the
SGP waits for the ASP to send an \fI\)ASP Up (ASPUP)\fR message, indicating
that the ASP TUA peer is available.  The ASP is always the initiator of the
\fI\)ASP Up (ASPUP)\fR message.  This action \fB\)MAY\fR be initiated at the
ASP by an M-ASP_UP request primitive from Layer Management or \fB\)MAY\fR be
initiated automatically by an TUA management function.
.pp
When an \fI\)ASP Up (ASPUP)\fR message is received at an SGP and internally
the remote ASP is in the ASP-DOWN state and not considered locked-out for
local management reasons, the SGP marks the remote ASP in the state
ASP-INACTIVE and informs Layer Management with an M-ASP_Up indication
primitive.  If the SGP is aware, via current configuration data, which
Application Servers the ASP is configured to operate in, the SGP updates the
ASP state to ASP-INACTIVE in each AS that it is a member.
.pp
Alternatively, the SGP may move the ASP into a pool of Inactive ASPs available
for future configuration within Application Server(s), determined in a
subsequent Registration Request or ASP Active procedure.  If the \fI\)ASP Up
(ASPUP)\fR message contains an ASP Identifier, the SGP should save the ASP
Identifier for that ASP.  The SGP \fB\)MUST\fR send an \fI\)ASP Up Ack (ASPUP
ACK)\fR message in response to a received \fI\)ASP Up (ASPUP)\fR message even
if the ASP is already marked as ASP-INACTIVE at the SGP.
.pp
If for any local reason (e.g, management lock-out) the SGP cannot respond with
an \fI\)ASP Up Ack (ASPUP ACK)\fR message, the SGP responds to an \fI\)ASP Up
(ASPUP)\fR message with an \fI\)Error (ERR)\fR message with Reason "Refused -
Management Blocking".
.pp
At the ASP, the \fI\)ASP Up Ack (ASPUP ACK)\fR message received is not
acknowledged.  Layer Management is informed with an M-ASP_UP confirm
primitive.
.pp
When the ASP sends an \fI\)ASP Up (ASPUP)\fR message it starts timer T(ack).
If the ASP does not receive a response to an \fI\)ASP Up (ASPUP)\fR message
within T(ack), the ASP \fB\)MAY\fR restart T(ack) and resend \fI\)ASP Up
(ASPUP)\fR messages until it receives an \fI\)ASP Up Ack (ASPUP ACK)\fR
message.  T(ack) is provisionable, with a default of 2 seconds.
Alternatively, retransmission of \fI\)ASP Up (ASPUP)\fR messages \fB\)MAY\fR
be put under control of Layer Management.  In this method, expiry of T(ack)
results in an M-ASP_UP confirm primitive carrying a negative indication.
.pp
The ASP must wait for the \fI\)ASP Up Ack (ASPUP ACK)\fR message before
sending any other TUA messages (e.g, ASP Active or REG REQ).  If the SGP
receives any other TUA messages before \fI\)ASPUP\fR message is received
(other than ASPDN - see Section 4.3.4.2), the SGP \fB\)SHOULD\fR discard them.
.pp
If an \fI\)ASP Up (ASPUP)\fR message is received and internally the remote ASP
is in the ASP-ACTIVE state, an \fI\)ASP Up Ack (ASPUP ACK)\fR message is
returned, as well as an \fI\)Error (ERR)\fR message ("Unexpected Message), and
the remote ASP state is changed to ASP-INACTIVE in all relevant Application
Servers.
.pp
If an \fI\)ASP Up (ASPUP)\fR message is received and internally the remote ASP
is already in the ASP-INACTIVE state, an \fI\)ASP Up Ack (ASPUP ACK)\fR
message is returned and no further action is taken.
.sh 5 "TUA Version Control"
.pp
If an \fI\)ASP Up (ASPUP)\fR message with an unsupported version is received,
the receiving end responds with an \fI\)Error (ERR)\fR message, indicating the
version the receiving node supports and notifies Layer Management.
.pp
This is useful when protocol version upgrades are being performed in a
network.  A node upgraded to a newer version should support the older versions
used on other nodes it is communicating with.  Because ASPs initiate the ASP
Up procedure it is assumed that the \fI\)Error (ERR)\fR message would normally
come from the SGP.
.sh 5 "IPSP Considerations"
.pp
An IPSP may be considered in the ASP-INACTIVE state after and ASPUP or ASPUP
Ack has been received from it.  An IPSP can be considered in the ASP-DOWN
state after an ASPDN or ASPDN Ack has been received from it.  The IPSP may
inform Layer Management of the change in state of the remote IPSP using
M-ASP_UP or M-ASP_DN indication or confirmation primitives.
.pp
Alternatively, when using the IPSP DE model, an interchange of \fI\)ASPUP\fR
messages from each end \fB\)MUST\fR be performed.  Four messages are needed
for completion.
.pp
If for any local reason (e.g, management lock-out) and IPSP cannot respond to
an \fI\)ASP Up (ASPUP)\fR message with an \fI\)ASP Up Ack (ASPUP ACK)\fR
message, it responds to an \fI\)ASP Up (ASPUP)\fR message with an \fI\)Error
(ERR)\fR message with Reason "Refused - Management Blocking" and leaves the
remote IPSP in the ASP-DOWN state.
.sh 4 "ASP Down Procedures"
.pp
The ASP will send an \fI\)ASP Down (ASPDN)\fR message to an SGP when the ASP
wishes to be removed from service in all Application Servers that it is a
member and no longer receive any DH, CH, SSNM or ASPTM messages.  This action
\fB\)MAY\fR be initiated at the ASP by an M-ASP_DOWN request primitive from
Layer Management or \fB\)MAY\fR be initiated automatically by an TUA
management function.
.pp
Whether the ASP is permanently removed from any AS is a function of
configuration management.  Whenever the ASP previously used the Registration
procedures (see Section 4.4.1) to register within Application Servers but has
not deregistered from all of them prior to sending the \fI\)ASP Down
(ASPDN)\fR message, the SGP \fB\)MUST\fR consider the ASP as Deregistered in
all Application Servers that it is still a member.
.pp
The SGP marks the ASP as ASP-DOWN, informs Layer Management with an M-ASP_Down
indication primitive, and returns an \fI\)ASP Down Ack (ASPDN ACK)\fR message
to the ASP.
.pp
The SGP \fB\)MUST\fR send an \fI\)ASP Down Ack (ASPDN ACK)\fR message in
response to a received \fI\)ASP Down (ASPDN)\fR message from the ASP even if
the ASP is already marked as ASP-DOWN at the SGP.
.pp
At the ASP, the \fI\)ASP Down Ack (ASPDN ACK)\fR message received is not
acknowledged.  Layer Management is informed with an M-ASP_DOWN confirm
primitive.  If the ASP receives an ASP Down Ack without having sent an
\fI\)ASP Down (ASPDN)\fR message, the ASP should now consider itself as in the
ASP-DOWN state.  If the ASP was previously in the ASP-ACTIVE or ASP_INACTIVE
state, the ASP should then initiate procedures to return itself to its
previous state.
.pp
When the ASP sends an \fI\)ASP Down (ASPDN)\fR message it starts timer T(ack).
If the ASP does not receive a response to an \fI\)ASP Down (ASPDN)\fR message
within T(ack), the ASP \fB\)MAY\fR restart T(ack) and resend \fI\)ASP Down
(ASPDN)\fR messages until it receives an \fI\)ASP Down Ack (ASPDN ACK)\fR
message.  T(ack) is provisionable, with a default of 2 seconds.
Alternatively, retransmission of \fI\)ASP Down (ASPDN)\fR messages \fB\)MAY\fR
be put under control of Layer Management.  In this method, expiry of T(ack)
results in an M-ASP_DOWN confirm primitive carrying a negative indication.
.sh 4 "ASP Active Procedures"
.pp
Anytime after the ASP has received an \fI\)ASP Up Ack (ASPUP ACK)\fR message
from the SGP or IPSP, the ASP \fB\)MAY\fR send an \fI\)ASP Active (ASPAC)\fR
message to the SGP indicating that the ASP is ready to start processing
traffic.  This action \fB\)MAY\fR be initiated at the ASP by an M-ASP_ACTIVE
request primitive from Layer Management or \fB\)MAY\fR be initiated
automatically by an TUA management function.  Whenever an ASP wishes to
process the traffic for more than one Application Server across a common SCTP
association, the \fI\)ASP Active (ASPAC)\fR message(s) \fB\)SHOULD\fR contain
a list of one or more Routing Contexts to indicate for which Application
Servers the \fI\)ASP Active (ASPAC)\fR message applies.  It is not necessary
for the ASP to include all Routing Contexts of interest in a single \fI\)ASP
Active (ASPAC)\fR message, thus requesting to become active in all Routing
Contexts at the same time.  Multiple \fI\)ASP Active (ASPAC)\fR messages
\fB\)MAY\fR be used to activate within the Application Servers independently,
or in sets.  Whenever an \fI\)ASP Active (ASPAC)\fR message does not contain a
Routing Context parameter, the receiver must know, via configuration data,
which Application Server(s) the ASP is a member.
.pp
For the Application Servers that the ASP can successfully activate, the SGP or
IPSP responds with one or more \fI\)ASP Active Ack (ASPAC ACK)\fR messages,
including the associated Routing Context(s) and reflecting any Traffic Mode
Type values present in the related \fI\)ASP Active (ASPAC)\fR message.  The
Routing Context parameter \fB\)MUST\fR be included in the \fI\)ASP Active Ack
(ASPAC ACK)\fR message(s) if the received \fI\)ASP Active (ASPAC)\fR message
contained any Routing Contexts.  Depending on any Traffic Mode Type request in
the \fI\)ASP Active (ASPAC)\fR message or local configuration data if there is
no request, the SGP moves the ASP to the correct ASP traffic state within the
associated Application Server(s).  Layer Management is informed with an
M-ASP_Active indication.  If the SGP or IPSP receives any DH or CH messages
before an \fI\)ASP Active (ASPAC)\fR message is received, the SGP or IPSP
\fB\)MAY\fR discard them.  By sending an \fI\)ASP Active Ack (ASPAC ACK)\fR
message, the SGP or IPSP is now ready to receive and send traffic for the
related Routing Context(s).  The ASP \fB\)SHOULD NOT\fR send DH or CH messages
for the related Routing Context(s) before receiving an \fI\)ASP Active Ack
(ASPAC ACK)\fR message, or it will risk message loss.
.pp
Multiple \fI\)ASP Active Ack (ASPAC ACK)\fR messages \fB\)MAY\fR be used in
response to an \fI\)ASP Active (ASPAC)\fR message containing multiple Routing
Contexts, allowing the SGP or IPSP to independently acknowledge the \fI\)ASP
Active (ASPAC)\fR message for different (sets of) Routing Contexts.  The SGP
or IPSP \fB\)MUST\fR send an \fI\)Error (ERR)\fR message ("Invalid Routing
Context") for each Routing Context value that cannot be successfully
activated.
.pp
Whenever an "out-of-the-blue" \fI\)ASP Active (ASPAC\fR message is received
(i.e., the ASP has not registered with the SG or the SG has no static
configuration data for the ASP), the message \fB\)MAY\fR be silently
discarded.
.pp
The SGP \fB\)MUST\fR send an \fI\)ASP Active Ack (ASPAC ACK)\fR message in
response to a received \fI\)ASP Active (ASPAC)\fR message from the ASP, if the
ASP is already marked in the ASP-ACTIVE state at the SGP.
.pp
At the ASP, the \fI\)ASP Active Ack (ASPAC ACK)\fR message received is not
acknowledged.  Layer Management is informed with an M-ASP_ACTIVE confirm
primitive.  It is possible for the ASP to receive DH or CH message(s) before
the \fI\)ASP Active Ack (ASPAC ACK)\fR message as the ASP Active Ack and DH or
CH messages from an SG or IPSP may be sent on different SCTP streams.  Message
loss is possible, as the ASP does not consider itself in the ASP-ACTIVE state
until reception of the \fI\)ASP Active Ack (ASPAC ACK)\fR message.
.pp
When the ASP sends an \fI\)ASP Active (ASPAC)\fR message it starts timer
T(ack).  If the ASP does not receive a response to an \fI\)ASP Active
(ASPAC)\fR message within T(ack), the ASP \fB\)MAY\fR restart T(ack) and
resend \fI\)ASP Active (ASPAC)\fR messages until it receives an \fI\)ASP
Active Ack (ASPAC ACK)\fR message.  T(ack) is provisionable, with a default of
2 seconds.  Alternatively, retransmission of \fI\)ASP Active (ASPAC)\fR
messages \fB\)MAY\fR be put under control of Layer Management.  In this
method, expiry of T(ack) results in an M-ASP_ACTIVE confirm primitive carrying
a negative indication.
.pp
There are three modes of Application Server traffic handling in the SGP TUA
layer: Override, Load-share and Broadcast.  When included, the Traffic Mode
Type parameter in the \fI\)ASP Active (ASPAC)\fR message indicates the
traffic-handling mode to be used in a particular Application Server.  If the
SGP determines that the mode indicated in an \fI\)ASP Active (ASPAC)\fR
message is unsupported or incompatible with the mode currently configured for
the AS, the SGP responds with an \fI\)Error (ERR)\fR message
("Unsupported/Invalid Traffic Handling Mode").  If the traffic- handling mode
of the Application Server is not already known via configuration data, then
the traffic-handling mode indicated in the first \fI\)ASP Active (ASPAC)\fR
message causing the transition of the Application Server state to AS-ACTIVE
\fB\)MAY\fR be used to set the mode.
.pp
In the case of an Override mode AS, reception of an \fI\)ASP Active (ASPAC)\fR
message at an SGP causes the (re)direction of all traffic for the AS to the
ASP that sent the \fI\)ASP Active (ASPAC)\fR message.  Any previously active
ASP in the AS is now considered to be in state ASP-INACTIVE and \fB\)SHOULD\fR
no longer receive traffic from the SGP within the AS.  The SGP or IPSP then
\fB\)MUST\fR send a \fI\)Notify (NTFY)\fR message ("Alternate ASP Active") to
the previously active ASP in the AS, and \fB\)SHOULD\fR stop traffic to or
from that ASP.  The ASP receiving this Notify \fB\)MUST\fR consider itself now
in the ASP-INACTIVE state, if it is not already aware of this via inter- ASP
communication with the Overriding ASP.
.pp
In the case of a Load-share mode AS, reception of an \fI\)ASP Active
(ASPAC)\fR message at an SGP or IPSP causes the direction of traffic to the
ASP sending the \fI\)ASP Active (ASPAC)\fR message, in addition to all the
other ASPs that are currently active in the AS.  The algorithm at the SGP for
load-sharing traffic within an AS to all the active ASPs is implementation
dependent.  The algorithm could, for example, be round robin or based on
information in the DH or CH  message.
.pp
An SGP or IPSP, upon reception of an \fI\)ASP Active (ASPAC)\fR message for
the first ASP in a Load-share AS, \fB\)MAY\fR choose not to direct traffic to
a newly active ASP until it determines that there are sufficient resources to
handle the expected load (e.g, until there are "n" ASPs in state ASP-ACTIVE in
the AS).
.pp
All ASPs within a load-sharing mode AS must be able to process any DH or CH
message received for the AS, to accommodate any potential fail-over or
re-balancing of the offered load.
.pp
In the case of a Broadcast mode AS, reception of an \fI\)ASP Active (ASPAC)\fR
message at an SGP or IPSP causes the direction of traffic to the ASP sending
the \fI\)ASP Active (ASPAC)\fR message, in addition to all the other ASPs that
are currently active in the AS.  The algorithm at the SGP for broadcasting
traffic within an AS to all the active ASPs is a simple broadcast algorithm,
where every message is sent to each of the active ASPs.  An SGP or IPSP, upon
reception of an \fI\)ASP Active (ASPAC)\fR message for the first ASP in a
Broadcast AS, \fB\)MAY\fR choose not to direct traffic to a newly active ASP
until it determines that there are sufficient resources to handle the expected
load (e.g, until there are "n" ASPs in state ASP-ACTIVE in the AS).
.pp
Whenever an ASP in a Broadcast mode AS becomes ASP-ACTIVE, the SGP
\fB\)MUST\fR tag the first DH or CH message broadcast in each SCTP stream with
a unique Correlation Id parameter.  The purpose of this Correlation Id is to
permit the newly active ASP to synchronize it's processing of traffic in each
ordered stream with the other ASPs in the broadcast group.
.sh 5 "IPSP Considerations"
.pp
Either of the IPSPs can initiate communication.  When an IPSP receives an ASP
Active, it should mark the peer as ASP-ACTIVE and return an \fI\)ASP Active
Ack (ASPAC ACK)\fR message.  An ASP receiving an \fI\)ASP Active Ack (ASPAC
ACK)\fR message may mark the peer as ASP-Active, if it is not already in the
ASP- ACTIVE state.
.pp
Alternatively, when using the IPSP DE model, an interchange of \fI\)ASPAC\fR
messages from each end \fB\)MUST\fR be performed.  Four messages are needed
for completion.
.sh 4 "ASP Inactive Procedures"
.pp
When an ASP wishes to withdraw from receiving traffic within an AS, or the
ASP wants to initiate the process of deactivation, the ASP sends an
\fI\)ASP Inactive (ASPIA)\fR message to the SGP or IPSP.
.pp
An \fI\)ASP Inactive (ASPIA)\fR message \fB\)MUST\fR always be responded by
the peer (although other messages may be sent in the middle):
.bu
If the corresponding RK is registered (statically or dynamically), the peer
should respond with an \fI\)ASP Inactive Ack (ASPIA Ack)\fR message.
.bu
If the RK is not registered, or the RC information is not valid, the peer must
respond with an \fI\)Error (ERR)\fR message with error code "Invalid Routing
Context".
.bu
If the RC is missing and its specification is needed according to the used
configuration, the peer must respond with an \fI\)Error (ERR)\fR message with
error code "No Configured AS for ASP".
.pp
The action of sending the \fI\)ASP Inactive (ASPIA)\fR message \fB\)MAY\fR be
initiated at the ASP by an M-ASP_INACTIVE request primitive from Layer
Management or \fB\)MAY\fR be initiated automatically by an TUA management
function.  Whenever an ASP is processing the traffic for more than one
Application Server across a common SCTP association, the \fI\)ASP Inactive
(ASPIA)\fR message contains one or more Routing Contexts to indicate for which
Application Servers the \fI\)ASP Inactive (ASPIA)\fR message applies.
Whenever an \fI\)ASP Inactive (ASPIA)\fR message does not contain a Routing
Context parameter, the receiver must know, via configuration data, which
Application Servers the ASP is a member and move the ASP to the ASP-INACTIVE
state in each all Application Servers.
.pp
In the case of an Override mode AS, where another ASP has already taken over
the traffic within the AS with an \fI\)ASP Active (ASPAC)\fR message, the ASP
that sends the \fI\)ASP Inactive (ASPIA)\fR message is already considered by
the SGP to be in state ASP-INACTIVE.  An \fI\)ASP Inactive Ack (ASPIA ACK)\fR
message is sent to the ASP, after ensuring that all traffic is stopped to the
ASP.
.pp
In the case of a Load-share mode AS, the SGP moves the ASP to the ASP-INACTIVE
state and the AS traffic is re-allocated across the remaining ASPs in the
state ASP-ACTIVE, as per the load-sharing algorithm currently used within the
AS.  A \fI\)Notify (NTFY)\fR message ("Insufficient ASP resources active in
AS") \fB\)MAY\fR be sent to all inactive ASPs, if required.  An \fI\)ASP
Inactive Ack (ASPIA ACK)\fR message is sent to the ASP after all traffic is
halted and Layer Management is informed with an M-ASP_INACTIVE indication
primitive.
.pp
In the case of a Broadcast mode AS, the SGP moves the ASP to the ASP- INACTIVE
state and the AS traffic is broadcast only to the remaining ASPs in the state
ASP-ACTIVE.  A \fI\)Notify (NTFY)\fR message ("Insufficient ASP resources
active in AS") \fB\)MAY\fR be sent to all inactive ASPs, if required.  An
\fI\)ASP Inactive Ack (ASPIA ACK)\fR message is sent to the ASP after all
traffic is halted and Layer Management is informed with an M-ASP_INACTIVE
indication primitive.
.pp
Multiple \fI\)ASP Inactive Ack (ASPIA ACK)\fR messages \fB\)MAY\fR be used in
response to an \fI\)ASP Inactive (ASPIA)\fR message containing multiple
Routing Contexts, allowing the SGP or IPSP to independently acknowledge for
different (sets of) Routing Contexts.  The SGP or IPSP sends an \fI\)Error
(ERR)\fR ("Invalid Routing Context") message for each invalid or not
configured Routing Context value in a received \fI\)ASP Inactive (ASPIA)\fR
message.
.pp
The SGP \fB\)MUST\fR send an \fI\)ASP Inactive Ack (ASPIA ACK)\fR message in
response to a received \fI\)ASP Inactive (ASPIA)\fR message from the ASP and
the ASP is already marked as ASP-INACTIVE at the SGP.
.pp
At the ASP, the \fI\)ASP Inactive Ack (ASPIA ACK)\fR message received is not
acknowledged.  Layer Management is informed with an M-ASP_INACTIVE confirm
primitive.  If the ASP receives an ASP Inactive Ack without having sent an
\fI\)ASP Inactive (ASPIA)\fR message, the ASP should now consider itself as in
the ASP-INACTIVE state.  If the ASP was previously in the ASP-ACTIVE state,
the ASP should then initiate procedures to return itself to its previous
state.  When the ASP sends an \fI\)ASP Inactive (ASPIA)\fR message it starts
timer T(ack).  If the ASP does not receive a response to an \fI\)ASP Inactive
(ASPIA)\fR message within T(ack), the ASP \fB\)MAY\fR restart T(ack) and
resend \fI\)ASP Inactive (ASPIA)\fR messages until it receives an \fI\)ASP
Inactive Ack (ASPIA ACK)\fR message.  T(ack) is provisionable, with a default
of 2 seconds.  Alternatively, retransmission of \fI\)ASP Inactive (ASPIA)\fR
messages \fB\)MAY\fR be put under control of Layer Management.  In this
method, expiry of T(ack) results in a M-ASP_Inactive confirm primitive
carrying a negative indication.
.pp
If no other ASPs in the Application Server are in the state ASP- ACTIVE, the
SGP \fB\)MUST\fR send a \fI\)Notify (NTFY)\fR message ("AS-Pending") to all of
the ASPs in the AS which are in the state ASP-INACTIVE.  The SGP
\fB\)SHOULD\fR start buffering the incoming messages for T(r) seconds, after
which messages \fB\)MAY\fR be discarded.  T(r) is configurable by the network
operator.  If the SGP receives an \fI\)ASP Active (ASPAC)\fR message from an
ASP in the AS before expiry of T(r), the buffered traffic is directed to that
ASP and the timer is canceled.  If T(r) expires, the AS is moved to the
AS-INACTIVE state.
.sh 5 "IPSP Considerations"
.pp
An IPSP may be considered in the ASP-INACTIVE state by a remote IPSP after an
ASP Inactive or \fI\)ASP Inactive Ack (ASPIA ACK)\fR message has been received
from it.
.pp
Alternatively, when using the IPSP DE model, an interchange of \fI\)ASPIA\fR
messages from each end \fB\)MUST\fR be performed.  Four messages are needed
for completion.
.sh 4 "Notify Procedures"
.pp
A \fI\)Notify (NTFY)\fR message reflecting a change in the AS state
\fB\)MUST\fR be sent to all ASPs in the AS, except those in the ASP-DOWN
state, with appropriate Status Information and any ASP Identifier of the
failed ASP.  At the ASP, Layer Management is informed with an M-NOTIFY
indication primitive.  The \fI\)Notify (NTFY)\fR message must be sent whether
the AS state change was a result of an ASP failure or reception of an ASP
State management (ASPSM) or ASP Traffic Management (ASPTM) message.  In the
second case, the \fI\)Notify (NTFY)\fR message \fB\)MUST\fR be sent after any
ASP State or Traffic Management related acknowledgments messages (e.g, ASP Up
Ack, ASP Down Ack, ASP Active Ack, or ASP Inactive Ack).
.pp
Whenever a \fI\)Notify (NTFY)\fR ("AS-PENDING") message is sent by an SGP that
now has no ASPs active to service the traffic, or where a \fI\)Notify NTFY\fR
("Insufficient ASP resources active in AS") message \fB\)MUST\fR be sent in
the Load-share or Broadcast mode, the \fI\)Notify (NTFY)\fR message does not
explicitly compel the ASP(s) receiving the message to become active.  The ASPs
remain in control of what (and when) traffic action is taken.
.pp
Whenever a \fI\)Notify (NTYF)\fR message does not contain a Routing Context
parameter, the receiver must know, via configuration data, of which
Application Servers the ASP is a member and take the appropriate action in
each AS.
.sh 5 "IPSP Considerations (NTFY)"
.pp
Notify works in the same manner as in the SG-AS case.  One of the IPSPs can
send this message to any remote IPSP that is not in the ASP-DOWN state.
.sh 4 "Heartbeat Procedures"
.pp
The optional Heartbeat procedures \fB\)MAY\fR be used when operating over
transport layers that do not have their own heartbeat mechanism for detecting
loss of the transport association (i.e., other than SCTP).
.pp
Either TUA peer may optionally send \fI\)Heartbeat (BEAT)\fR messages periodically, subject
to a provisionable timer T(beat).  Upon receiving a \fI\)Heartbeat (BEAT)\fR message, the TUA
peer \fB\)MUST\fR respond with a \fI\)Heartbeat Ack (BEAT ACK)\fR message.
.pp
If no \fI\)Heartbeat Ack (BEAT ACK)\fR message (or any other TUA message) is received from the
TUA peer within 2*T(beat), the remote TUA peer is considered unavailable.
Transmission of \fI\)Heartbeat (BEAT)\fR messages is stopped and the signalling process
\fB\)SHOULD\fR attempt to re-establish communication if it is configured as
the client for the disconnected TUA peer.
.pp
The \fI\)Heartbeat (BEAT)\fR message may optionally contain an opaque Heartbeat Data
parameter that \fB\)MUST\fR be echoed back unchanged in the related \fI\)Heartbeat
Ack (BEAT ACK)\fR message.  The sender, upon examining the contents of the returned
\fI\)Heartbeat Ack (BEAT ACK)\fR message, \fB\)MAY\fR choose to consider the remote TUA peer as
unavailable.  The contents and format of the Heartbeat Data parameter is
implementation-dependent and only of local interest to the original sender.
The contents may be used, for example, to support a Heartbeat sequence
algorithm (to detect missing Heartbeats), or a time-stamp mechanism (to
evaluate delays).
.pp
Note: Heartbeat related events are not shown in \*[figure4] "ASP State Transition
Diagram".
.sh 2 "Routing Key Management Procedures"
.sh 3 "Registration"
.pp
An ASP \fB\)MAY\fR dynamically register with an SGP as an ASP within an
Application Server using the \fI\)REG REQ\fR message.  A Routing Key parameter in the
\fI\)REG REQ\fR message specifies the parameters associated with the Routing Key.

The SGP examines the contents of the received Routing Key parameter and
compares it with the currently provisioned Routing Keys.  If the received
Routing Key matches an existing SGP Routing Key entry, and the ASP is not
currently included in the list of ASPs for the related Application Server, the
SGP \fB\)MAY\fR authorize the ASP to be added to the AS.  Or, if the Routing
Key does not currently exist and the received Routing Key data is valid and
unique, an SGP supporting dynamic configuration \fB\)MAY\fR authorize the
creation of a new Routing Key and related Application Server and add the ASP
to the new AS.  In either case, the SGP returns a \fI\)Registration Response
(REG RSP)\fR message to the ASP, containing the same Local-RK-Identifier as
provided in the initial request, and a Registration Result "Successfully
Registered".  A unique Routing Context value assigned to the SGP Routing Key
is included.  The method of Routing Context value assignment at the SGP is
implementation dependent but must be guaranteed to be unique for each
Application Server or Routing Key supported by the SGP.   If the SGP
determines that the received Routing Key data is invalid, or contains invalid
parameter values, the SGP returns a \fI\)Registration Response (REG RSP)\fR
message to the ASP, containing a Registration Result "Error - Invalid Routing
Key", "Error - Invalid DPC", "Error - Invalid Network Appearance" as appropriate.
.pp
If the SGP does not support the registration procedure, the SGP returns an
\fI\)Error (ERR)\fR message to the ASP, with an error code of "Unsupported
Message Type".
.pp
If the SGP determines that a unique Routing Key cannot be created, the SGP
returns a \fI\)Registration Response (REG RSP)\fR message to the ASP, with a
Registration Status of "Error - "Cannot Support Unique Routing." An incoming
signalling message received at an SGP should not match against more than one
Routing Key.
.pp
If the SGP does not authorize the registration request, the SGP returns a
\fI\)REG RSP\fR message to the ASP containing the Registration Result "Error -
Permission Denied".
.pp
If an SGP determines that a received Routing Key does not currently exist and
the SGP does not support dynamic configuration, the SGP returns a
\fI\)Registration Response (REG RSP)\fR message to the ASP, containing a
Registration Result "Error - Routing Key not Currently Provisioned".
.pp
If an SGP determines that a received Routing Key does not currently exist and
the SGP supports dynamic configuration but does not have the capacity to add
new Routing Key and Application Server entries, the SGP returns a
\fI\)Registration Response (REG RSP)\fR message to the ASP, containing a
Registration Result "Error - Insufficient Resources".
.pp
If an SGP determines that one or more of the Routing Key parameters are not
supported for the purpose of creating new Routing Key entries, the SGP returns
a \fI\)Registration Response (REG RSP)\fR message to the ASP, containing a
Registration Result "Error - Unsupported RK parameter field".  This result
\fB\)MAY\fR be used if, for example, the SGP does not support RK Address
parameter.
.pp
A Registration Response "Error - Unsupported Traffic Handling Mode" is
returned if the Routing Key in the REG REQ contains a Traffic Handling Mode
that is inconsistent with the presently configured mode for the matching
Application Server.
.pp
An ASP \fB\)MAY\fR register multiple Routing Keys at once by including a
number of Routing Key parameters in a single \fI\)REG REQ\fR message.  The SGP
\fB\)MAY\fR respond to each registration request in a single \fI\)REG RSP\fR
message, indicating the success or failure result for each Routing Key in a
separate Registration Result parameter.  Alternatively the SGP \fB\)MAY\fR
respond with multiple \fI\)REG RSP\fR messages, each with one or more
Registration Result parameters.  The ASP uses the Local-RK-Identifier
parameter to correlate the requests with the responses.
.pp
An ASP \fB\)MAY\fR modify an existing Routing Key by including a Routing
Context parameter in the REG REQ.  If the SGP determines that the Routing
Context applies to an existing Routing Key, the SG \fB\)MAY\fR adjust the
existing Routing Key to match the new information provided in the Routing Key
parameter.  A Registration Response "Error - Routing Key Change Refused" is
returned if the SGP does not accept the modification of the Routing Key.
.pp
Upon successful registration of an ASP in an AS, the SGP can now send related
SS7 Signalling Network Management messaging, if this did not previously start
upon the ASP transition to state ASP-INACTIVE
.sh 3 "Deregistration"
.pp
An ASP \fB\)MAY\fR dynamically deregister with an SGP as an ASP within an
Application Server using the \fI\)DEREG REQ\fR message.  A Routing Context
parameter in the \fI\)DEREG REQ\fR  message specifies which Routing Keys to
deregister.  An ASP \fB\)SHOULD\fR move to the ASP-INACTIVE state for an
Application Server before attempting to deregister the Routing Key (i.e.,
deregister after receiving an ASP Inactive Ack).  Also, an ASP \fB\)SHOULD\fR
deregister from all Application Servers that it is a member before attempting
to move to the ASP-Down state.
.pp
The SGP examines the contents of the received Routing Context parameter and
validates that the ASP is currently registered in the Application Server(s)
related to the included Routing Context(s).  If validated, the ASP is
deregistered as an ASP in the related Application Server.
.pp
The deregistration procedure does not necessarily imply the deletion of
Routing Key and Application Server configuration data at the SGP.  Other ASPs
may continue to be associated with the Application Server, in which case the
Routing Key data \fB\)MUST NOT\fR be deleted.  If a Deregistration results in
no more ASPs in an Application Server, an SGP \fB\)MAY\fR delete the Routing
Key data.
.pp
The SGP acknowledges the deregistration request by returning a \fI\)DEREG
RSP\fR
message to the requesting ASP.  The result of the deregistration is found in
the Deregistration Result parameter, indicating success or failure with cause.
.pp
An ASP \fB\)MAY\fR deregister multiple Routing Contexts at once by including a
number of Routing Contexts in a single \fI\)DEREG REQ\fR message.  The SGP \fB\)MAY\fR
respond to each deregistration request in a single \fI\)DEREG RSP\fR message,
indicating the success or failure result for each Routing Context in a
separate Deregistration Result parameter.
.sh 3 "IPSP Considerations (REG/DEREG)"
.pp
The Registration and Deregistration procedures work in the IPSP cases in the
same way as in AS-SG cases.  An IPSP may register an RK in the remote IPSP.
An IPSP is responsible for deregistering the RKs that it has registered.
.sh 2 "Procedures to Support Point Code and Subsystem State"
.sh 3 "At an SGP"
.pp
On receiving an N-STATE, N-PCSTATE, N-COORD indication primitive from the
nodal inter-working function at an SGP, the SGP TUA layer will send a
corresponding SS7 Signalling Network Management (SSNM) DUNA, DAVA, DUPU, DRST
or \fI\)SCON\fR message (see Section 3) to the TUA peers at concerned ASPs.
The TUA layer must fill in various fields of the SSNM messages consistently
with the information received in the primitives.
.pp
SSNM messages \fB\)SHOULD NOT\fR be sent on stream "0" and \fB\)MAY\fR use
ordered delivery.
.sh 3 "At an ASP"
.sh 4 "Single SG Configurations"
.pp
At an ASP, upon receiving an SS7 Signalling Network Management (SSNM) message
from the remote TUA Peer, the TUA layer invokes the appropriate primitive
indications to the resident TC-Users.  Local management is informed.
.pp
Whenever a local event has caused the unavailability or congestion status of
SS7 destinations, user parts or subsystems, the TUA layer at the ASP
\fB\)SHOULD\fR pass up appropriate indications in the primitives to the TUA
User, as though equivalent SSNM messages were received.  For example, the loss
of an SCTP association to an SGP may cause the unavailability of a set of SS7
destinations, user parts or subsystems.  N-PCSTATE indication primitives to
the TUA User are appropriate.
.sh 4 "Multiple SG Configurations"
.pp
At an ASP, upon receiving a SS7 Signalling Network Management (SSNM) message
from the remote TUA Peer, the TUA layer updates the status of the affected
route(s) via the originating SG and determines, whether or not the overall
availability or congestion status of the effected destination(s) or
subsystem(s) has changed.  If so, the TUA layer invokes the appropriate
primitive indications to the resident TC-Users \*#.
.(d
.ip \*#
\fB\)IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:\-\fR\  To accomplish the handling of SSNM messages
from multiple SGs in a multiple SG configuration, the TUA layer at an ASP
maintains the status of routes via each SG.
.)d
Local management is informed.
.sh 3 "ASP Auditing"
.pp
An ASP may optionally initiate an audit procedure to inquire of an SG the
availability and, if the national congestion method with multiple congestion
levels and message priorities is used, congestion status of an SS7 destination
or set of destinations.  In addition, the ASP may inquire of an SG the
availability and congestion status of a subsystem.  A \fI\)Destination Audit (DAUD)\fR
message is sent from the ASP to the SGP requesting the current availability
and congestion status of one or more SS7 destinations or subsystems.
.lp
The \fI\)DAUD\fR message \fB\)MAY\fR be sent with unordered delivery.  The ASP
\fB\)MAY\fR send the DAUD in the following cases:
.ip "- Periodic:" 14
A Timer originally set upon reception of a \fI\)DUNA\fR, \fI\)SCON\fR or
\fI\)DRST\fR message has expired without a subsequent \fI\)DAVA\fR,
\fI\)DUNA\fR, \fI\)SCON\fR or \fI\)DRST\fR message updating the availability
and congestion status of the affected destinations or subsystems.  The Timer
is reset upon issuing a DAUD.  In this case the DAUD is sent to the SGP that
originally sent the SSNM message \*#.
.ip "- Isolation:" 14
The ASP is newly ASP-ACTIVE or has been isolated from an SG for an extended
period.  The ASP \fB\)MAY\fR request the availability and congestion status of
one or more SS7 destinations or subsystems to which it expects to communicate.
.(d
.ip \*#
\fB\)IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:\-\fR\  In the case of a Periodic audit, the auditing
procedure might not be invoked for the case of a received \fI\)SCON\fR message
containing a congestion level value of "no congestion" or undefined" (i.e.,
congestion Level = "0").  This is because the value indicates either
congestion abatement or that the ITU MTP3 international congestion method is
being used.  In the international congestion method, the MTP3 layer at the SGP
does not maintain the congestion status of any destinations and therefore the
SGP cannot provide any congestion information in response to the DAUD.  For
the same reason, in the second of the cases above a \fI\)DAUD\fR message
cannot reveal any congested destination(s).
.)d
.pp
The SGP \fB\)SHOULD\fR either respond to a \fI\)DAUD\fR messages with SSNM messages
indicating the availability and congestion status of the destination or
subsystem, or \fB\)SHOULD\fR respond with an \fI\)ERR\fR ("Destination Status
Unknown") or \fI\)ERR\fR ("Subsystem Status Unknown") message for each destination or
subsystem requested in the \fI\)DAUD\fR message.i
.pp
The status of each SS7 destination or subsystem requested is indicated in a
\fI\)DUNA\fR message (if unavailable), a \fI\)DAVA\fR message (if available), or a DRST (if
restricted and the SGP supports this feature).  If the SS7 destination or
subsystem is available and congested, the SGP responds with an \fI\)SCON\fR message in
addition to the \fI\)DAVA\fR message.  If the SS7 destination is restricted and
congested, the SGP responds with an \fI\)SCON\fR message in addition to the DRST.  If
the SGP cannot return information on the availability or congestion status of
the SS7 destination or subsystem, the SGP responds with an ERR ("Destination
Status Unknown") or ERR ("Subsystem Status Unknown") with a list of all the
destinations and subsystems for which the SGP cannot provide information.
.pp
In some cases, the SGP \fB\)MAY\fR chose not to respond to a \fI\)DAUD\fR message or a
component of a \fI\)DAUD\fR message on the basis of policy \*#.
.(d
.ip \*#
\fB\)IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:\-\fR\  For example, an SGP \fB\)MAY\fR chose to not
respond to a request for the destination or subsystem status of a specific
point code in the \fI\)DAUD\fR message because the ASP that issued the \fI\)DAUD\fR message is
not authorized to obtain information concerning the status of the destination
as requested.
.)d
.pp
Any \fI\)DUNA\fR or \fI\)DAVA\fR message in response to a \fI\)DAUD\fR message \fB\)MAY\fR contain a
list of Affected Point Codes.
.sh 3 "TCAP \- TUA Interworking at the SG"
.pp
On the SG, the TCAP routing or interworking function determines that the
message must be sent to an AS via the TUA stack, based on information in the
incoming message.  The TUA outgoing mapping function identifies the
appropriate Application Server (AS) and selects an active ASP from the list of
ASPs servicing this AS.  The appropriate ASP can be determined based on the
routing information in the incoming message, local load sharing information,
etc.  The appropriate TUA message is then constructed and sent to the
appropriate endpoint, via the correct SCTP association and stream.
.sh 4 "Primitives received from the local TC-User"
.pp
These support the TUA transport of TC-User boundary primitives.  The same
services as supported by TCAP are to be provided by TUA.  The TC-users at
the SG should be able to use the same primitive interface to TCAP/TUA without
any changes.  The TCAP-TUA interworking function takes care of selecting the
appropriate stack.
.pp
The TUA needs to setup and maintain the appropriate SCTP association to the
selected endpoint.  TUA also manages the usage of SCTP streams.  The address
information passed by the TUA-user at an ASP must contain: .np a valid SS7
address to reach a destination in the SS7 network via the appropriate SCTP
association to a SG .np a valid IP address or host name to reach another ASP in
the IP network via the appropriate SCTP association.
.sh 4 "Segmenting and Reassembly of Components"
.pp
When it is expected that TCAP signalling messages will not fit into the
maximum PDU size of the underlying transport (e.g, SCCP, MTP), then
segmentation and reassembly \fB\)SHOULD\fR be performed by the TC-User.  In
the event that the SG receives a \fI\)TQRY\fR, \fI\)TCNV\fR and \fI\)TRSP\fR message with included or
associated components that exceed the maximum PDU size of the underling
transport, the SGP will respond with a \fI\)TNOT\fR message with "Segmentation Not
Supported" or "Segmentation Failed" or "Destination cannot perform reassembly"
indicated in the \fI\)Report Cause\fR within the \fI\)TNOT\fR message considering
local SG SCCP procedures \*#.
.(d
.ip \*#
\fB\)IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:\-\fR\  Typically a TC-User is responsible for
performing the segmentation and reassembly of components.

.sh 2 "Signalling Network Architecture"
.pp
A Signalling Gateway is used to support the transport of TC-User signalling
traffic received from the SS7 network to multiple distributed ASPs (e.g., MGCs
and IP Databases).  Clearly, the TUA protocol is not designed to meet the
performance and reliability requirements for such transport by itself.
However, the conjunction of distributed architecture and redundant networks
provides support for reliable transport of signalling traffic over IP.  The
TUA protocol is flexible enough to allow its operation and management in a
variety of physical configurations, enabling Network Operators to meet their
performance and reliability requirements.
.pp
To meet the stringent SS7 signalling reliability and performance requirements
for carrier grade networks, Network Operators might require that no single
point of failure is present in the end-to-end network architecture between an
SS7 node and an IP-based application.  This can typically be achieved through
the use of redundant SGPs or SGs, redundant hosts, and the provision of
redundant QOS-bounded IP network paths for SCTP Associations between SCTP End
Points. Obviously, the reliability of the SG, the MGC and other IP-based
functional elements also needs to be taken into account.  The distribution of
ASPs and SGPs within the available Hosts MAY also be considered.  As an
example, for a particular Application Server, the related ASPs could be
distributed over at least two Hosts.
.pp
One example of a physical network architecture relevant to SS7 carrier-grade
operation in the IP network domain is shown in \fI\*(&f\n(&n\fR.

.#f "Physical Model"
.)b
.pp
In this model, each host MAY have many application processes.  In the case of
the MGC, an ASP may provide service to one or more Application Servers, and is
identified as an SCTP end point. One or more Signalling Gateway Processes make
up a single Signalling Gateway.
.pp
This example model can also be applied to IPSP-IPSP signalling.  In this case,
each IPSP MAY have its services distributed across 2 hosts or more, and may
have multiple server processes on each host.
.pp
In the example above, each signalling process (SGP, ASP or IPSP) is the end
point to more than one SCTP association, leading to more than one other
signalling processes.  To support this, a signalling process must be able to
support distribution of TUA messages to many simultaneous active
associations.  This message distribution function is based on the status of
provisioned Routing Keys, the status of the signalling routes to signalling
points in the SS7 network , and the redundancy model (override, load-sharing,
broadcast) of the remote signalling processes.
.pp
For carrier grade networks, the failure or isolation of a particular
signalling process should not cause transactions to be lost.  This implies
that signalling processes need, in some cases, to share the transaction state
or be able to pass the transaction state information between each other.
However, this sharing or communication of transaction state information is
outside the scope of this document.
.pp
This model serves as an example.  TUA imposes no restrictions as to the exact
layout of the network elements, the message distribution algorithms and the
distribution of the signalling processes.  Instead, it provides a framework
and a set of messages that allow for a flexible and scalable signalling
network architecture, aiming to provide reliability and performance.
.sh 2 "Redundancy Models"
.sh 3 "Application Server Redundancy"
.pp
At the SGP, an Application Server list contains active and inactive ASPs to
support ASP broadcast, load-sharing and override procedures.  The list of ASPs
within a logical Application Server is kept updated in the SGP to reflect the
active Application Server Processes.
.lp
For example, in the network shown in \fI\*(&f\n(&p\fR, all messages to SSN x
could be sent to ASP1 in Host3 or ASP1 in Host4.  The AS list at SGP1 in Host
1 might look like the following:
.ix +4
.TS
tab(:);
lsss
ll1c1l.
Routing Key {SSN=x) - "Application Server #1"
:ASP1/Host3:-:State = Active
:ASP1/Host4:-:State = Inactive
.TE
.pp
In this "1+1" redundancy case, ASP1 in Host3 would be sent any incoming
message with SSN=x.  ASP1 in Host4 would normally be brought to the "active"
state upon failure of, or loss of connectivity to, ASP1/Host1.
.pp
The AS List at SGP1 in Host1 might also be set up in load-share mode:
.ix +4
.TS
tab(:);
lsss
ll1c1l.
Routing Key {SSN=x) - "Application Server #1"
:ASP1/Host3:-:State = Active
:ASP1/Host4:-:State = Active
.TE
.pp
In this case, both the ASPs would be sent a portion of the traffic.  For
example the two ASPs could together form a database, where incoming queries
may be sent to any active ASP.
.pp
Care might need to be exercised by a Network Operator in the selection of the
routing information to be used as the Routing Key for a particular AS.
.pp
For example, where Application Servers are defined using ranges of GT Address
values, the Operator is implicitly splitting up control of the related address
groups.  Some GT address value range assignments may interfere with TCAP
subsystem management procedures.
.pp
In the process of fail-over, it is recommended that in the case of ASPs that
transactions do not fail.  For example, the two ASPs may share transaction
state via shared memory, or may use an ASP to ASP protocol to pass transaction
state information.  Any ASP-to-ASP protocol to support this function is
outside the scope of this document.
.sh 3 "Signalling Gateway Redundancy"
.pp
Signalling Gateways may also be distributed over multiple hosts.  Much like
the AS model, SGs may comprise one or more SG Processes (SGPs), distributed
over one or more hosts, using an override, load-share or broadcast model.
Should an SGP lose all or partial SS7 connectivity and other SGPs exist, the
SGP may terminate the SCTP associations to the concerned ASPs or send an
unsolicited ASPIA ACK for the concerned Application Servers.
.pp
It is possible for an ASP to route signalling messages destined to the SS7
network using more than one SGP.  In this model, a Signalling Gateway is
deployed as a cluster of hosts acting as a single SG.  An override redundancy
model is possible, where the unavailability of the SCTP association to a
primary SGP could be used to reroute affected traffic to an alternate
SGP.  A load-sharing model is possible, where the signalling messages are
load-shared between multiple SGPs.  A broadcast model is also possible, where
signalling messages are sent to each active SGP in the SG. The distribution of
the TC-user messages over the SGPs should be done in such a way to minimize
message mis-sequencing, as required by the SS7 User Parts.
.pp
It may also be possible for an ASP to use more than one SG to access a
specific SS7 end point, in a model that resembles an SS7 STP mated pair.
Typically, SS7 STPs are deployed in mated pairs, with traffic load-shared
between them.  Other models are also possible, subject to the limitations of
the local SS7 network provisioning guidelines.
.pp
From the perspective of the TUA layer at an ASP, a particular SG is capable of
transferring traffic to a provisioned SS7 destination, subsystem or
application X if an SCTP association with at least one SGP of the SG is
established, the SGP has returned an acknowledgment to the ASP to indicate
that the ASP is actively handling traffic for that destination, subsystem or
application X, and the SGP has not indicated that the destination, subsystem or
application X is inaccessible.  When an ASP is configured to use multiple SGPs
for transferring traffic to the SS7 network, the ASP must maintain knowledge
of the current capability of the SGPs to handle traffic to destinations,
subsystems and applications of interest.  This information is crucial to
the overall reliability of the service, for override, load-sharing and
broadcast models, in the event of failures, recovery and maintenance
activities.  The ASP TUA may also use this information for congestion
avoidance purposes.  The distribution of the TC-user messages over the SGPs
should be done in such a way to minimize message mis-sequencing, as required by
the some TCAP applications.
