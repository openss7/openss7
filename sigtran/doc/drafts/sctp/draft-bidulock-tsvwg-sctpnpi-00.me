This Internet Draft provides a specification mapping the Stream Control
Transmission Protocol RFC 2960
.[
RFC 2960
.]
into a SVR 4.2 STREAMS provider interface.
The benefit of this specification includes compatibility to UNIX International
TLI (Transport Layer Interface),
.[
TPI
.]
TPI (Transport Provider Interface),
.[
TPI
.]
and XOpen/XPG4 XTI (XOpen Transport
Interface)
.[

.]
for maximum compatibility with OSI and IP transport provider
applications based on SVR 4.2 STREAMS.  In addition, this specification
provides access to the features of SCTP which extend beyond those of existing
transport level interfaces.

.sh 1 "Introduction"
.lp
In contrast with the RFC 2126 (ITOT)
.[
RFC 2126
.]
which uses TCP to provide ISO Network Service in support of ISO Transport
Service, this specification takes the approach of using the Open Group ISO
Transport Provider Interface
.[
TPI
.]
as an interface to the RFC 2960 Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP).
.[
RFC 2960
.]
This permits applications which are written to the XPG4/XTI
.[
xti
.]
library which interfaces to the TPI
.[
TPI
.]
and socket compatibility libraries to be used without much modification for
use with a SCTP Transport Provider which conforms to the SCTP-TPI.
.lp
This document provides an SCTP-specific implementation of the Transport
Provider Interface and provides details concerning address formats, options
and option formats, and specific IOCTLs and error handling around the
framework provided for in the TPI.
.[
TPI
.]
.lp
This document describes the specification of an SCTP Transport Provider which
uses the Open Group STREAMS Transport Provider Interface as an interface to
Stream Control Transmission Protocol features and functions.  Because of the
need to select the SCTP stream upon which data is transmitted or received, it
is necessary to use Version 2, Draft 2 of the Transport Provider Interface
.[
TPI
.]
as a basis for the specification, as this version incudes the
\fBT_OPTDATA_REQ\fR and \fBT_OPTDATA_IND\fR primitives which are necessary for
the selection of SCTP stream identifier, payload protocol identifier, and
other SCTP-specific options.  It is possible to use a subset of this
specification which is compatible with the TLI
.[
TLI
.]
or older versions of the TPI,
.[
TPI
.]
however, selection of SCTP stream for transmission becomes awkward and
distinguishing streams upon reception may be impossible.
.lp
The TPI specification
.[
TPI
.]
leaves a number of implementation- and provider-specific details to be
described by a particular implementation or provider.  This document details
the SCTP provider-specific details which are necessary for access to SCTP
features and functions.  In addition, it proposes some common
implementation-specific managment features and functions necessary to support
the global SCTP options as well as provide access to the SCTP-MIB.

.lp
The format of the SCTP address is as follows:
.(l
.nf
\fCstruct sctp_addr {
	uint16_t    port;
	uint32_t    addr[0];
};
.fi
.)l
.ba +4
.lp
Where
.ip "\fIport\fR"
is the 16-bit local or peer SCTP port number.
.ip "\fIaddr[]\fR"
is a list of 0 or more 32-bit IPv4 network addresses.
.ba -4
.lp
The SCTP Transport Address is interpreted by the SCTP Transport Provider in
the designated primitives and according to the rules described as follows:
.ip "\fIT_INFO_ACK\fR"
This primitive indicates the maximum size of a protocol address in the
\fIADDR_size\fR field of the primitive.  SCTP providers should set this field
to accomodate a number of network addresses in the \fIaddr\fR list in support
of multihomed hosts.  SCTP providers which do not support multihoming should
set this size to 6 for IPv4 providers.
.ip "\fIT_ADDR_ACK\fR"
This primitive indicates the locally bound protocol address and the remote
connected protocol address in the \fILOCADDR_length\fR, \fILOCADDR_offset\fR,
\fIREMADDR_length\fR, and \fIREMADDR_offset\fR, respectively.
The following rules define the SCTP provider-specific interpretation of the
transport address:
.ba +3
.lp
.np
The \fILOCADDR\fR is the locally bound \fIport\fR and \fIaddr\fR list and is
the same as is indicated in the \fBT_BIND_ACK\fR primitive.
For rules concerning the SCTP provider-specific interpretation of this
address, see the rules for the \fBT_BIND_ACK\fR primitive below.
.np
The \fIREMADDR\fR
is the remote connected protocol address and is the same as is returned in the
\fBT_CONN_IND\fR or the \fBT_CONN_CON\fR primitive.
For rules concerning the SCTP provider-specific interpretation of these
addresses, see the rules for \fBT_CONN_IND\fR and \fBT_CONN_CON\fR below.
.ba -3
.ip "\fIT_BIND_REQ\fR"
This primitive provides the protocol address to which the user is requesting
that the STREAM be bound in the \fIADDR_length\fR and \fIADDR_offset\fR
fields.
The following rules define the SCTP provider-specific interpretation of the
transport address:
.ip "\fIT_BIND_ACK\fR"
This primitive indicates the protocol address to which the STREAM has been bound
by the provider in the \fIADDR_length\fR and \fIADDR_offset\fR fields.
The following rules define the SCTP provider-specific interpretation of the
transport address:
.ba +3
.lp
.np
The \fBT_BIND_ACK\fR primitive always returns a non-zero \fIADDR_length\fR in
the primitive.
.np
If the \fIport\fR field of the address is zero, then the
STREAM is bound as a "default listener" on the returned network addresses.
.np
If the \fIport\fR number is non-zero then the port number specified is that to
which the stream was bound.
.np
If the \fIaddr\fR list is empty, then the STREAM is bound to any and all network
addresses which are available to the SCTP provider.
.np
If the \fIaddr\fR list is not emply, then the STREAM is bound to only those
network addresses which are present in the list.
.ba -3
.ip
The bound protocol address has provider-specific meaning to the SCTP Transport
Provider.  When the STREAM is bound as a "listener" (i.e. \fICONIND_number\fR
is non-zero), it will accept incoming \fBINIT\fR messages sent to the
specified port number on any of the listed network addresses (or if there is
no list, any network address).  When the STREAM response to an SCTP \fBINIT\fR
chunk with an SCTP \fBINIT-ACK\fR chunk, the list of bound network addresses
will be placed in the address list in the SCTP \fBINIT-ACK\fR chunk.

When the STREAM is bound with \fICONIND_number\fR set to zero, a subsequent
\fBT_CONN_REQ\fR primitive will launch an SCTP \fBINIT\fR chunk with the list of
bound network addresses in the address list in the SCTP \fBINIT\fR chunk.

.ip "\fIT_CONN_REQ\fR"
This primitive provides the destination protocol address to which the user is
requesting that the STREAM be connected in the \fIDEST_length\fR and
\fIDEST_offset\fR fields.
The following rules define the SCTP provider-specific interpretation of the
transport address:
.ba +3
.lp
.np
The \fBT_CONN_REQ\fR primitive must always be issued by the user with a
non-zero \fIADDR_length\fR field, and the protocol address must contain at
least one network address in the address list.
.np
If the \fIport\fR field in the transport address is zero, the SCTP provider
will attempt to select a port.
.np
If the protocol address \fIaddr\fR list has more than one network address in
the list, only the first network address will be used as the destination of
the SCTP \fBINIT\fR chunk which wil be issued to attempt the connection.
.np
Additional destination network addresses in the \fIaddr\fR list may be used as
eligible destination network addresses once the association is formed later
and in conjunction with the network addresses which are returned by the peer
in the SCTP \fBINIT-ACK\fR chunk.
.ba -3
.ip "\fIT_CONN_CON\fR"
This primitive indicates the protocol address of the peer endpoint
which is connected to the STREAM in the \fIRES_length\fR and \fIRES_offset\fR
fields.
The following rules define the SCTP provider-specific interpretation of the
transport address:
.ba +3
.lp
.np
The \fBT_CONN_CON\fR primitive is always issued by the provider with a
non-zero \fIRES_length\fR field, and the protocol address will contain at
least one network address in the address list.
.np
The first network address in the \fIaddr\fR list is the network address of the
peer endpoint which responded with an SCTP \fBINIT-ACK\fR chunk and a
subsequent \fBCOOKIE-ACK\fR chunk confirming the connection.
.np
The remaining network addresses (if any) are addresses which were provided in
the SCTP \fBINIT-ACK\fR chunk.  These are the alternative network addresses to
which the local host may send SCTP packets belonging to the association.
.ba -3
.ip "\fIT_CONN_IND\fR"
This primitive indicates the protocol address of the peer endpoint
which is attempting to connect to the STREAM in the \fISRC_length\fR and
\fISRC_offset\fR fields.
The following rules define the SCTP provider-specific interpretation of the
transport address:
.ba +3
.lp
.np
The \fBT_CONN_IND\fR primitive is always issued by the provider with a
non-zero \fISRC_length\fR field, and the protocol address will contain at
least one network address in the address list.
.np
The first network address in the \fIaddr\fR list is the network address of the
peer endpoint which initiated an SCTP \fBINIT\fR chunk and responded with an
SCTP \fBCOOKIE-ECHO\fR chunk.
.np
The remaining network addresses (if any) are addresses which were provided in
the SCTP \fBINIT\fR chunk and echoed in the cookie in the \fBCOOKIE-ECHO\fR
chunk.  These are the alternative network addresses to which the local host
may send SCTP packets belonging to the association.
.ba -3

The general format of the Transport Option is as follows:
.(l
.nf
\fCstruct t_opthdr {
        t_uscalar_t len;    /* Option length, incl. header  */
        t_uscalar_t level;  /* Option level                 */

        t_uscalar_t status; /* Negotiation result           */
        /* followed by option data */
};
.fi
.)l

.ip "\fIT_SCTP_NODELAY\fR"
This option is formatted as a single \fIt_uscalar_t\fR boolean flag.

Turns the Nagle algorithm off.  This means that packets are always sent as
soon as possible and no unnecessary delays are introduced, at the cost of more
packets in the network.  Expects a \fIt_uscalar_t\fR boolean flag.

This parallels the \fITCP_NODELAY\fR option for compatibility with \fBTCP\fR.
\fIT_SCTP_NODELAY\fR and \fITCP_NODELAY\fR can be used interchangeably.
This setting applies to the entire SCTP association.

This option has meaning in \fBT_OPTMGMT_REQ\fR and \fBT_OPTMGMT_ACK\fR
primitives.
.ip "\fIT_SCTP_MAXSEG\fR"
This option is formatted as a single \fIt_uscalar_t\fR which contains the
maximum segment size in bytes.

This option has meaning in \fBT_OPTMGMT_REQ\fR and \fBT_OPTMGMT_ACK\fR
primitives.
.ip "\fIT_SCTP_RECVSID\fR"
This option is formatted as a single \fIt_uscalar_t\fR boolean flag.

This option has meaning in \fBT_OPTMGMT_REQ\fR and \fBT_OPTMGMT_ACK\fR
primitives.
.ip "\fIT_SCTP_RECVPPI\fR"
This option is formatted as a single \fIt_uscalar_t\fR boolean flag.

This option has meaning in \fBT_OPTMGMT_REQ\fR and \fBT_OPTMGMT_ACK\fR
primitives.
.ip "\fIT_SCTP_RECVSSN\fR"
This option is formatted as a single \fIt_uscalar_t\fR boolean flag.

This option has meaning in \fBT_OPTMGMT_REQ\fR and \fBT_OPTMGMT_ACK\fR
primitives.
.ip "\fIT_SCTP_HB\fR"

This option has meaning in \fBT_OPTMGMT_REQ\fR and \fBT_OPTMGMT_ACK\fR
primitives.
.ip "\fIT_SCTP_RTO\fR"

This option has meaning in \fBT_OPTMGMT_REQ\fR and \fBT_OPTMGMT_ACK\fR
primitives.
.ip "\fIT_SCTP_SID\fR"
This option is formatted as a single \fIt_uscalar_t\fR which contains the
stream id significant to 16-bits.

This option has meaning in \fBT_OPTDATA_REQ\fR, \fBT_OPTDATA_IND\fR,
\fBT_OPTMGMT_REQ\fR, and \fBT_OPTMGMT_ACK\fR primitives.
.ip "\fIT_SCTP_PPI\fR"
This option is formatted as a single \fIt_uscalar_t\fR which contains the
Payload Protocol Identifier significant to 32-bits.

This option has meaning in \fBT_OPTDATA_REQ\fR, \fBT_OPTDATA_IND\fR,
\fBT_OPTMGMT_REQ\fR, and \fBT_OPTMGMT_ACK\fR primitives.
.ip "\fIT_SCTP_SSN\fR"
This option is formatted as a single \fIt_uscalar_t\fR which contains the
stream sequence number significant to 16-bits.

This option has meaning in \fBT_OPTDATA_REQ\fR, \fBT_OPTDATA_IND\fR,
\fBT_OPTMGMT_REQ\fR, and \fBT_OPTMGMT_ACK\fR primitives.
.ip "\fIT_SCTP_CORK\fR"
This option is formatted as a single \fIt_uscalar_t\fR boolean flag.

If enabled, the provider will not send out partial TSDUs.  All queued
partial TSDUs are sent when the option is cleared again.  This is useful for
prepending headers or for throughput optimization.  This option cannot be
combined with \fBT_SCTP_NODELAY\fR.

This parallels \fITCP_CORK\fR for compatibility with \fBTCP\fR.
\fIT_SCTP_CORK\fR and \fITCP_CORK\fR can be used interchangeably.  For
\fBT_OPTDATA_REQ\fR, this setting applies to the default or specified SCTP
stream as set by the \fIT_SCTP_SID\fR option.

This option has meaning in \fBT_OPTDATA_REQ\fR primitives.
.ip "\fIT_SCTP_STREAMS\fR"
This option is formated as follows:
.(l
.nf
\fCstruct sctp_opt_streams {
        uint16_t    i_streams;
        uint16_t    o_streams;

.ip "\fIi_streams\fR"
indicates the maximum or actual number of inbound SCPT streams.
.ip "\fIo_streams\fR"
indicates the requested or actual number of outbound SCTP streams.
.ba -4
.ip
This option has meaning in \fBT_CONN_REQ\fR, \fBT_CONN_CON\fR,
\fBT_CONN_IND\fR, \fBT_OPTMGMT_REQ\fR, and \fBT_OPTMGMT_ACK\fR primitives.

.sh 2 "SCTP Errors"

The TPI specifies that the Transport Provider reply to a \fBT_INFO_REQ\fR
primitive with a \fBT_INFO_ACK\fR primitive.  Although there are a number of
alternatives in the responding \fBT_INFO_ACK\fR primitive, the SCTP Transport
Provider will respond with a smaller set of responses as defined here.  The
\fBT_INFO_ACK\fR primitive will have values populated as follows:
.ba +4
.ip "\fIPRIM_type\fR"
This indicates the primitive type and is always set to \fBT_INFO_ACK\fR.
.ip "\fITSDU_size\fR"
The size of the TSDU (Transport Service Data Unit) should be set to -1 to
indicate that the provider supports the concept of a TSDU and that there is no
limit on the maximum size of a TSDU.
.ip "\fIETSDU_size\fR"
The size of the ETSDU (Expedited Transport Service Data Unit) should be set to
-1 to indicate that the provider support the concept of a ETSDU and that there
is no limit on the maximum size of a ETSDU.
.ip "\fICDATA_size\fR"
The size of CDATA (Connection Data) should be set to -1 to indicate that the
provider supports the transfer of data with connect primitives and that there
is no limit on the maximum amount of data sent with the connect primitives.
.ip "\fIDDATA_size\fR"
The size of DDATA (Disconnect Data) should be set to -1 to indicate that the
provider supports the transfer of data with disconnect primitives and that
there is no limit on the maximum amount of data sent with the disconnect
primitives.  (Note: this only really has practical use with orderly release
primitives \fBT_ORDREL_REQ\fR and \fBT_ORDREL_IND\fR.)
.ip "\fIADDR_size\fR"
If the provider has a restriction on the maximum number of IP addresses which
can be provided in an SCTP endpoint address, this size should be set to
reflect that value.  Otherwise, this value should be set to -1 to indicate
that there is no limit on the number of IP addresses which are provided with
any primitive.
.ip "\fIOPT_size\fR"
If the provider has a restriction on the maximum number of options which can
be provided in an operation, this size should be set to reflect that value.
Otherwise, this value should be set to -1 to indicate that there is no limit
on the number of options which are provided with any primitive.
.ip "\fITIDU_size\fR"
This should be set to the system-tunable system limit on the maximum size of a
STREAMS message.  It might be possible to set this value to the current
maximum size of the data in a DATA chunk which will currently fit within the
path MTU, however, the provider cannot reject TIDUs which are larger than this
dynamic value but which are smaller than the value first advertized when the
STREAM was opened.
.ip "\fISERV_type\fR"
This field should be set to \fBT_COTS_ORD\fR to indicate that the SCTP
provider is connection oriented with orderly release support.
.ip "\fICURRENT_state\fR"
This field should be set to the TPI provider state.
.ip "\fIPROVIDER_flag\fR"
This field should NOT have \fBSENDZERO\fR set (because SCTP does not support
the sending of zero-length TSDUs in general) and should have \fBXPG4_1\fR set
to indicate support for XPG4 semantics (\fBT_ADDR_REQ\fR and
\fBT_ADDR_ACK\fR).
.ba -4

.sh 3 "Binding and Listening"
.lp
Once a STREAM is opened the provider places the STREAM in the \fBTS_UNBND\fR
state and the STREAM is available for binding with the \fBT_BIND_REQ\fR
primitive and will be placed in the \fBTS_BIND\fR state.  A STREAM which is in
the \fBTS_BIND\fR state may be unbound again using the \fBT_UNBIND_REQ\fR
primitive and returned to the \fBTS_UNBND\fR state.  Unlike BSD sockets, this
permits a STREAM to be reused for another connection without closing and
reopening another STREAM.
.sh 4 "T_BIND_REQ, T_BIND_ACK"
.lp
STREAMS must be bound to a local protocol address before they can become
involved in a connection and used for data transfer.  The semantics for
binding and unbinding STREAMS are identical to those provided in the Transport
Provider Interface.  The only specifics of the SCTP implementation lie in the
format and interpretation of the transport address.  The \fBT_BIND_REQ\fR
primtive provides an opaque protocol address as indicated by \fIADDR_length\fR
and \fIADDR_offset\fR which in the SCTP implementation has the following
format:
.(l
\fCtypedef struct sctp_addr {
	uint16_t    port;
	uint32_t    addr[0];
} sctp_addr_t;
.)l
Where
.ba +4
.ip "\fIport\fR"
indicates the 16-bit (host order) port number to which to bind; and,
.ip "\fIaddr\fR"
indicates an array of 32-bit IPv4 addresses (host order) to which to bind.
.ba -4
.lp
The transport address will be interpreted according to the following rules by
the SCTP Transport Provider:
.np
If the transport address is not provided (i.e. \fIADDR_length\fR is zero), the
SCTP provider will assign an available port number from the range of port
numbers available to SCTP and will bind the STREAM to any and all IPv4
addresses which are available to the SCTP Transport Provider.
.np
If the transport address is provided, but does not contain any IPv4 addresses,
the SCTP Transport Provider will bind the STREAM to any and all IPv4 addresses
which are available to the SCTP Transport Provider.
.np
If the transport address is provided with the \fIport\fR set to zero, and the
\fICONIND_number\fR is also set to zero, the SCTP TP will assign a port
number.
.np
If the transport address is provided with the \fIport\fR set to zero, and the
\fICONIND_number\fR is non-zero, the SCTP TP will treat the STREAM as a
"default listener."  This \fIdefault listener\fR will receive indications for
any port number on the bound IPv4 addresses which are not otherwise bound.

One and only one STREAM may be bound as a \fIdefault listener\fR to any given
IPv4 address.  If the STREAM is bound as a \fIdefault listener\fR and no IPv4
addresses are provided in the transport address, the STREAM will receive all
SCTP messages to which no other STREAM is bound.
.np
All valid IPv4 addresses may be bound to a SCTP Transport Provider STREAM.
This includes \fIbroadcast\fR and \fImulticast\fR addresses; however, to bind
to a \fIbroadcast\fR or \fImulticast\fR address may require that the STREAM
was opened with sufficient access permissions to allow binding of these
addresses.  \fIBroadcast\fR and \fImulticast\fR addresses will only be used by
the SCTP Transport Provider for establishment of an SCTP association (INIT
chunks) and will not be used for normal transmission or retransmission of
chunks.
.lp
Other than the above rules, the TPI semantics of the \fBT_BIND_REQ\fR and
\fBT_BIND_ACK\fR primitives are preserved, particularly with regards to the
treatment of the \fICONIND_number\fR field.

Considering the SCTP Transport Provider interpretation of the transport
address, the following errors may be returned in a \fBT_ERROR_ACK\fR primitive
in response to a problematic \fBT_BIND_REQ\fR primitive:
.ba +4
.ip "\fBTACCES\fR"
This indicates that the user did not have proper permissions for the use of
the requested address.  This includes the following reasons:
.ba +4
.np
The user attempted to bind to a port number within the UNIX protected port
number range (1-1024) and did not have sufficient priviledge.
.np
The user attempted to bind to a \fIbroadcast\fR or \fImulticast\fR address and
did not have sufficient priviledge.
.np
The user attempted to bind a \fIdefault listener\fR (i.e. to bind to port 0)
and did not have sufficient priviledge.
.ba -4
.ip "\fBTADDRBUSY\fR"
This indicates that the requested address was in use.  This includes the
following reasons:
.ba +4
.lp
.np
The SCTP TP only permits one STREAM to be a "listener" (i.e. with a non-zero
\fICONIND_number\fR) for a given port number IPv4 address combination.

The
\fBT_BIND_REQ\fR will be rejected it the user attempts to bind a second STREAM
with a non-zero \fICONIND_number\fR to the same port number and IPv4 address
combination to which another STREAM is already bound with a non-zero
\fICONIND_number\fR.
.np
The SCTP TP only permits one STREAM to be a "default listener" (i.e. listening
on all ports) for a given IPv4 address.

The \fBT_BIND_REQ\fR will be rejected if the user attempts to bind a second
"default listener" with a zero \fIport\fR number and a non-zero
\fICONIND_number\fR to the same IPv4 address to which another STREAM is
already bound with a zero \fIport\fR number and a non-zero
\fICONIND_number\fR.
.ba -4
.ip "\fBTBADADDR\fR"
This indicates that the protocol address was in an incorrect format or the
address contained invalid information.  It is not intended to indicate
protocol errors.  This may include the following reasons:
.ba +4
.lp
.np
The size of the address as given by \fIADDR_length\fR is not the size of the
\fBsctp_addr\fR structure plus a positive integer number of 4-byte IPv4
addresses.
.np
The format of the \fBsctp_addr\fR structure is correct, but one or more of the
IPv4 addresses provided are not valid IPv4 addresses (e.g. 0.1.1.1 or 0.0.0.0).

(Note: the SCTP TP does not permit binding to address 0.0.0.0)
.ba -4
.ip "\fBTNOADDR\fR"
This indicates that the transport provider could not allocate an address.
This may include the following reasons:
.ba +4
.lp
.np
The user has requested that the SCTP Transport Provider provide a transport
address with \fICONIND_number\fR equal to zero, and the SCTP TP is unable to
assign a port number because all the port numbers within the assignable range
are in use.
.ba -4
.ip "\fBTOUTSTATE\fR"
The primitive would place the transport interface out of state.
.ip "\fBTSYSERR\fR"
A system error occurred and the UNIX system error is indicated in the
primitive.  This may include the following errors:
.ba +4
.ip "\fBENOMEM\fR"
There was insufficient memory resources to complete the operation.
.ip "\fBEFAULT\fR"
A recoverable internal software error has occured.
.ba -4
.ba -4

.sh 4 "T_UNBIND_REQ"
.lp
STREAMS which are in the \fBTS_IDLE\fR state (i.e. those which are not
currently involved in an SCTP association) can be unbound at any time using
the \fBT_UNBIND_REQ\fR primitive.  As provided for the TPI specification, this
primitive permits the unbinding, or reversal of the bind operation.
.lp
There are no SCTP Transport Provider specifics concerning this primitive.

.sh 1 "Use of XTI with SCTP protocol"
.sh 2 "Introduction"
.lp
This section describes the protocol-specific information that is relevant for
SCTP transport providers.  It also defines data structures and constants
required for SCTP transport providers which are exposed through the
<xti_sctp.h> header file.
.sh 2 "Protocol Features"
.ip "\fIT_MORE Flag and TSDUs\fR"
The notion of TSDU is supported by SCTP transport provider, so the T_MORE flag
is interpreted correctly by the SCTP transport provider.
.ip "\fIExpedited Data\fR"
SCTP does not have a notion of expedited data in a sense comparable to ISO
expedited data.  SCTP defines an out-of-order delivery mechanism which can
be implemented similar to TCP's urgent mechanism, by which DATA chunks which
are marked for out-of-order delivery could be transmitted in advance of normal
in-order deliver DATA chunks on a given stream.  See the SCTP Draft Standard
for more detailed information.
.ip "\fIOrderly Release\fR"
The orderly release functions \fBt_sndrel()\fR and \fBt_rcvrel()\fR which were
defined to support the orderly release facility of TCP will also be used for
the orderly release facility of SCTP.  The specification states that only
established connections may be closed with orderly release: that is, on an
endpoint in T_DATAXFER or T_INREL state.
.ip "\fIAbortive Release\fR"
Functions \fBt_sdnddis()\fR and \fBt_rcvdis()\fR may be used to perform
abortive release over SCTP transport.  However, their use is not recommended
as the abortive release primitive (ABORT chunk) is not transmitted reliably by
the SCTP protocol.
.ip "\fIConnection Establishment\fR"
Unlike TCP, SCTP partially allows the possibility of refusing a connection
indication.  This is peformed by sending an ABORT chunk instead of a
COOKIE-ACK chunk in response to a COOKIE-ECHO.  Therfore, unlike TCP,
\fBt_listen()\fR and \fBt_accept()\fR have similar semantics to that for ISO
providers.
.ip "\fIConnection Release\fR"
After a connection has been released, the local address(es) bound to the
endpoint may be qualified with the local IP address (rather than having a
wildcard IP address).  Also, the port number itself may have been changed
during the \fBt_accept()\fR processing.  If the endpoint is not being reused
immediately then it is recommended that it should be unbound or closed so that
other users can successfully bind to the address.

.sh 2 "Options"
.lp
Options are formatted according to the structure \fBt_opthdr\fR as described
in \fIThe Use of Options in XTI\fR.
.[
xti
.]
A transport provider compliant to this specification supports none, all or any
subset of the options defined in \fISCTP-Level Options\fR and
\fIIP-Level Options\fR.
.[
xti
.]
An implementation may restrict the use of any of these options by offering
them only in privileged or read-only mode.

.sh 3 "SCTP-Level Options"

The protocol level is \fBT_INET_SCTP\fR.  For this level,
\fISCTP-Level Options\fR shows the options that are defined.

These options do \fBnot\fR have end-to-end significance.  The may be
negotiated in all XTI states except \fBT_UNBIND\fR and \fRT_UNINIT\fR.  They
are read-only in state \fBT_UNBND\fR.  See \fIThe Use of Options in XTI\fR
.[
xti
.]
for the differences between options that have end-to-end significance and
those that do not.
.sh 3 "Absolute Requirements"
.lp
A request for T_SCTP_NODELAY and a request to activate T_SCTP_KEEPALIVE is an
absolute requirement.  T_SCTP_MAXSEG is a read-only option.
.sh 3 "Further Remarks"
.ip "\fIT_SCTP_KEEPALIVE\fR"
If this option is set, the heartbeat mechanism of SCTP is activated on all
destination addresses to monitor idle destination addresses which may no
longer be reachable.  If a destination has been idle for the last heartbeat
timeout interval, a HEARTBEAT chunk is sent to check if the destination is
still alive or broken.

HEARTBEAT chunks are an explicit feature of SCTP, and this practice is part of
the SCTP Standard.  The option value consists of a structure \fBt_sctp_hb\fR
declared as:
.(l
.nf
\fCtypedef struct sctp_hb
    struct sctp_addr hb_dest;  /* destination address      */
    t_scalar_t       hb_onoff; /* activation flag          */
    t_scalar_t       hb_itvl;  /* interval in milliseconds */
} t_sctp_hb_t;
.fi
.)l
.ip
Legal values for the field \fIhb_dest\fR is a valid IP address which indicates
the destination addresses of the SCTP association for which the heartbeat
parameters are to be set.
.ip
Legal values for the field \fIhb_onoff\fR are:
.ba +8
.ip "\fBT_NO\fR" 8
switch the heartbeat for destination \fIhb_dest\fR off
.ip "\fBT_YES\fR" 8
activate the heartbeat for destination \fIhb_dest\fR
.ba -8
.ip
The field \fIhb_itvl\fR determines the frequency of HEARTBEAT chunks being
sent, in milliseconds.  The transport user can request the default value by
setting the field to \fBT_UNSPEC\fR.  The default is implementation-dependent,
but at least 60 seconds (see the referenced RFC 2960).  Legal values for this
field are \fBT_UNSPEC\fR and all positive numbers.

The timeout value is not an absolute requirement.  The implementation may pose
upper and lower limits to this value.  Requests that fall short of the lower
limit may be negotiated to the lower limit.

The use of this option might be restricted to priviledged users.
.ip "\fIT_SCTP_MAXSEG\fR"
This option is read-only.  It is used to retrieve the maximum SCTP segment
size.
.ip "\fIT_SCTP_NODELAY\fR"
Under some circumstances, SCTP sends data as soon as iti is presented.  When
outstanding data has not yet been acknowledged, it gathers small amounts of
output to be sent in a single packet once an acknowledgement is received.  For
a small number of clients, such as window systems (for example, MIT X Window
System) that send a stream of mouse events which receive no replies, this
packetization may cause significant delays.  T_SCTP_NODELAY is used to defeat
this algorithm.  Legal option values are \fBT_YES\fR ("don't delay") and
\fBT_NO\fR ("delay").
.ip "\fIT_SCTP_RTO\fR"

.sh 2 "Functions"
.ip "\fBt_accept\fR()"
Issuing a \fBt_accept\fR() assigns an already established connection to
\fIresfd\fR.  Since user data may be exchanged during the connection
establishment phase, \fIcall->udata.len\fR can be larger than 0.

When (\fIresfd != fd\fR), the function \fBt_accept\fR() is recommended to be
called with \fIresfd\fR in \fBT_UNBND\fR state, though an endpoint which is
bound to any local address (in \fBT_IDLE\fR) state) can also be used.

After \fBt_accept\fR() completes, the endpoint \fIresfd\fR will represent a
connected SCTP endpoint whose complete binding essentially has both local and
remote address components.

If file descriptor \fIresfd\fR was unbound before calling \fBt_accept\fR(),
after the call completes its local address binding would be to the same
protocol address bound to \fIfd\fR.  If file descriptor \fIresfd\fR was bound
to a local address before calling \fBt_accept\fR(), that local address binding
is dissolved and the local address part of the binding after \fBt_accept\fR()
completes would become the same as the address bound to \fIfd\fR.

If options with end-to-end significance (T_IP_OPTIONS, T_IP_TOS) are to be
sent with the connection confirmation, the values of these options must be set
with \fBt_optmgmt\fR() before the T_LISTEN event occurs.  When the transport
user detects a T_LISTEN, SCTP has already established the connection.
Association-related options passed with \fBt_accept\fR() become effective at
once, but since the connection is already established, they are transmitted
with subsequent IP datagrams sent out in the T_DATAXFER state.
.ip "\fBt_bind\fR()"
The \fIaddr\fR field of the \fBt_bind\fR structure represents the local
socket; that is, an address which specifically includes a port identifier.

Some implementations treat port number 0 as a request to bind to any unused
port.  Other than that value, a port number part of the binding is specific.
The IP address part of the binding can represent a single IP address or a list
of IP addresses or a wildcard binding to an address that could represent
multiple IP addresses that are legal for the host.
.ip "\fBt_close\fR()"
The \fBt_close\fR() call will result in a \fBclose\fR call on the descriptor
of this XTI communication endpoint.  If there are no other descriptors in this
process or any other process which reference this communication endpoint, the
\fBclose\fR() call will perform an orderly connection termination according to
the rules of a SCTP SHUTDOWN call on this connection endpoint as specified in
standard RFC 2960.
.[
RFC 2960
.]
If the XTI_LINGER options is supported and is used to enable the \fIlinger\fR
option, the linger time will affect the time an implementation lingers in the
execution of \fBt_close\fR() or \fBclose\fR().  A linger time of 0 specified
with the XTI_LINGER option may cause an abortive release of a SCTP connection,
resulting in lost data.
.ip "\fBt_connect\fR()"
The \fIsndcall->addr\fR struct specifies the remote socket.  In the present
version, the returned address set in \fIrcvcall->addr\fR will have the same
value.  Since user data can be exchanged during the connection establishment
phase, \fIsndcall->udata.len\fR can be set to non-zero.

Note that the likely the peer SCTP, and not the peer transport user, will
confirm the connection.
.ip "\fBt_listen\fR()"
Upon successful return, \fBt_lister\fR() indicates an connection indication
and not an existing connection.  Since user data may be exchanged during the
connection establishment phase, \fIsndcall->udata.len\fR may be non-zero
before the call to \fBlisten\fR().  The \fIcall->addr\fR structure contains
the remote calling socket.
.ip "\fBt_open\fR()"
\fBt_open\fR() is called as the first step in the initialization of a
transport endpoint.  This function returns various default characteristics of
the underlying transport protocol by setting fields in the \fIt_info\fR
structure.  The following should be the values returned by the call to
\fBt_open\fR() and \fBt_getinfo\fR() with the indicated transport provider.

.ip "\fBt_snddis\fR()"
Sincde data may not be sent with a disconnect, \fIcall->udata.len\fR must be
set to zero.
