-- Default values:

-- provide values where no protocol profile is specified.  These are 
-- default-default values in the sense that the act as default values 
-- for management operations, however, once set by a management station 
-- or by internal system operations, they persist across both agent and 
-- system reboots.

    DESCRIPTION 
        "This scalar defines, for M2PA, by default whether the 
         Nagle algorithm should be applied to SCTP associations.  
         The Nagle algorithm increases the size of the packets 
         placed on the network at the expense of delaying the 
         transmission of some data during congestion episodes.  
         When set to true(1), the Nagle algorithm is suppressed; 
         otherwise, set to false(2), the Nagle algorithm is in 
         effect.
         
         The default default is true(1): send packets without 
         delay.  The default default value is only application 
         when never set by any management station.  When set, 
         the scalar value must persist across system reboots."

         payload size for outgoing packets.  Values greater than 
         the association MTU are ignored and have no effect.  
         The value determines the maximum size (in octets) above 
         which SCCP will fragment larger DATA chunis into 
         smaller DATA chunks, and beneath which SCTP will bundle 
         DATA chunks into a single packate or combine smaller 
         DATA chunks into larger DATA chunks.  Normally this 
         value is the association MTU value must the size of the 
         current IP and SCTP headers, minus the size of one DATA 
         chunk header.  When set to a lower value, the lower 
         value will be used.
         
         The default default allows the prevailing MTU to be 
         controlling (65536 octets).  The default default value 
         is only application when never set by any management

    MAX-ACCESS  read-write
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
        "This scalar defines, for M2PA, the default time 
         interval (in milliseconds) between successive HEARTBEAT 
         messages used to probe destination transport addresses 
         for RTT calculation and activity.  Valid values are 
         zero (0) - do not heartbeat, or a value of 1 
         millisecond or greater.
         
         In general this value determines the amount of time 
         that it takes for an SCTP association to detect a 
         failure on a association which has no data to transmit 
         or retransmit.  M2PA, however, is used by MTP Level 3 
         which generates a test message every T2, where T2 is 
         defined in ITU-T Rec. Q.707 (1993) or ANSI T1.111.7 
         (2000) to have a range from 4 to 12 seconds.  
         Therefore, for M2PA, unless the SCTP heartbeat interval 
         is set below Q.707-T2, it will only have effect on 
         multihomed associations for checking the status of 
         non-primary or non-CMT destinations.
         
         Reducing this value will reduce the amount of time 
         taken to detect primary and non-primary, non-CMT path, 
         interface and destination failures, but may only affect 
         primary destinations if reduced below the coresponding 
         Q.707-T2 value.
         
         The default default value is that recommended by RFC 
         4960 (6000 centiseconds, or 60 seconds).  The default 
         default value is only application when never set by any 
         management station.  When set, the scalar value must 
         persist across system reboots."

         Disabling the heart beat mechanism reduces the 
         protocol's repsonsiveness in detection of failures and 
         redirection of traffic away from failed paths and 
         interfaces, particularly, for M2PA, failed non-primary 
         and non-CMT destinations in an multi-homed association.  
         This scalar should normally be left at its default 
         value.
         
         The default default value from RFC 4960 is true(1).

         value should be greater than the corresponding

         Adjusting this value has an effect on th period of time

         Values of zero will  be converted to a system clock

         Reducing this value will increase the probability that

         This value should be larger than sum of the default

         Setting this value to less than the sum of the default 
         path maximum retransmission values for all of the 
         destinations has the interesting effect of permitting a 
         connection to persist even when all destinations have 
         been deemed inactive.
         
         The default default value is the value recommended in
