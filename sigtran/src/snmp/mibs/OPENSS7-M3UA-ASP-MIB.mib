	DESCRIPTION
		"MIB Module for SIGTRAN M3UA ASP management.

		 General containment rules:

		 -  Each ASP has a number of SG to which it connects.
		 -  Each SG consists of one or more SGP
		 -  Each ASP communicating with an SG forms an 
		    association to each SGP in the SG.

		 -  Each AS can be treated as similar to an MTP-SAP.
		 -  Each ASP can be treated as similar to a signalling 
		    point.
		 -  Each SGP can be treated by an ASP as similar to a 
		    signalling link.
		 -  Each SG can be treated by an ASP as similar to a 
		    (direct) link set
		 -  Each SG grouping can be treated by an ASP as a 
		    combined link set
		 -  Each ASP can have route sets, route lists and routes 
		    which correspond to destinations, combined link sets 
		    (SG groupings), and link sets (SGs)
		
		 Then, management becomes applying the SS7 MTP 
		 management model to these correspondences.  Treat SCTP 
		 associations to SGPs like signalling links, SGs liked 
		 link sets, SG groupings like combined link sets.  When 
		 routing, apply the MTP routing management model.  When 
		 generating alarms and collecting statistics, use the 
		 MTP model.

		 A signalling point X considers that MTP of an

		 when:

		 -  the first link in a direct link set is in the 'in 
		    serivce' state at level 2; or
		 -  another route becomes available due either to 
		    reception of a corresponding TFA, TFR or TRA 
		    message, or by the corresponding link set becoming 
		    available.

		 When the first link in a direct link set toward 
		 signalling point Y, whose MTP is restarting, is in the 
		 'in service' state at level 2, signalling point X 
		 starts a timer T21 and takes into account of any TFP, 
		 TFA and TFR messages received from signalling point Y.  
		 In addition, X takes the following action:

		 -  If X has the transfer function, when the direct link 
		    set is available at level 3, X sends any necessary 
		    TFP and TFR message to Y; then

		 -  X sends a traffic restart allowed message to 
		    signalling point Y.

		 If a signalling point, previously declared to be 
		 inacessible, becomes available again before T21 is 
		 stopped or expires, a corresponding TFA or TFR message 
		 is sent to the signalling point Y whose MTP is 
		 restarting.

		 If a signalling point becomes prohibited or restricted 
		 to signalling point X after a TRA message has been sent 
		 to X by Y, X stops timer T21.

		 When T21 is stopped or expires, signalling point X 
		 sends an MTP-RESUME primitive concerning Y, and all 
		 signalling points made available via Y, to all local 
		 MTP Users.  If X has the transfer function, it 
		 broadcasts to adjacent available signalling points 
		 transfer-allowed and/or tansfer restricted messages 
		 concerning Y and all signalling points made accessible 
		 by Y.

		 After the MTP of an adjacent node X has restarted, and 
		 if T21 has been started, all routes using X are 
		 considered to be available unless corresponding TFP or 
		 TFR messages have been received whilst T21 was running.

		 NOTE: ITU-T T21 is similar to ANSI T28 and T25.

	STATUS		current
	DESCRIPTION
		"9.1. When the first signalling link goes into the in 
		 service state at level 2, the restarting signalling 
		 point begins taking into account any 
		 trasnfer-prohibited, trasnfer-restricted, 
		 transfer-allowed, traffic restart-allowed, and traffic 
		 restart waiting messages received.  The restarting 
		 point starts timer T22 and T26 either when the first 
		 signalling link goes in the in service state at level 2 
		 or when the first signalling link becomes available at 
		 level 3.  When a traffic restart waiting message is 
		 received before user traffic is restarted on the 
		 link(s) to the point that sent the traffic restart 
		 waiting message, timer T25 is started and user traffic 
		 is not restarted on that link set until a traffic 
		 restart allowed message is received or timer T25 
		 expires.

		 9.3. A signalling point X considers that the MTP of an 
		   inaccessible adjacent signalling point Y is 
		   restarting when: (1) The first link in a direct link 
		   set is in the in service state at level 2, or (2) a 
		   route other than a direct link set becomes available, 
		   e.g. through receipt of a transfer allowed or 
		   transfer restart allowed message or the availability 
		   of the corresponding link set.

		 When the first link in a direct link set toward the 
		 restarting signalling point Y goes into the in service 
		 state at level 2, signalling point X begins taking into 
		 account any traffic restart waiting, traffic restart 
		 allowed, transfer-prohibited, transfer-restricted, and 
		 transfer-allowed messages from Y.  Signalling oint X 
		 starts timer T28 either when the first link goes into 
		 the in service state at level 2 or when the first 
		 signalling link becomes available at level 3.  In 
		 addition it takes the following actions:

		 (1) If a TRW message is receive from Y while T28 is 
		 running or before it is started, X starts T25.  X stops 
		 T28 if it is running.
		 (2) If a TRW message is receives from Y while T25 is 
		 running, X restarts T25.
		 (3) When the first link in a link set to Y becomes 
		 available, signalling point X sends to Y a traffic 
		 restart allowed message or, if X has the transfer 
		 function, a traffic restart wiating mesasge followed by 
		 transfer-prohibited (note that all transfer prohibited 
		 messages according to 13.2.2(1) must be sent) and 
		 transfer-restriced messages and a traffic restart 
		 allowed message.
		 (4) If a destination becomes prohibited, restricted, or 
		 available at X, after X has sent a traffic restart 
		 allowed message to Y, X notifies Y of the status change 
		 by the normal procedures in Section 13.
		 (5) When a traffic restart allowed message has been 
		 sent to Y and a traffic restart allowed message has 
		 been received from Y, X stops T25 or T28, whichever is 
		 running, and restarts traffic on the link set to Y.  X 
		 gives MTP-RESUME primitives to users concerning Y and 
		 any destinations made accessible via Y.  If X has the 
		 transfer function it also broadcasts trasnfer-allowed 
		 or transfer-restricted messages concerning the same 
		 destinations.
		 (6) If T28 expires, X restarts traffic on the link set 
		 to Y as in (5), unless a traffic restart allowed 
		 message has not been sent to Y.  In that case, X starts 
		 T25 and completes the sending of transfer prohibited 
		 and transfer restricted messages, followed by a traffic 
		 restart allowed message.  Then, unless a traffic 
		 restart waiting message has been received from Y 
		 without a subsequent traffic restart allowed message, X 
		 stops T25 and restarts traffic on the link set to Y.

		 (7) If T25 expires, X restarts traffic on the link set 
		 toward Y.  In the abnormal case when X has not 
		 completed sending transfer-prohibited and 
		 transfer-restricted messages to Y, X completes sending 
		 transfer-prohibited messges required by 13.2.2 (1) and 
		 sends a traffic restart allowed message before 
		 restarting user traffic.

		 (8) If no traffic restart allowed message has been 
		 received from Y when traffic is restarted to Y, timer 
		 T9 is started.

		 Once an association forms, M3UA sends the ASP Up

		 For M3UA there are no recommended values.  The value of

		 the SG.  If the value is not longer than the lifetime

		 of traffic between routes.  Routes in M3uA consist of 
		 signalling gateways rather than link sets.

	DESCRIPTION
		"Provides the destination audit timer T10 timeout value.  
		 ITU-T and ANSI MTP networks provide a range of T10 
		 values from 30 to 60 seconds.  M3UA networks use a 
		 default value of 60 seconds (6000 centiseconds).

		 This timer is started after receiving DUNA or DRST for 
		 the route (from any SGP in the SG).  It runs and sends 
		 a DAUD message on the route (to any SGP in the SG) 
		 every T10 seconds until stopped.  This timer is stopped 
		 after receiving a DAVA message for the route.

		 A DAUD message is sent from an ASP for a signalling 
		 point after a DUNA message or DRST message is received 
		 from an SGP in the SG.  In this case, a DAUD message is 
		 sent to that SG referring to the destination declared 
		 inaccessible or restricted by the DUNA or DRST message, 
		 every T10 period until a DAVA message, indicating that 
		 the destination has become accessible, is received.

		 The timer T10 is started when a DUNA or DRST message is 
		 received causing the route to change to prohibited or 
		 restricted.  The timer is stopped when a DAVA message 
		 is received causing the route to change to available, 
		 or when the node is restarted.  Upon timer expiry, a 
		 DAUD message is sent to the SG associated with the 
		 route and the timer is restarted.
