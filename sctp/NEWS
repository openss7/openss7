The sections that follow provide information on OpenSS7 releases of the
OpenSS7 Linux Native SCTP package.

 Major changes for release sctp-0.2.27
--------------------------------------

This is the twenty-seventh release of the Linux Native (Sockets) SCTP
from the OpenSS7 Project.  This release, as with other releases, on
builds and installs on 2.4 kernels.  This package is not as important
to the OpenSS7 Project as the STREAMS version of SCTP, which provides
the basis for all of the SIGTRAN components for the OpenSS7 stacks.
Also, the STREAMS version runs on both 2.4 and 2.6 kernels.

This is a stable production release: it deprecates previous releases.
Please upgrade to the current release before reporting bugs.

This is primarily a maintenance release correcting reported bugs, but
also includes the latest packaging improvements.

Major features since the last public release are as follows:

   - Kernel module license made explicit "GPL v2".  And then changed
     back to "GPL".

   - License upgrade to AGPL Version 3.

   - Ability to strap out major documentation build and installation
     primarily for embedded targets.

   - Improvements to common build process for embedded and
     cross-compile targets.


_This is a public stable production grade release of the package: it
deprecates previous releases.  Please upgrade to the current release
before reporting bugs._

As with other OpenSS7 releases, this release configures, compiles,
installs and builds RPMs and DEBs for a wide range of Linux 2.4 and 2.6
RPM- and DPKG-based distributions, and can be used on production
kernels without patching or recompiling the kernel.

This package is publicly released under the `GNU Affero General Public
License Version 3'.  The release is available as an `autoconf' tarball,
SRPM, DSC, and set of binary RPMs and DEBs.  See the downloads page
(http://www.openss7.org/download.html) for the `autoconf' tarballs,
SRPMs and DSCs.  For tarballs, SRPMs, DSCs and binary RPMs and DEBs,
see the sctp package page (http://www.openss7.org/sctp_pkg.html).

See `http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/sctp-0.2.27/ChangeLog' and
`http://www.openss7.org/codefiles/sctp-0.2.27/NEWS' in the release for
more information.  Also, see the `sctp.pdf' manual in the release (also
in html `http://www.openss7.org/sctp_manual.html').

   - Support for Ubuntu 6.10 distribution and bug fixes for i386
     kernels.


 Major changes for release sctp-0.2.24
--------------------------------------

This is the twenty-fourth release of the Linux Native (Sockets) SCTP
from the OpenSS7 Project.  This release, as with other releases, on
builds and installs on 2.4 kernels.  This package is not as important
to the OpenSS7 Project as the STREAMS version of SCTP, which provides
the basis for all of the SIGTRAN components for the OpenSS7 stacks.

This is a stable production release: it deprecates previous releases.
Please upgrade to the current release before reporting bugs.

This is primarily a maintenance release correcting reported bugs, but
also includes the latest packaging improvements.

Following are highlights of some of the changes since the last release:

   - Support for (configure but not build on) most recent 2.6.18
     kernels (including Fedora Core 5 with inode diet patch set).

   - Added `send-pr' scripts for automatic problem report generation.

   - Now builds 32-bit compatibility libraries and tests them against
     64-bit kernel modules and drivers.  The `make installcheck' target
     will now automatically test both 64-bit native and 32-bit
     compatibility versions, one after the other, on 64-bit platforms.

   - Improved compiler flag generation and optimizations for recent
     `gcc' compilers and some idiosyncratic behaviour for some
     distributions (primarily SUSE).

   - Optimized compilation is now available also for user level
     programs in addition to kernel programs.  Added new
     `--with-optimize' option to `configure' to accomplish this.

   - Better detection of SUSE distributions, release numbers and SLES
     distributions: support for additional `SuSE' distributions on
     `ix86' as well as `x86_64'.  Added distribution support includes
     `SLES 9', `SLES 9 SP2', `SLES 9 SP3', `SLES 10', `SuSE 10.1'.

   - Many documentation updates for all OpenSS7 packages.  Automated
     release file generation making for vastly improved and timely text
     documentation present in the release directory.

   - Added `--disable-devel' `configure' option to suppress building
     and installing development environment.  This feature is for
     embedded or pure runtime targets that do not need the development
     environment (static libraries, manual pages, documentation).

   - Added `send-pr' script for automatic problem report generation.

   - Fixed problems with unresolved symbols on some systems.  Fixed
     glaring error in `sctp_init' preventing kernel module from loading.

   - Added init scripts and system control configuration data.  Removed
     old preload approach to kernel module loading.


 Major changes for release sctp-0.2.23
--------------------------------------

Corrections for and testing of 64-bit clean compile and test runs on
x86_64 architecture.  Some bug corrections resulting from gcc 4.0.2
compiler warnings.

Corrected build flags for Gentoo and 2.6.15 kernels as reported on
mailing list.

 Major changes for release sctp-0.2.22
--------------------------------------

This is primarily a bug fixes release and corrections resulting from
testing.  This is a major bug fix release.  The previous release was
largely untested.

 Major changes for release sctp-0.2.21
--------------------------------------

With this release version numbers were changed to reflect an upstream
version only to be consistent with other OpenSS7 package releases.  All
`RPM' release numbers will be `-1$(PACKAGE_RPMEXTRA)' and all `Debian'
release numbers will be `_0'.  If you wish to apply patches and release
the package, please bump up the release number and apply a suitable
release suffix for your organization.  We leave `Debian' release number
`_1' reserved for your use, so you can still bundle the source in the
`.dsc' file.

Improved build process.

Not publicly released.

 Initial release sctp-0.2.20-1
------------------------------

Initial autoconf/RPM packaging of the `sctp' release.

The `OpenSS7 Linux Native SCTP' existed before as a kernel patch for the
Linux kernel.  This is an `autoconf/rpm' packaging release of `Linux
Native SCTP' that builds and installs separate from the Linux kernel
tree.

Not publicly released.
