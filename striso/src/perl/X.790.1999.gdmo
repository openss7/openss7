		!The providerTroubleReport object is created by the agent role CME to 
		specifically notify the manager role CME that planned maintenance will be 
		carried out at a given time and that all or parts of the service(s), 
		resource(s), network or system will be inaccessible during that time. In this 
		case the trouble management function is used to notify the manager that planned 
		maintenance action is scheduled to prevent future trouble.!;


providerTroubleReportBehaviour BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		!In the following text, the term "agent" refers to a system operating in the 
		agent role, and "manager" refers to a system operating in the manager role.

		Only the agent is allowed to create or delete an instance of the Provider 
		Trouble Report managed object class. The manager cannot create or delete an 
		instance of the Provider Trouble Report managed object class. If the manager 
		attempts to create or delete an instance of the Provider Trouble Report managed 
		object class, then the "accessDenied" CMIS error is returned by the agent.

		When the agent creates an instance of the Provider Trouble Report managed object 
		class, the "objectCreation" notification is emitted.

		When the agent deletes an instance of the Provider Trouble Report managed object 
		class, the "objectDeletion" notification is emitted.

		When the agent updates one or several attributes of an instance of the Provider 
		Trouble Report managed object class, the "attributeValueChange" notification is 
		emitted.

		If no specific additional information relative to the Provider Trouble Report 
		managed object instance is known at creation time, then the 
		additionalTroubleInfoList attribute must be set to GraphicString::="".

		The receivedTime attribute is the creation time of the Provider Trouble Report 
		managed object instance.

		If the maintenance has already started at creation time, then the Provider 
		Trouble Report managed object instance must be created with the state set to 
		"open/active". If the maintenance has not started yet at creation time, then the 
		Provider Trouble Report managed object instance must be created with the state 
		set to "queued". In this case the Provider Trouble Report managed object 
		instance will enter the "open/active" state when the maintenance will start. 
		When the maintenance is done, then the Provider Trouble Report managed object 
		instance must enter the "cleared" state. When the Provider Trouble Report 
		managed object instance enters the cleared state, then the "troubleFound" 
		attribute can be set for example to "information" if no specific problems have 
		been detected during the maintenance. The Provider Trouble Report managed object 
		instance will then enter the "closed" state.

		The attributes that can be updated by the agent during the processing of a 
		Provider Trouble Report managed object instance are :

		activityDuration -- when the PTR is in the "cleared" or "closed" state

		additionalTroubleInfoList -- at any time

		agentContactPerson or agentContactObjectPtr -- at any time

		beginTime -- when the PTR is in the "queued" state

		closeOutNarr -- when the PTR is in the "cleared" or "closed" state

		endTime -- when the PTR is not in the "closed" state

		managedObjectInstanceAliasList -- at any time

		relatedTroubleReportList -- at any time

		repairActivityList -- at any time

		restoredTime -- when the PTR is in the "cleared" or "closed" state

		troubleClearancePerson -- according to the attribute"s behaviour

		troubleFound -- when the PTR is in the "cleared" or "closed" state

		troubleLocation -- at any time

		troubleReportNumberList -- at any time

		troubleReportState -- according to the attributes behaviour

		troubleReportStatus -- according to the attribute s behaviour

		troubleReportStatusTime -- when the "troubleReportStatus" is updated.

		The manager cannot update attributes of a Provider Trouble Report managed object 
		instance. If the manager attempts to update one or several attributes of a 
		Provider Trouble Report managed object instance, then the "accessDenied" CMIS 
		error is returned by the agent.

		A value for the troubleReportID attribute can only be provided when the object 
		is created.

		Furthermore, once the object is created, the value of troubleReportID may not be 
		modified (i.e. the instance cannot be renamed).!;
