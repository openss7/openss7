MODULE "ISO/IEC 10733"
-- 6.2 Common Network Layer GDMO Definitions
-- The following templates are referred to from multiple objects.
-- Behaviours

commonCreationDeletion-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		!Managed object class imports the 10165-2 objectCreation and objectDeletion notifications. Used as
		follows:

		objectCreation - Generated whenever an instance of the managed object class is created.
		Implementations may optionally include the sourceIndicator parameter in the notification.

		If creation occured as a result of internal operation of the resource, the value
		'resourceOperation' is used. If creation occured in response to a management operation, the value
		'managementOperation' is used. A value of 'unknown' may be returned if it is not possible to
		determine the source of the operation. None of the other optional parameters are used.

		objectDeletion - Generated whenever an instance of the managed object class is deleted.
		Implementations may optionally include the sourceIndicator parameter in the notification.

		If deletion occured as a result of internal operation of the resource, the value
		'resourceOperation' is used. If deletion occured in response to a management operation, the value
		'managementOperation' is used. A value of 'unknown' may be returned if it is not possible to
		determine the source of the operation. None of the other optional parameters are used.!;


commonStateChange-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		!Managed object class imports the 10165-2 stateChange notification. Used to report the changes to
		the operationalState attribute, and where present, the administrativeState attribute. A single
		parameter set is included in the State change definition field. Only the (mandatory) attributeId
		and (optional) newAttributeValue parameters are used.!;


octetsSentReceivedCounter-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		The octetsSentCounter and octetsReceivedCounter shall count only user data octets in valid data
		packets. They shall not count user data octets in data packets which are rejected for any reason,
		nor user data octets in non data packets;


successfulConnectionEstablishment-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		This Package imports the communicationsInformation notification from "Rec. X.723 | ISO/IEC
		10165-5". It is used to report the following events.

		successfulConnectionEstablishment: Generated when a connection is successfully established.
		However, the precise synchronization between the notification and the corresponding protocol and
		service interface interactions is not defined by this standard. The value
		NLM.successfulConnectionEstablishment shall be reported in the informationType field.;
-- 6.3 The Network Subsystem Managed Object
--	Managed Object for Network Layer Subsystem
--	There is exactly one of these MOs within a system.  It exists to provide a container for the
--	Network Entity MOs, nSAP MOs and the X.25 PLE MOs and IVMOs.
--	The networkSubsystem managed object can not be created or deleted
--	explicitly by management operation. It exists inherently in a system;

cLNS8473PImportedCounters-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		The cLNS8473-P package imports octetsSentCounter and octetsReceivedCounter from DIS
		10165-2. They are used to count the number of octets of data transmitted or received
		by the local network entity in ISO 8473 Data PDUs. (i.e. those which which have a
		source or destination N-Address, respectively, which corresponds to that of the
		local netwerk entity.);


cLNS8473PImportedNotifications-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		The cLNS8473-P package imports the communicationsAlarm notification from Rec. 721 |
		ISO/IEC 10165-2. It is used to report the following cLNS managed object events.

		pDUDiscard: Generated when a data NPDU is discarded due to any of the reasons
		specified in ISO 8473 Table 7, with the exception of `PDU Discarded due to
		Congestion' The header of the PDU in error shall be reported as a parameter in the
		additionalInformation field of the communicationsAlarm, using the
		notificationPDUHeader PARAMETER.

		The significance sub-parameter of each item of additionalInformation shall be set to
		the value `False' (i.e. not significant) so that a managing system receiving the
		event report will be less likely to reject it. The value NLM.pDUDiscard and that
		corresponding to the Reason For Discard shall both be reported in the
		specificProblems parameter.

		The probableCause shall be set to NLM.communicationsProtocolError.

		The perceivedSeverity shall be set to `Minor'. A subsequent communicationsAlarm with
		a perceivedSeverity value of `Cleared' shall not be generated. No other fields or
		parameters shall be used, with the exception of further parameters in the
		AdditionalInformation field. A PDU which does not contain one of the protocol
		identifiers defined in ISO 8473 shall not cause this event.
		A PDU with a protocol ID 1000 0001 shall not cause this event if it does not also
		contain the Version/Protocol Identifier extension in clause 7.2.4 of ISO 8473. If an
		error report PDU is generated, the PDU header and Discard Reason in the error report
		shall be the same as those in the corresponding notification.;


operationalSystemTypeIV-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		If the cLNS MO is created by management operation (using the cLNS-networkEntity-Management name
		binding), the initial value of the operationalSystemType attribute shall be specified in the CMIP
		create. Otherwise, the value shall be determined in an implementation specific manner. The value
		shall be one of those present in the cLNSSystemTypes attribute of the superior Network Entity MO. A
		value of ES indicates that the system shall perform no 8473 forwarding operations upon non-local
		CLN-P PDUs. A value of IS indicates that the system is permitted to perform forwarding operations,
		but the decision to forward individual PDUs, or not to forward them, shall be taken on the basis of
		the available routing information.;

linkage-ISO9542ImportedInformationNotifications-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		This package imports the communicationsInformation notification from Rec. X.723 | ISO/IEC 10165-5.
		It is used to report the following events.

		iSReachabilityChange: Generated when an ES or IS detects a change in the reachability of a
		neighboring IS. The value NLM.iSReachabilityChange shall be reported in the informationType field.
		The new State, NET of the IS concerned, snpaAddress (where available) and the reason for the change
		shall be reported in the informationData field using the reachabilityChange PARAMETER.;


linkage-ISO9542IsImportedInformationNotifications-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		This package imports the communicationsInformation notification from Rec. X.723 | ISO/IEC 10165-5.
		It is used to report the following events.

		eSReachabilityChange: Generated when an IS detects a change in the reachability of a neighboring
		ES. The value NLM.eSReachabilityChange shall be reported in the informationType field. The new
		State, set of NSAPAddresses of the IS concerned, the snpaAddress (where available) and the reason
		for the change shall be reported in the informationData field using the reachabilityChange
		PARAMETER.;


linkage-ISO9542ImportedAlarmNotifications-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		This package imports the communicationsAlarm notification from Rec. X.721 | ISO/IEC 10165-2. It is
		used to report the following events.

		invalid9542PDU: Generated when an ISO 9542 PDU is received which is discarded as result of the PDU
		Header Error Detection or Protocol Error Processing Functions specified in ISO 9542.

		The significance sub-parameter of each item of additionalInformation shall be set to the value
		`False' (i.e. not significant) so that a managing system receiving the event report will be less
		likely to reject it.

		The value NLM.iSO9542PDUDiscard shall be reported in the specificProblems parameter. The
		probableCause shall be set to NLM.communicationsProtocolError.

		The perceivedSeverity shall be set to `Minor'. A subsequent communicationsAlarm with a
		perceivedSeverity value of `Cleared' shall not be generated. No other fields or parameters shall be
		used, with the exception of further parameters in the AdditionalInformation field.;

x25PLEPImportedNotifications-B BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		The x25PLE-P package imports the communicationsAlarm notification from Rec. X.721 | ISO/IEC
		10165-2. It is used to report the following x25PLE managed object events.

		providerInitiatedDisconnect: Issued upon receipt of a clear packet with a cause code other than
		`DTE initiated'.

		The information relating to the packet shall be reported as a parameter in the
		additionalInformation field of the communicationsAlarm, using the notificationData PARAMETER.

		The significance sub-parameter of each item of additionalInformation shall be set to the value
		`False' (i.e. not significant) so that a managing system receiving the event report will be less
		likely to reject it. The value NLM.providerInitiatedDisconnect shall be reported in the
		specificProblems parameter. The probableCause shall be set to NLM.communicationsProtocolError.

		The perceivedSeverity shall be set to `Minor'. A subsequent communicationsAlarm with a
		perceivedSeverity value of `Cleared' shall not be generated. No other fields or parameters shall be
		used, with the exception of further parameters in the AdditionalInformation field.

		remotelyInitiatedReset: Issued upon occurance of a remotely initiated reset. This event is issued
		in lieu of a 'providerInitiatedReset' when operating in a DTE-DXE environment. The information
		relating to the packet shall be reported as a parameter in the additionalInformation field of the
		communicationsAlarm, using the notificationData PARAMETER

		The significance sub-parameter of each item of additionalInformation shall be set to the value
		`False' (i.e. not significant) so that a managing system receiving the event report will be less
		likely to reject it. The value NLM.remotelyInitiatedDisconnect shall be reported in the
		specificProblems parameter. The probableCause shall be set to NLM.communicationsProtocolError.

		The perceivedSeverity shall be set to `Minor'. A subsequent communicationsAlarm with a
		perceivedSeverity value of `Cleared' shall not be generated. No other fields or parameters shall be
		used, with the exception of further parameters in the AdditionalInformation field.

		providerInitiatedReset: Issued upon occurance of a provider initiated reset. This event is issued
		when operating in a DTE-DCE environment. The information relating to the packet shall be reported
		as a parameter in the additionalInformation field of the communicationsAlarm, using the
		notificationData PARAMETER

		The significance sub-parameter of each item of additionalInformation shall be set to the value
		`False' (i.e. not significant) so that a managing system receiving the event report will be less
		likely to reject it. The value NLM.providerInitiatedReset shall be reported in the specificProblems
		parameter. The probableCause shall be set to NLM.communicationsProtocolError.

		The perceivedSeverity shall be set to `Minor'. A subsequent communicationsAlarm with a
		perceivedSeverity value of `Cleared' shall not be generated. No other fields or parameters shall be
		used, with the exception of further parameters in the AdditionalInformation field.

		remotelyInitiatedRestart: Issued upon receipt of a remotely (including provider) initiated restart.

		The information relating to the packet shall be reported as a parameter in the
		additionalInformation field of the communicationsAlarm, using the notificationData PARAMETER

		The significance sub-parameter of each item of additionalInformation shall be set to the value
		`False' (i.e. not significant) so that a managing system receiving the event report will be less
		likely to reject it. The value NLM.remotelyInitiatedRestart shall be reported in the
		specificProblems parameter. The probableCause shall be set to NLM.communicationsProtocolError.

		The perceivedSeverity shall be set to `Minor'. A subsequent communicationsAlarm with a
		perceivedSeverity value of `Cleared' shall not be generated. No other fields or parameters shall be
		used, with the exception of further parameters in the AdditionalInformation field.

		restartCountExceeded: Issued on restart failure due to restart count (R20) exceeded. The
		information relating to the packet shall be reported as a parameter in the additionalInformation
		field of the communicationsAlarm, using the notificationData PARAMETER

		The significance sub-parameter of each item of additionalInformation shall be set to the value
		`False' (i.e. not significant) so that a managing system receiving the event report will be less
		likely to reject it.

		The value NLM.restartCountExceeded shall be reported in the specificProblems parameter. The
		probableCause shall be set to NLM.communicationsProtocolError.

		The perceivedSeverity shall be set to `Minor'. A subsequent communicationsAlarm with a
		perceivedSeverity value of `Cleared' shall not be generated. No other fields or parameters shall be
		used, with the exception of further parameters in the AdditionalInformation field.

		protocolErrorDetectedLocally: Issued upon receipt of a packet which causes the "A=Error" action in
		the ISO 8208 state tables to be taken.

		The information relating to the packet shall be reported as a parameter in the
		additionalInformation field of the communicationsAlarm, using the notificationData PARAMETER.

		The values of cause diagnosand diagnostic codes shall be those which would have been placed in a
		diagnostic packet had one been generated by the DTE (i.e. as if it were a DTE). The actual
		generation of such a packet is not required.

		The significance sub-parameter of each item of additionalInformation shall be set to the value
		`False' (i.e. not significant) so that a managing system receiving the event report will be less
		likely to reject it. The value NLM.communicationsProtocolErrorDetectedLocally shall be reported in

		packet with a cause code equal to `protocol error'. No other x25PLE communication alarm shall be
		generated as a result of this particular instance of packet.

		The information relating to the packet shall be reported as a parameter in the
		additionalInformation field of the communicationsAlarm, using the notificationData PARAMETER
