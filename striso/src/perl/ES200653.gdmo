--All references to managed object classes refer by definition to sub-classes and allomorphic representations.
--The GDMO definition of types is to be used in favour of the ASN.1 definition. For example only four values of the
--Availability Status are specified in the GDMO syntax while the IMPORTED ASN.1 allows the full range of the ISO
--attribute definition. Applying this rule, the additional ASN.1 values are not permitted.

					DEFINED AS
						"The Connectivity object class is a class of managed objects which ensures the

						directionality attribute indicates whether transmission is unidirectional or 
						bi-directional. The mode attribute indicates the type of transmission, i.e. 
						point to point, point to multi-point, multicast, broadcast or conference.

						These are defined as:

						- point to point: there is one A end and one Z end;

						- point to multipoint: there is one A end and multiple Z ends, and there is no 
						  traffic flow between Z ends;

						- multicast: there are multiple A ends and multiple Z ends, and there is no 
						  traffic flow between A ends or between Z ends;

						- conference: the multiple A ends send traffic to, and receive traffic from, all 
						  other A ends, there are no Z ends;

						- broadcast: where there is one A end and no known Z ends.

						Where required, the designation of the Connectivity object should follow ITU-T 
						Recommendation M.1400. The designation is stored in the User Label. The 
						aEndNWTPList attribute and zEndNWTPList attribute are independent of the M.1400 
						designation. For point to point unidirectional and bi-directional, the

						unidirectional and bi-directional, the aEndNWTPList attribute shall identify a

						identify the A end network termination points. There are no Z ends, so the

--class library to give a definitive set of name bindings. In particular the choice as to how a given
--relationship is implemented (e.g. by pointers or name bindings) is the responsibility of the
--application groups. Hence these name bindings are not exhaustive, nor are they prescriptive,
--and additional or alternative name bindings may be defined in ensembles for particular
--applications.

setupSubNetworkConnection ACTION
	BEHAVIOUR
		setupSubNetworkConnectionBehaviour BEHAVIOUR
			DEFINED AS
				"This action is used to set up a Sub-network Connection between network 
				termination points or network GTPs. The termination points to be connected can 
				be specified in one of two ways:

				(1)by explicitly identifying the network termination points or NWGTPs,

				(2)by specifying one or more Topological Points or Access Groups from which any 
				   idle network termination point or NWGTP may be used.

				The result, if successful, always returns an explicit list of NWTPs or NWGTPs. A 
				sub-network connection may be established in any of the following Status 
				Conditions:

				-planned (1)

				-in service, not allocated (2)

				-in service, reserved (4-in service with no spare capacity (8

				-in service with no spare capacity, under test (9).

				Status Condition (8) is the default. Other Status Conditions shall be explicitly 
				expressed in set-up sub-network connection action.

				If it is set up as In Service Reserved, this permits all resources involved in 
				the Sub-network Connection to be reserved in sequence, and when all have been 
				reserved the entire Sub-network Connection may be activated by invoking the 
				action ActivateSubNetworkConnection.The Status condition of all network 
				termination points, Link connections and Sub-network Connections involved in the 
				Sub-network Connection being set up will be the same as that of the composite 
				Subnetwork Connection.

				A single Sub-network Connection object will be created if any of 
				ptoPUnidirectional, ptoPBidirectional, ptoMultipointUni or ptoMultipointBidir 
				modes are selected in this action. The Sub-network Connection object will have 
				one A End and one or more Z Ends.

				For a point-to-point subnetwork connection, the z end is indicated by the 
				zEndNWTPList. For a point-to-multipoint subnetwork connection, the zEndNWTPList 
				is NULL, and the zEnds are indicated by the ZEndNWTP pointer of the leg.

				One Leg object will be created for each Z End in a point to multipoint 
				Sub-network Connection. The Sub-network Connection object points to the NWTPs or 
				NWGTPs involved in the Sub-network Connection. The subNetworkConnectionPointer 
				in the NWTPs or NWGTPs points to the Sub-network Connection object.

				If a Topological Point is involved in the Sub-network Connection, its attributes 
				idleNWCTPCount, and connectedNWCTPCount will be updated as a result of this 
				action. This action will fail if any of the network termination points specified 
				is already involved in a Sub-network Connection or if a NWTP which is part of an 
				existing NWGTP is specified.

				ETSI

				The Sub-network Connection will have a directionality (unidirectional or 
				bidirectional) as specified in the action parameter sncDirectionality. The 
				sncDirectionality parameter also specifies the end points of the Sub-network 
				Connection.

				If any of the underlying resources supporting the Sub-network Connection have a 
				Status condition of Resource Failed with no spare capacity (10c) or Resource 
				Failed, Reserved (10a), the Sub-network Connection shall have the same Status 
				condition.

				If the Sub-network Connection parameters cannot be met by the server, the action 
				response will indicate where possible, these parameters, and the values which 
				can be actually be achieved by the server.

				If used, the quality of connectivity service specifies one pre-determined set of 
				transport parameters which the server may offer. Where a particular quality of 
				transport service level is not available from the server, the action response 
				will indicate the next lowest level in the pre-defined set of levels which is 
				possible. The optional timeout and holdtime parameters are used as part of a 
				two-phase set-up process.

				Timeout is the time allowed to the agent sub-network to respond to the set-up 
				request from the manager. This avoids the manager being slowed down by waiting 
				for unacceptable periods of time for an agent response.

				Holdtime is the time interval which the agent sub-network waits for an activate 
				ACTION once it has entered the reserved state. This allows the agent to free 
				resources if the manager is slow to complete the two phase process. If they are 
				used, transactionId and the identifier of the client will be passed to the 
				server and will be logged by the server against the identifier of the created 
				Sub-network Connection.

				When a bandwidth-scheduled sub-network connection is requested, the bandwidth 
				scheduling parameter is used. The sub-network, will create a 
				subNetworkConnection object instance. That object will have instantiated the 
				package associated for the type of scheduling requested (e.g. weeklySchedulePkg 
				if it requested for a weekly scheduled connection). That package will contain 
				the schedule itself and the appropriate actions to modify the bandwidth schedule 
				(add, delete and modify time slots) without the need of clearing down the 
				connection and re-establishing the sub-network connection

				StartTime Condition

				NULL duration schedule is only vaild CHOICE (i.e.set-up is immediate and has no 
				defined end)

				NULL reservation period begins immediately, and terminates at StopTime

				GeneralizedTime reservation period begins at StartTimeand has no defined end The 
				sub-network shall guarantee that resources will be available when the 
				sub-network connection is due to be activated. The action replies for set-up 
				includes full information about the reasons in case the request could not be 
				satisfied (lack of resources, overlapping time slots, etc.).

				The 'in traffic' condition of the subNetworkConnection is driven by the 
				schedule. A scheduled connection is set-up in the In Service, Not allocated (4) 
				Status Condition. When the schedule indicates that the sub-network connection is 
				to be put in traffic, the Status Condition changes to In Service with no spare 
				capacity (8) (preceded by the In Service with no spare capacity, under test (9) 
				Status Condition if an initial test is made).

				In a two-phase set-up comprising reservation and activation, the he sub-network 
				connection is set-up in the In Service, Reserved (4) Status Condition at the 
				time dictated by the schedule, pending an Activate Action from the manager. The 
				default value of the implicit creation of TPs parameter is FALSE. That is, by 
				default, the sub-network requires NWTPs to be in existence before a sub-network 
				connection can be made. Only if the implicit creation parameter is set to be 
				TRUE in the set-up sub-network connection request, will implicit NWTP creation 
				occur. The identities of the created NWTPs are returned in the result. The 
				EndPno parameter is used when it is necessary to specify a destination PNO when 
				a step-by-step set-up process is used for inter TMN applications.";;
