						- In this Recommendation an instance of current data is assumed to be contained 
						  in the managed object being monitored (such as the trailTerminationPointSink 
						  managed object defined in Recommendation M.3100) and has performance data 
						  pertaining to the containing managed object.

						Performance parameters are modelled as attributes. These attributes either 
						appear explicitly in the definition of subclasses of currentData or the

						currentData.

						Typically, the performance attributes may be derived from the counter attribute

						attributes are defined in CCITT Recommendation X.721. All attributes with a 
						'Count' type syntax (e.g. errored seconds) shall be locally cleared (reset) at 
						the end of the granularity period following the scanning function. To provide 
						continuous counters, the granularityPeriod can be set to an arbitrarily large

				 Transition of the administrativeState attribute to/from the 'lock' state.

				 Transition of the operationalState to/from the 'disabled' state.

				 Scheduler setting that inhibits the collection function.
