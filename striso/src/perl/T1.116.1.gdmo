						that part of a signalling link which is located in one NE.

						The following state and status attributes are supported:

						administrative state:

						- locked: it is administratively not permitted to transport traffic on the link 
						  termination point

						- unlocked: it is administratively permitted to transport user part traffic or 
						  test traffic on the link termination point.

						operational state:

						- enabled: the link termination point is operationally able to transport user 
						  part traffic or test traffic.

						- disabled: the link termination point is operationally unable to transport user 
						  part traffic or test traffic. The operational state is disabled whenever the 
						  link termination point status contains Failed, Deactivated, Local Blocked, 
						  Remote Blocked, or the procedural status is Initializing.

						usage state:

						- idle: the link termination point carries no user part traffic (test traffic 
						  may be present).

						- 'active': The link termination point is not congested. Currently the link 
						  termination point carries user part traffic.

						 - busy: the link termination point is congested due to user part traffic. The 
						 usage state is idle whenever the link termination point status is not empty 
						 i.e. the usage state immediately reflects the availability of the signLinkTp 
						 for user traffic. For national MTP options applying several congestion levels 
						 an additional attribute indicating these levels may be added.

						procedural status:

						- The procedural status initializing is valid during initial alignment 
						  procedure.

						- The procedural status not initialized applies when the link termination point 
						  is not aligned and the initial alignment procedure has not been started.

						Link termination point status.

						This is a set-valued attribute. The following statusses can exist alone or in 
						combinations with each other. The exact definition for each of the following

						destination SP B. The adjacent SP C may be identical with the destination B, or 
						it may or may not be directly interconnected to the destination SP. The adjacent 
						SP C must be directly connected to the near end SP by at least one linkset which 
						is intended to convey MSUs sent from A to B (hence the use of the term 
						'adjacent'). Two signalling routes (A,C,B)i and (A,C,B)j are distinct if the 
						adjacent SP is different. The signRouteNePart Managed Object class defines the 
						management capabilities of the resources which define a specific route segment 
						(Link Set to be traversed) and its priority within the routeset as seen from the 
						own SP.

						A particular signRouteNePart is related to one or more Signalling Routes on the 
						network level. The priority in which the network Signalling Routes are used, is 
						defined by means of assigning priorities to all involved route segments. If from 
						a particular SP two or more route segments are used with the same priority, 
						loadsharing between Signalling Routes may occur. A Combined Link Set is a set of 
						Link Sets used with the same priority by message routing. The signLinkSetTp used 
						for routing is allocated at creation time and cannot be changed during the 
						existence of a particular signRouteNePart.

						The administrativeState attribute describes whether it is administratively 
						permitted to route messages towards the respective destination point via the 
						referenced signLinkSetTp. The operationalState attribute is 'enabled' if both 
						the referenced signLinkSetTp is in the operational state 'enabled' and no TFP 
						message concerning the respective destination has been received from the adjPC 
						of the respective signLinkSetTp.

						The optional usageState attribute is used to cover restriction of a route. Its 
						value is set to 'busy', if the route is restricted ('transfer restricted' is a 
						national option).

						The availabilityStatus attribute gives additional information about the 
						availability of the signRouteNePart instance. It is furthermore needed to map 
						some of the MTP functional states (prohibited: availabilityStatus = 
						{dependency}, restricted: availabilityStatus={degraded}) and is used for the 
						case that the route is locked not by the OS, but e.g. by a local administrator
