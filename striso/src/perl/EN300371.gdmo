-- 5.1.2 European PDH Alarm Indication Signal (AIS) trail termination point
-- This generic object class represents a particular case of termination point used in a managed element where no

-- provided, but a direct adaptation to client is present.
-- The sink object class includes the AIS and LOF monitoring function of a respective Connection Termination Point
-- (CTP) which is not instantiated where no connectivity on the respective level is provided.
-- Object classes inherited from this class are labelled according to the European PDH hierarchy (exATTP, where x = 0
-- stands for 64 kbit/s, x = 1 for 2 Mbit/s, x = 2 for 8 Mbit/s, x = 3 for 34 Mbit/s and x = 4 for 140 Mbit/s.)
-- NOTE: The possibility of adding conditional packages (present if the equipment supports the features) in order to
-- model the capability to reveal Excessive Bit Error Ratio (EBER) is for further study.
-- The subclasses represent two types of combined functions:
-- 1) En/Pne_A [10] and Pne_TT [8]
-- The function En/Pne_A is the adaptation from physical section layer to the client PDH path layer (Pne) and the
-- function Pne_TT terminates the trail in that path layer.
-- 2) Pme/Pne_A and Pne_TT [8]
-- The function Pme/Pne_A adapts from the server PDH path layer (Pme) to a framed, client PDH path layer (Pne)
-- characteristic information (P31e_CI, P22e_CI, P12s_CI). The function Pne_TT terminates the trail in that path
-- layers.
-- In both cases the management information exchanged with the combined functions is identical. As a consequence one
-- object exATTP reflects the management view for the particular PDH path (x=1,2,3,4). Using the objects exATTP a
-- PDH interface can be represented by a fewer number of instances than is obtained if objects are used which do not
-- represent combined functions. These alternative representations are shown in figure 5 and figure 4, respectively.

			DEFINED AS
				"Any object supporting this package can support the portMode function. It has

				In the AUTO state the value of the portMode attribute is AUTO and the containing 
				managed object's alarmSeverityAssignmentProfilePointer attribute shall point at 
				the instance of the AlarmSeverityAssignmentProfile managed object class which 
				has a nameBinding value of 
				defaultNMONAlarmSeverityAssignmentProfile-managedElement.

				In the NMON state the value of the portMode is NMON and the containing managed 
				object's alarmSeverityProfilePointer attribute shall point at the same instance 
				as in AUTO mode, i.e. it points to the AlarmSeverityAssignmentProfile managed 
				object class which has a nameBinding value of

				In the MON state the value of the portMode is MON and the containing managed 
				object's alarmSeverityAssignmentProfilePointer attribute shall has a value 
				indicating some other AlarmSeverityAssignmentProfile instance than the one used 
				in NMON/AUTO state or it should be NULL. When portMode changes from AUTO or NMON 
				to MON the alarmSeverityAssignmentProfilePointer shall revert to the value as 
				stated above.

				The MON, NMON or AUTO state is entered via M-Set of the portMode attribute by a 
				managing system. In addition, the containing object leaves the AUTO state when a 
				valid signal is detected (i.e. LOS is cleared) by the containing object, and in 
				this case an attributeValueChange notification is emitted. An attempt from 
				management system to change the portMode attribute from either MON or NMON to 
				AUTO is rejected, when there is a valid signal.

alarmReportingControlBehaviour BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		"If the attribute alarmSeverityProfilePointer points to an instance of the MOC 
		alarmSeverityAssignmentProfile then the perceivedSeverity associated with the 
		probableCause in the communicationsAlarm is determined by the assignment given 
		in the attribute alarmSeverityAssignmentList of that instance. The value 
		'non-alarmed' of the severity assigned to a problem inhibits the emission of the 
		potential communicationsAlarm notification of that problem. This behaviour meets 
		the ability to configure the defect correlation filter not to report selected 
		fault causes (i.e. problems) and hence no associated failures will be alerted by 
		communicationsAlarm notifications.

		The alarmSeverityProfilePointer may point to an instance of 
		alarmSeverityAssignmentProfile which is auto-created by the NE according the 
		name-binding label 'defaultNMONAlarmSeverityAssignmentmanagedElement'. This 
		relationship of the termination point reflects the NMON state during which no 
		communicationsAlarm is reported at all.

		When the severity changes to a value 'non-alarmed' for a problem which has been 
		notified by an instance of this class then a communicationsAlarm notification 
		with the perceivedSeverity 'cleared' is issued and the corresponding entry in 
		the attributes currentProblemList and alarmStatus is removed. When the severity 
		changes from 'non-alarmed' to a value other than 'non-alarmed' then a pending, 
		persistent defect will be notified.

		If the alarm severity cannot be assigned by the way of an 
		alarmSeverityAssignmentProfile object (e.g. the attribute 
		alarmSeverityProfilePointer has the value NULL or no assignment is given in the 
		attribute alarmSeverityAssignmentList) then one of the two choices applies when 
		reporting alarms:

		a) agent assigns the severity,

		b) the value 'indeterminate' is used.";

		farEndReceiverFailure (fERF) [3]. Detection of a fERF has no effect on the 
		operationalState.

		Instances of the subclasses of this class may be used at the different PDH path 
		layers to provide with performance data monitoring capabilities based on Frame 
		Alignment Signal Errors (FASE) [8].";
