sdhCurrentDataBehaviour BEHAVIOUR
	DEFINED AS
		"The sdhCurrentData class is used to define generic characteristic for SDH 
		performance monitoring from which subclasses are defined in order to hold 
		performance event counts for a specific monitoring point. Subclasses of this 
		class are used in order to support performance monitoring of SDH paths at 
		various layers as described in Recommendation G.803. The performance monitoring 
		events ES, SES and BBE which are monitored by some of the subclasses of this 
		subclass are defined in 4.1.1/G.826. The granularityPeriod attribute can only be 
		assigned a value at creation time.

		This class can only contain one reference to an instance of the thresholdData 
		object class in the thresholdDataInstance attribute.

		The 15' and 24 hours granularity period must be supported fully. If a threshold 
		is reached or crossed then the currentProblemList attribute shall indicate it 
		with the probable cause 'Threshold crossed'. Subclass of this class is used to 
		monitor the near end of the path in case of bidirectional path the far end of 
		the path shall be supported additionaly. In case of monitoring of a 
		bidirectional path and Far End unavailability is monitored, an unavailable 
		period starts if either the near end or the far end is in an unavailable 
		condition. In case of monitoring of a unidirectional path only the near end is 
		considered.

		An unavailable condition starts when 10 consecutive severely errored seconds 
		have been detected; these 10 seconds belong to the unavailable time. An 
		unavailable condition ends when 10 consecutive seconds with no severely errored 
		second are detected. These 10 seconds belong to the available time. The 
		unavailable period entry/exit criteria are described in Annex A/G.826.

		For threshold reset subclasses of this object class the following rules apply:

		- No more than one QOS alarm shall be generated until there has been a 15-minute 
		  rectangular fixed window with less error count than the low error count 
		  threshold and no unavailable period exists.

		- To provision the high and low threshold value, the 
		  counterThresholdAttributList attribute of the Q.822-ThresholdDataInstance is 
		  used.

		In this attribute all the thresholds (high and low) for each necessary counter 
		are stored in a list. This means for example, that the high threshold for ES and 
		the low threshold for ES are individually stored in the same list. It is up to 
		the network element to recognize which is the high and which is the low one.

		If the unavailableTimeAlarmPackage is present and if an unavailable period 
		starts, then a communication alarm shall be sent with a probable cause of 
		'Unavailable' and the presence of this unavailable condition is indicated by the 
		currentProblemList attribute. If an unavailable period is ending, then a 
		communication alarm shall be sent with a probable cause of 'Unavailable' and a 
		severity of 'Cleared'. An available condition is indicated by the absence of the 
		unavailable condition in the current problem list. The unavailable condition has 
		no effect on the operationalState. Each subclass of this class shall define the 
		performance attributes required to hold the mandatory or optional performance 
		events. These performance event counts are inhibited during unavailable time. 
		Attributes which are defined in a subclass of this class shall be included in 
		history information using the historyData, or one of its subclass, unless it is 
		explicitly specified in the subclass of this class that a particular attribute 
		be not included. Each subclass of this class shall indicate which subclass of 
		the history data is used for history retention. The following conditional 
		packages are not used in this class: filterSuppressionPkg, 
		observedManagedObjectPkg.

		Concerning the subclasses of this class the following rule applies:

		If a subclass of this class has a granularity period of 15 minutes, it should be 
		either an instance with the threshold reset functionality or an instance without 
		this functionality instantiated (per termination point), but not both.";
