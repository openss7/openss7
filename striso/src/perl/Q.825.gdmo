MODULE "ITU-T Rec. Q.825 (1998)" { itu-t(0) recommendation(0) q(17) q825(825) }
-- ANNEX A
-- Information model
-- A.1 Overview
-- This Annex contains the formal description of the information model for this Recommendation. It
-- consists of a simplified Entity-Relationship (ER) model by way of introduction, together with an
-- object model specified in terms of the GDMO templates defined in Recommendation X.722
-- "Guidelines for the Definition of Managed Objects".
-- The generation of usage metering records is controlled by the Usage Metering Control object
-- together with the optional triggering objects.
-- The notifications generated by the Usage Metering Data object presented to the EFD may also be
-- logged locally within the NE. Each managed NE may contain a usage metering record log.
-- The usage metering record log may contain one or more usage metering log entries each of which in
-- turn contains one or more usage metering record notifications.
-- A.2 Naming hierarchy
-- The naming (containment) tree for the objects defined within this Annex is illustrated in Figure A.2
-- below. It should be noted that all of the object classes are shown relative to the "managedElement".
-- A.3 Inheritance
-- The inheritance tree for this specification is illustrated in Figure A.3. The object classes "log",
-- "logRecord", "eventLogRecord", and "eventForwardingDiscriminator" are defined in
-- Recommendation X.721.
-- A.4 Managed object classes
-- A.4.1 Block Generating Log
-- This managed object class is a subclass of the "Log" class described in Recommendation X.735 and
-- defined in Recommendation X.721 and therefore inherits all of the properties of the "log" class.

						following events occurs:

						 the number of records in the log becomes equal to the maximum block size,

						 the time interval elapsed since the first record currently contained in the 
						  log exceeds the value maxTimeInterval attribute,

						 an internal system limitation has been exceeded, including the blocking log 
						  itself overflowing.

						Upon emitting the block record notification all records stored in the blocking 
						log are deleted and the log is ready to store new records. Because of the 
						self-emptying nature of this log, any log-full action may be selected and the 
						behavior of the log will not change.";;
