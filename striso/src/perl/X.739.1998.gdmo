						The mean and min max monitor managed object calculates estimates of the mean,

						the mean. The initial value for the estimate of the smallest is also set equal 
						to the initial value for the estimate of the mean. For each granularity period, 
						if the derived gauge value is less than the current estimate of the smallest, 
						then the estimate of the smallest is set equal to this new value. If the derived 
						gauge value is greater than the current estimate of the largest, then the 
						estimate of the largest is set equal to this new value. The estimate of largest 
						and estimate of smallest attribute values are placed in the monitored attributes 
						parameter of the quality of service alarm notification.!;;

						8.1.7.3Behaviour of the mean and percentile monitor

						This metric object calculates the estimate of the mean and percentiles of the 
						values of the derived gauge. PCT is an integer with a value from 1 to 49 
						inclusive. If the configurable percentile package is not present, PCT shall be 
						25, and the number of replications attribute shall be set by the manager to 8, 
						16 or 32.

						The mean of the derived gauge (in the estimate of mean attribute inherited from 
						the mean monitor), estimate of median,estimate of largest in a replication, 
						estimate of smallest in a replication, estimate of 100-PCTth percentile, and 
						estimate of the PCTth percentile are calculated using the exponentially weighted 
						moving average (EWMA) algorithm as described in B.2.2 and B.2.4.

						The percentile estimates are only updated after a number of replications are 
						observed, with one replication per granularity period. The estimate of mean is 
						updated and the thresholds (if present) are applied at each granularity period. 
						When the mean and percentile monitor metric object is created, the following 
						shall be specified:

						- The moving time period (MTP) and second moving time period (SMTP) required by 
						  the EWMA algorithms;

						- The EWMA gauge mean and EWMA gauge percentile behaviours are included and the 
						  initial value for the estimate of mean, estimate of largest in a replication, 
						  estimate of smallest in a replication, estimate of median, estimate of 100-PCT 
						  percentile, estimate of PCT percentile, number of replications, and time 
						  between replications attributes shall be specified.

						Estimate of largest in replication, estimate of smallest in replication, 
						estimate of median, estimate of 100-PCT percentile,estimate of PCT percentile, 
						number of replications, and granularity period attribute values are placed in 
						the monitored attributes parameter of the quality of service alarm notification.

						The second moving time period attribute and attributes of the configurable 
						percentile package may only be modified if the administrative state is locked. 
						If the attribute value change notification package is present, modifications of 
						these attributes shall result in an attribute value change notification.!;,

						B.2.4 EWMA gauge percentile behaviour

						The metric algorithms defined in this sub-clause include estimates of the 
						smallest in a sample of size M, the largest in a sample of size M, the median, 
						the PCTth percentile, and the 100-PCTth percentile of the relative frequency 
						distribution of the observed attribute of the observed managed object. By 
						definition, the Kth percentile is the pth fractile for p = K/100. For reasons of 
						economy of notation, the fractile notation is used.

						The procedure for calculation of percentile estimates are carried out in two 
						phases:

						- a set of M replications of the gauge is obtained, and coarse estimates are 
						  calculated for the percentiles (as specified in B.2.4.1);

						- each of these coarse estimates are applied in turn to an EWMA algorithm to 
						  derive smoothed estimates of percentiles, which are used to update the metric 
						  output attributes (as specified in B.2.4.2).

						NOTE - Since percentiles are calculated for 100-PCT, when PCT is close to zero, 
						those percentiles are correspondingly close to 100 (e.g. 98th percentile). For 
						these large percentiles, if the distribution is such that there is a long tail, 
						the coarse estimates may be significantly biased. The EWMA smoothing does not 
						reduce this bias. Alternatives to reduce this bias are for further study.!;;

				8.1.7.2 Attributes and packages of the mean and percentile monitor

				The mean and percentile monitor managed object class has the following 
				attributes:

				a) Second moving time period

				   This attribute is used in calculating the time constant for calculating the 
				   percentiles used in the EWMA. It represents the effective time interval over 
				   which values are scanned to calculate an estimate of the percentile. (It is 
				   used in the calculation of "h" in the calculations for percentiles as 
				   described in B.2.1and B.2.4.) This attribute shall be initialised when the 
				   metric object is created and may be modified.

				      NOTE - The value of this attribute should be greater than or equal to the 
				      value of the granularity periodattribute.

				b) Estimate of largest in replication

				   This attribute contains the calculated estimate of the largest value in a 
				   replication of size equal to thevalue of the number of replications 
				   attribute.

				c) Estimate of smallest in replication

				   This attribute contains the calculated estimate of the smallest value in a 
				   replication of size equal to thevalue of the number of replications 
				   attribute.

				d) Estimate of median

				   This attribute contains the calculated estimate of the median value.

				e) Estimate of 100-PCT percentile

				   This attribute contains the calculated estimate of the one hundred minus 
				   PCTth percentile.

				f) Estimate of PCT percentile

				   This attribute contains the calculated estimate of the PCTth percentile.

				g) Number of Replications

				   This attribute contains the number of repeated statistically independent 
				   samples (replications) to be usedfor the calculations. The number of 
				   replications is represented by "M" in equations defining percentile 
				   calculations. See Annex B.

				The mean and percentile monitor metric object has the following conditional 
				package:

				- configurable percentile package, as defined in 8.1.9.8 (present if 
				  configurable percentile calculation isrequired.)!;

						8.1.6.3 Behaviour of the mean and variance monitor

						This managed object calculates estimates of the mean and variance on the values 
						of the derived gauge. The estimated mean of the derived gauge (in estimate of 
						mean attribute inherited from the mean monitor), and variance(estimate of 
						variance) are calculated using the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) 
						algorithm. (See B.2.2 and B.2.3.) The estimate of variance attribute is placed 
						in the monitored attributes parameter of the quality of service alarm 
						notification.

						When the mean and variance monitor metric object is created, the following shall 
						be specified:

						- The moving time period and second moving time period required by the EWMA 
						  algorithm;

						- The EWMA gauge mean and EWMA gauge variance behaviours are included and the 
						  initial value for the estimate of mean and estimate of variance shall be 
						  specified.

						The second moving time period attribute may only be modified if the 
						administrative state is locked.

						If the attribute value change notification package is present, modification of 
						this attribute shall result in an attribute value change notification.!;,

					DEFINED AS

						 B.2.3 EWMA gauge variance behaviour

						This algorithm calculates the estimate of the variance of the values of a gauge 
						using the EWMA algorithm. This algorithm shall be used in combination with the 
						EWMA gauge mean algorithm which is used to calculate W n.

						The EWMA variance estimate is defined by the following iterative algorithm:

						   Sn = g * (Vn - Wn)2 + (1 - g) * Sn-1

						where

						   Sn is an estimate of the variance of Vn.

						   Sn-1 is the previous estimate of the variance.

						   S 0 may be initialized by setting the attribute representing the estimate of 
						   variance.

						NOTES

						1. The values of GP and SMTP can be reset by the managing system.

						2. This algorithm has a predictable bias which can be shown to be:

						   u = 2 * (1-f)2/(2-f), times the variance of Vn - Wn.

						   These factors can be used to reduce a small amount of bias that is introduced 
						   into the calculations, (e.g. for f = 0.05,u z. 0.93), which may be used in 
						   the following equation:

						   Sc'n = Sn/u

						   This calculation may be performed by managing systems to correct any bias in 
						   variance calculations. Alternatively, the bias may be ignored by managing 
						   systems if it is considered negligible.

						3. The units of S are the same as the units of V squared.!;;

						8.1.3.3 Behaviour of the mean monitor

						The estimate of mean attribute has the same units as the derived gauge 
						attribute. The estimate of the mean of the derived gauge attribute is provided 
						by the estimate of mean attribute. The algorithm usedto evaluate the estimate of 
						the mean value is not specified. However, the time period that is used in the 
						evaluation of the mean value is specified by the moving time period attribute.

						    NOTE - Examples of two algorithms that may be used to do this are EWMA and 
						    UWMA as specified in Annexes B and C.

						There are two conditional packages used to apply thresholds to the value of 
						derived gauge and estimate of mean attributevalues. If the derived 
						gauge-threshold package (inherited from the monitor metric managed object class) 
						is present, the severity indicating gauge-threshold is applied to the value of 
						the derived gauge attribute. If the estimate of the meanthreshold package is 
						present, the estimate of mean severity indicating gauge-threshold is applied to 
						the value of the estimate of mean attribute. The managed object will emit a 
						quality of service alarm notification whenever the value of the derived gauge or 
						the estimate of the mean attribute triggers the corresponding threshold.

						If either of the threshold packages is present, then the conditional specific 
						problems indication package may also bepresent. If the specific problems 
						indication package is present then the specific problems indicator attribute 
						value shall be placed in the specific problems parameter of the quality of 
						service notifications that are emitted, whether they aretriggered by either the 
						derived gauge attribute or by the estimate of mean attribute.

						When the mean monitor metric object is created, the moving time period required 
						by the mean estimation algorithm shall be specified. When the mean monitor 
						metric object is created, the estimate of mean severity indicating 
						gauge-threshold levels (i.e. the threshold levels to be applied to the estimate 
						of mean attribute value for generation of quality of service alarm 
						notifications) may be specified. In addition, the presence of the derived gauge 
						time stamp package requires metric object instances to report the derived gauge 
						time stamp attribute as part of the monitored attributes parameter of the 
						quality of service alarm notification.

						The use of the quality of service alarm notification parameters is given in 
						8.2.1. The value of the estimate of mean attribute will be in the observed value 
						element of the threshold information parameterof the quality of service alarm 
						notification.

						The values of the observed object instance and observed attribute identifier 
						will be in the monitored attributes parameterof the quality of service alarm 
						notification. The moving time period attribute, estimate of the mean attribute 
						and attributes of the estimate of mean threshold andspecific problems indication 
						packages may only be modified if the administrative state is locked. If the 
						attribute value change notification package is present, modifications of these 
						attributes shall result in an attribute value changenotification.!;;

						8.1.2.3 Behaviour of the monitor metric

						The monitor metric managed object monitors values of an attribute in an observed 
						managed object. The observed attribute is monitored at intervals specified by 
						the granularity period. A gauge value (derived gauge) is derived from the values 
						of the observed attribute. The value of the derived gauge attribute shall remain 
						the same until the next observation.

						The presence or absence of the difference packages (i.e. counter difference and 
						gauge difference) determines how the output of the data conversion process is 
						derived from the observed attribute. If neither package is present, the derived 
						gauge attribute value contains the last observed value of the observed 
						attribute. If either of the difference packages is present, the derived gauge 
						value contains the value of the difference between two successive observations 
						of observed attribute value. If a difference package is not present, the units 
						of the derived gauge are the same as the units of the observed attribute. If a 
						difference package is present, the units of the derived gauge is related to the 
						interval between observations(granularity period). For example, if the derived 
						gauge has a value of 60 and the observed attribute is a counter of the number of 
						messages, with the granularity period at 15 minutes, the derived gauge 
						represents a value of 60 messages per15 minutes.

						The presence of the derived gauge time stamp package requires monitor metric 
						instances to update the derived gauge time stamp attribute with the current 
						time, whenever the derived gauge attribute value is updated. If the derived 
						gauge-threshold package is present, the severity indicating gauge-threshold in 
						the package is applied to the derived gauge attribute, and a threshold crossed 
						quality of service alarm notification will be emitted when the derived gauge 
						value crosses the threshold values. In addition, the presence of the derived 
						gauge time stamp package requires managed object instances to report the derived 
						gauge time stamp attribute as part of the monitored attributes parameter of any 
						quality of service alarm notification. The quality of service alarm notification 
						parameters shall be as specified in 8.2.1. The value of the derived gauge 
						attribute shall be in the observed value element of the threshold information 
						parameter of the quality of service alarm notification. The values of the 
						observed object instance and observed attribute identifier shall be in the 
						monitored attributes parameter of the quality of service alarm notification.

						If the conditional specific problems indication package is present, the specific 
						problems indicator attribute value (used to specify a specific type of metric 
						monitoring) shall be placed into the specific problems parameter of the 
						threshold crossed quality of service alarm notification. The observed attribute 
						is specified by the observed attribute identifier of the managed object 
						identified by observed object instance. If the counter difference package is 
						absent, the observed attribute is treated as a gauge. If the gauge difference 
						package is present, the observed attribute is treated as a gauge. When the 
						monitor metric managed object is created, the following shall be specified:

						- the scanner Id, observed object instance, observed attribute identifier;

						- the granularity period (i.e. time between observations of the observed 
						  attribute);

						 - if the counter difference package is present, then the data conversion 
						 process is calculated according to the counter difference package behaviour;

						- if the counter overflow package is present, then the metric object shall 
						  ensure that the value of the modulus value attribute is initialized before 
						  entering the on-duty condition.;

						- if the gauge difference package is present, then the data conversion process 
						  is calculated according to the gauge difference package behaviour;

						- a choice of at most one of the available scheduling packages. The scheduling 
						  packages are defined in CCITT Rec. X.721 | ISO/IEC 10165-2;

						- if the derived gauge-threshold package is present, then the severity 
						  indicating gauge-threshold (i.e. the threshold levels to be applied to the 
						  derived gauge attribute value for generation of quality of service alarm 
						  notifications) shall be specified; and

						- if the observed attribute identifier references an attribute that is not of 
						  real or integer type, the creation shall fail and the CMIS error "invalid 
						  attribute value" shall be returned.

						If the state change notification package is present, then changes to the 
						administrative state, operational state, and availability status shall cause 
						state change notifications to be emitted.

						The lifetime of the metric object may be controlled by the managing system by 
						requesting the managed system to delete the metric object. If the managed system 
						deletes a metric object and the create delete notifications package is present, 
						a notification indicating managed object deletion is emitted. The notification 
						shall include the values of the attributes of the metric object at the time of 
						deletion.

						Attributes of the counter difference, counter overflow, gauge difference, 
						derived gauge-threshold, and specific problems indication packages may only be 
						modified if the administrative state is locked. If the attribute value change 
						notification package is present, then modifications of these attributes shall 
						result in an attribute value change notification.!;;

						8.1.1.3 Behaviour of the scanner

						A managed object of this class represents the ability to retrieve values of 
						attributes of managed objects and produce summary information from those values. 
						This summary information may be made available in attributes, notifications, 
						action replies, or some combination of these. Summary information may consist of 
						observed attribute values or statistics calculated from these values (either 
						over time or over managed objects).

						Observed attribute values are retrieved during a "scan", which is initiated 
						periodically, at the end of each granularity period, provided that the 
						granularity period is non-zero. The granularity period attribute indicates the 
						length of the granularity period. The granularity period in the scanner managed 
						object class shall not be modified unless the value of the administrative state 
						is "locked". If the period synchronization package is not present, the time at 
						which a granularity period starts after the scanner is unlocked is a local 
						matter.

						The administrative state attribute is used to suspend or resume the scanning 
						function. If administrative state has the value"unlocked", the scanner is 
						administratively permitted to perform scans. If administrative state has the 
						value "locked", the scanner is administratively prohibited from performing 
						scans. The operational state attribute represents the operational capability of 
						the scanner to perform its functions.

						If present, the availability status attribute indicates whether the schedule 
						inhibits the scanning function, consistent with the description of the 
						availability status attribute in CCITT Rec. X.731 | ISO/IEC 10164-2. The 
						scanning function can be suspended or resumed according to a schedule. If the 
						schedule suspends the scanning function, any scan that is in progress continues. 
						If the period synchronization package is present, the period synchronization 
						time attribute, contained in this package, issued to determine the time to which 
						the granularity period is synchronized. The period synchronization time 
						attribute shall not be modified unless the value of the administrative state is 
						locked. The start of each granularity period is an integral number of 
						granularity periods before or after the time specified by this attribute.

						If the attribute value change notification package is present, then changes to 
						the granularity period or to the period synchronization time shall cause 
						attribute value change notifications to be emitted. If the state change 
						notification package is present, then changes to the operational state or 
						administrative state shall cause state change notifications to be emitted.

						NOTES

						1. It is assumed that the observed attributes can be scanned within the 
						   granularity period. If a scan is initiated when another scan is in progress, 
						   then how the conflict is resolved is a local issue.

						2. The scan may occur at slightly different times for each observed attribute, 
						   but the time skew between the start of a scan and the scan time for a given 
						   attribute in the scan should be approximately equal between successive scans.!;;

				8.1.9.8 Configurable percentile package

				8.1.9.8.1Overview

				The configurable percentile package is used to allow a change from the default 
				value of PCT. A particular value for PCT can be set so that the PCTth and 
				100-PCTth percentiles can be calculated.

				8.1.9.8.2 Attributes of the configurable percentile package

				The configurable percentile package contains the following attribute:

				- Configurable PCT

				  This attribute contains the value of PCT used in the percentile calculations.

				8.1.9.8.3 Behaviour of the configurable percentile package

				Estimates of the percentiles are obtained by taking a set of statistically 
				independent samples of the observations of V[t]within a specified time interval 
				and sorting these statistically independent observations of V[t] from smallest 
				to largest.

				Repeated statistically independent samples are called replications. If the 
				configurable percentile package is not present, PCT shall be 25, and the number 
				of replications attribute shall be 8,16 or 32. If the configurable percentile 
				package is present, PCT shall take the value of the configurable PCT attribute, 
				and the number of replications shall admit arbitrary values (typically greater 
				than 32 for PCT < 25, with a larger number of replications required for good 
				performance for smaller PCT values).!;;

			DEFINED AS
				!See 8.1.9.1.3.

				8.1.9.1.3 Behaviour of the counter difference package

				If this package is included in a managed object, the observed attribute shall be 
				a counter. The gauge value derived is initially calculated using the following 
				equation:

				  V[t] = [counter[t] - counter[t-GP]] where

				    V[t] is the difference between successive observations of the counter;

				    counter[t] is the value of the counter at the current time t (not saved in 
				    any attribute);

				    counter[t-GP] is the previous value of the counter at time t-GP (i.e. 
				    previous scan counter value);

				    GP is the sampling interval in seconds, minutes, hours, or days (i.e. 
				    granularity period).

				The initial value of previous scan counter value determines the initial 
				difference value. The value of the previous scan counter value attribute is 
				considered valid if it was obtained at the end of the previous granularity 
				period. Thus, for example, it is not considered valid in the first scan interval 
				subsequent to creation, in the first scan interval subsequent to transition from 
				"unlocked" to "locked" states or subsequent to transition from "off-duty"to 
				"on-duty" states.

				During the period in which the value of the previous scan counter value 
				attribute is not valid, the value of the procedural status attribute shall have 
				the value "Not initialized". During this period, the value of the derived gauge 
				attribute is not usable as input to subsequent data enhancement or data analysis 
				algorithms, and any attempt to read either the derived gauge attribute or the 
				previous scan counter value attribute will result in the retrieval of invalid 
				information.

				If the value of the previous scan counter value attribute is valid, and

				- if V[t] (i.e. the difference between successive observations) is not negative 
				  then the value of derived gauge is set to V[t];

				- if V[t] is negative and the counter overflow package (see 8.1.9.2) is present 
				  in the managed object then the derived gauge value is calculated according to 
				  the behaviour specified in 8.1.9.2.3;

				- if V[t] is negative and the counter overflow package is not present in the 
				  managed object, then the derived gauge is set to V[t]. This negative value of 
				  the derived gauge attribute is not usable as input to subsequent data 
				  enhancement or data analysis algorithms. The observed value is retained by the 
				  metric object to be used in calculating the next difference, i.e. it becomes 
				  the value of the previous scan counter value attribute.

				During the period after which the previous scan counter value attribute is 
				initialized but before the end of next granularity period, the value of the 
				procedural status attribute shall have the value "Initializing". During this 
				period, the value of the derived gauge attribute is not usable as input to 
				subsequent data enhancement or data analysis algorithms,and any attempt to read 
				the derived gauge attribute will result in the retrieval of invalid information.!;;

				8.1.9.3.3 Behaviour of the gauge difference package

				The derived gauge value is initially calculated using the following equation:

				  V[t] = gauge[t] - gauge[t-GP] where

				    V[t] is the difference between successive observations of the gauge;

				    gauge[t] is the value of the gauge at the current time t (not saved in any 
				    attribute);

				    gauge[t-GP] is the value of the gauge at time t minus GP (i.e. the value of 
				    the previous scan gauge value attribute);

				    GP is the sampling interval in seconds, minutes, hours, or days (i.e. 
				    granularity period).

				The initial value of the previous scan gauge value attribute determines the 
				initial difference value. The value of the previous scan gauge value attribute 
				is considered valid if it was obtained at the previous granularity period. Thus, 
				for example, it is not considered valid in the first scan interval subsequent to 
				creation, in the first scan interval subsequent to transition from "unlocked" to 
				"locked" states or subsequent to transition from "off-duty" to "on-duty" states.

				During the period in which the value of the previous scan gauge value attribute 
				is not valid, the value of the procedural status attribute shall have the value 
				"Not initialized". During this period, the value of the derived gauge attribute 
				is not usable as input to subsequent data enhancement or data analysis 
				algorithms, and any attempt to read either the derived gauge attribute or the

				information.

				The observed value is retained by the metric object to be used in calculating 
				the next difference, i.e., it becomes the value of the previous scan gauge value 
				attribute. During the period after which the previous scan gauge value attribute 
				is initialized but before the end of next granularity period, the value of the 
				procedural status attribute shall have the value "Initializing". During this

				object class shall not be modified unless the value of the administrative state 
				is "locked". If the period synchronization package is not present, the time at 
				which a granularity period starts after the scanner is unlocked is alocal 
				matter.

				The administrative state attribute is used to suspend or resume the scanning 
				function. If administrative state has the value"unlocked", the scanner is 
				administratively permitted to perform scans. If administrative state has the 
				value "locked", the scanner is administratively prohibited from performing 
				scans. The operational state attribute represents the operational capability of 
				the scanner to perform its functions.

				If present, the availability status attribute indicates whether the schedule 
				inhibits the scanning function, consistent withthe description of the 
				availability status attribute in CCITT Rec. X.731 | ISO/IEC 10164-2. The 
				scanning function can be suspended or resumed according to a schedule. If the 
				schedule suspends the scanningfunction, any scan that is in progress continues. 
				If the period synchronization package is present, the period synchronization 
				time attribute, contained in this package, isused to determine the time to which 
				the granularity period is synchronized. The period synchronization time 
				attribute shall not be modified unless the value of the administrative state is 
				locked. The start of each granularity period is anintegral number of granularity 
				periods before or after the time specified by this attribute.

				If the attribute value change notification package is present, then changes to 
				the granularity period or to the periodsynchronization time shall cause 
				attribute value change notifications to be emitted. If the state change 
				notification package is present, then changes to the operational state or 
				administrative state shall cause state change notifications tobe emitted.

				NOTES

				1. It is assumed that the observed attributes can be scanned within the 
				   granularity period. If a scan is initiated whenanother scan is in progress, 
				   then how the conflict is resolved is a local issue.

				2. The scan may occur at slightly different times for each observed attribute, 
				   but the time skew between the start of ascan and the scan time for a given 
				   attribute in the scan should be approximately equal between successive scans.!;;

				8.1.9.4.2 Attributes of the derived gauge-threshold package

				The derived gauge-threshold package contains the following attribute:

				- Severity indicating gauge-threshold

				  This attribute contains the threshold levels which are to be applied to the 
				  derived gauge attribute. It shall be initialised when the managed object in 
				  which it is included is created and may be modified. The attribute is 
				  set-valued to allow multiple threshold levels to be specified. An optional 
				  parameter is used toassociate the threshold level to the severity parameter of 
				  the emitted notification. The generation of the notification can be switched 
				  off using the boolean parameter notify-on-off. The severity parameter 
				  ismandatory if notify-on-off is "true".

				  This attribute has similar behaviour to the gauge-threshold attribute defined 
				  in CCITT Rec. X.721 |ISO/IEC 10165-2 for triggering the related notifications. 
				  The syntax has an added parameter for indicating the associated severity to 
				  the notification triggered by the crossing of the correspondingthreshold 
				  level. As an enhancement to the syntax of the gauge-threshold attribute type 
				  it adds an optional severity indication parameter to the syntax of both the 
				  notify-high and notify-low submembers withineach threshold level member.

				  This attribute type has additional behaviour associated with these optional 
				  perceived severity indication parameters, which is defined as follows:

				   - If the notify-high's switch is on (true), the notify-high's severity 
				   indication value shall be reported inthe perceived severity parameter of a 
				   notification triggered by the gauge value crossing the notifyhigh's 
				   gauge-threshold value in the positive going direction.

				   - If the notify-low's switch is on (true), the notify-low's severity 
				   indication value shall be reported inthe perceived severity parameter of a 
				   notification triggered by the gauge value crossing the notifylow's 
				   gauge-threshold value in the negative going direction.

				  If both switches are on (true) for a single threshold level, one of the 
				  severity indication values shallbe "clear". The severity indicating 
				  gauge-threshold shall only emit a clear event notification if the 
				  corresponding threshold level (either notify-high or notify-low) notification 
				  has been emitted and noother clear notification for this threshold level pair 
				  has been emitted since the previous corresponding threshold level notification 
				  has been emitted.!;;
