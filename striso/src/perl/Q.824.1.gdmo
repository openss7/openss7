			BEHAVIOUR
				callingNumberScreeningPackageBhv BEHAVIOUR
					DEFINED AS
						"This object identifies characteristics of the Access Port Profile ISDN object 
						class to be instantiated for screening as defined in Calling Line Supplementary 
						Service I.251.3.

						The attributes included in this object provide an interface with the capability 
						of defining the set of Calling Party Valid Directory Numbers and a Calling Party 
						Default Directory Number for the interface. It also provides a boolean attribute 
						whose value determines whether or not calling party number screening is to be 
						used by call originations.

						The following table shows the possible combinations of the attributes for 
						Calling Party Number Provision Necessary (CPNPN), Screening of Calling Party 
						Number (SCPN), Calling Party Number Discard Control (CPNDC), and Calling Party 
						Default Directory Number (CPDDN).

						CPNPN indicates whether the calling party number must be provided by the calling 
						user for call originations. If CPNPN is Y, then all call originations from the 
						interface must provide a valid calling party number. SCPN indicates whether 
						calling party numbers received from the interface for call originations will be 
						screened against the list of valid DNs for the interface.

						CPNDC indicates whether failed-screening and not-screened calling party numbers 
						are discarded from the calling information. If CPNDC is Y, then calling party 
						numbers that are either not screened or fail screening are discarded. CPDDN is 
						the default DN (or DNs/bearer) that are used for call originations from this 
						interface where the user does not provide a valid calling party number.

						The scenario represented by the first row requires that the user provide valid 
						calling party numbers (CPNPN = Y) for all call set-ups from the interface. 
						User-provided calling party numbers will be screened for validity (SCPN = Y). If 
						the calling party number fails screening, then it is discarded (in fact, the 
						whole call is discarded so CPNDC really has a different meaning in this case). 
						If the calling party number is not provided by the user then the call is 
						cleared. CPDDN is not applicable in this scenario since the DN for the call must 
						come from the user.

						CPNPN SCPN CPNDC CPDDN

						Y Y Y N/A

						N N N Required

						N N Y Required

						N Y N Required

						N Y Y Required

						The second row represents a scenario where the user does not have to include the 
						calling party number (CPNPN = N) for call set-ups from the interface. If the 
						calling party number is provided by the user, it is not screened (SCPN = N) and 
						it is not discarded (CPNDC = N). Any user-provided calling party number is 
						passed as part of the call and may be delivered to the called party if the 
						called party supports two-number delivery. CPDDN is required, and in fact, the 
						default DN is used for every call origination from the interface.

						The third row represents a scenario where the user does not have to include the 
						calling party number (CPNPN = N) for call set-ups from the interface. If the 
						calling party number is provided, it is not screened (SCPN = N) and discarded 
						(CPNDC = Y). CPDDN is required, and in fact, the default DN is used for every 
						call origination from the interface. Any user-provided calling party numbers are 
						ignored (not screened and discarded).

						The fourth row represents a scenario where the user does not have to include the 
						calling party number (CPNPN = N) for call set-ups from the interface. If the 
						calling party number is provided it will be screened for validity (SCPN = Y). If 
						the user-provided calling party number passes screening then that DN is used for 
						the call.

						CPDDN is required, and the default DN is used for call originations from the 
						interface when the user-provided calling party number fails screening, or if the 
						user does not provide a calling party number. Any user-provided calling party 
						numbers that fail screening are also passed as part of the call (CPNDC = N) and 
						may be delivered to the called party if the called party supports two-number 
						delivery.

						The fifth row represents a scenario where the user does not have to include the 
						calling party number (CPNPN = N) for call set-ups from the interface. If the 
						calling party number is provided it will be screened for validity (SCPN = Y). If 
						the user-provided calling party number passes screening then that DN is used for 
						the call. CPDDN is required, and the default DN is used for call originations 
						from the interface when the user-provided calling party number fails screening, 
						or if the user does not provide a calling party number. Any user-provided

						"The Terminal Service Profile (TSP) object class is a class of managed objects

						(SPID). The SPID uniquely identifies the ISDN terminal to the switch and to the 
						supporting Operations System (OS). See Annex A/Q.932 for details.

						The numberOfBChannels attribute limits the B-channel resources that the

						attribute in the associated accessPortProfileIsdn object instance. The default
