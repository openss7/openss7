.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B P_ACTEND_REQ
primitive is used in conjunction with
.BR ap_snd (3)
and the XAP Library environment to provide the user with access to the S-ACTIVITY-END session
service.
.[
x215
.]
The S-ACTIVITY-END session service allows the user to indicate the end of an activity.
.PP
Refer to the table in the manual page description for
.BR ap_snd (3)
for information concerning the effects of sending the
.B P_ACTEND_REQ
primitive and restrictions on its use.
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
To send a
.B P_ACTEND_REQ
primitive, the arguments to
.BR ap_snd (3)
must be set as described below:
.TP \w'\fIaperrno_p\fP\(em'u
.I fd
This argument identifies the APLI/XAP Library instance being used.
.TP
.I sptype
This argument must be set to
.BR AP_P_ACTEND_REQ .
.TP
.I cdata
The following members of
.I cdata
are used for this primitive:
.RS
.RS 4
.PP
.nf
\f(CW\s-1\
long udata_length;     /* length of user-data field       */
long sync_p_sn;        /* serial number (set by provider) */
unsigned long tokens;  /* surrendered tokens              */
\s+1\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Where this primitive is to be sent using a series of calls to
.BR ap_snd (3)
with the
.B AP_MORE
flag set,
.I cdata->udata_length
should be set to the total number of octets of encoded user data that will be
sent with this primitive.  If the total number of octets of encoded user-data
is not known this field may be set to minus one
.RB ( -1 ).
However, in some XAP implementations, setting this field to minus one
.RB ( -1 )
may significantly degrade performance as it requires the implementation to
buffer data until a complete SPDU can be transmitted.
.PP
The total number of octets of encoded user-data that can be sent with this
primitive may be subject to an implementation dependent restriction.  Any such
restriction will be stated in the CSQ for an implementation.
.PP
.I cdata->sync_p_sn
is the serial number assigned to this synchronization point.  This field is set by the provider.
When the XAP Library is being used asynchronously,
.BR ap_snd (3)
may return before the value of the synchronization point serial number is received from the
underlying session provider.  In this case, the service returns the
.RB [ AP_AGAIN ]
error code.  The use must call
.BR ap_snd (3)
repeatedly, with the same
.I cdata->sync_p_sn
argument indicates the value assigned to the synchronization point by the session provider.
.PP
.I cdata->tokens
identifies the token(s) surrendered.  Tokens are identified by OR'ing together one or more of the
following values:
.TP \w'\fBAP_SYNCMINOR_TOK\fP\(em'u
.B AP_DATA_TOK
Data token.
.PD 0
.TP
.B AP_MAJACT_TOK
Synchronize-major/activity token.
.TP
.B AP_SYNCMINOR_TOK
Synchronize-minor token.
.TP
.B AP_RELEASE_TOK
Release token.
.PD
.RE
.TP
.I ubuf
Use of the
.I ubuf
argument is described in the manual page for
.BR ap_snd (3).
.TP
.I flags
The
.I flags
argument is used to control certain aspects of primitive processing as defined
in the manual page for
.BR ap_snd (3).
.RS
.PP
When issuing the
.B P_ACTEND_REQ
primitive via multiple
.BR ap_snd (3)
calls (using the
.B AP_MORE
bit feature), one or more octets of data must be sent on the final
.BR ap_snd (3)
call of the sequence.
.RE
.TP
.I aperrno_p
This must point to a location which will be set to an error code if a failure
occurs.
