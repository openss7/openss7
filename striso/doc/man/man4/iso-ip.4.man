.SH NAME
.B ISO-IP, ISO-UDP
\- ISO CLNS over IP
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ISO-IP
is an implementation of an ISO CLNP
.[
ISO/IEC 8473
.]
Subnetwork Convergence Function Protocol directly over the services of IP
.[
rfc793
.]
or between networks using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP),
.[
rfc768
.]
as defined for experimental use in RFC 1070.
.[
rfc1070
.]
.PP
.B ISO-IP
provides for simple and straightforward encapsulation of CLNS NPDUs in IP
packets or UDP datagrams.
.PP
For providing the ISO CLNS using IP, the IP protocol number
.B 80
has been assigned;
.[
rfc1070
.]
using UDP, the UDP well-known port number
.B 147
has been assigned.
.[
rfc1070
.]
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
For a Connectionless-mode Network Service Provider
.[
x213
.]
using IP and protocol number
.B 80
providing the Network Provider Interface (NPI),
.BR npi (7),
.[
NPI Revision 2.0.0
.]
the
.I STREAMS
pseudo-device driver
.B /dev/iso-ip
can be opened.
.PP
For a Connectionless-mode Network Service Provider
.[
x213
.]
using UDP and port number
.B 147
providing the Network Provider Interface (NPI),
.BR npi (7),
.[
NPI Revision 2.0.0
.]
the
.I STREAMS
pseudo-device driver
.B /dev/iso-udp
can be opened.
.PP
Either Stream can be used directly, or bound and linked underneath the
.BR tp4 (4)
driver to provide Connectionless-mode Network Services for Transport Protocol
Class 4 operation.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
Both forms of the Network Service Provider provide the
.IR STREAMS -based
Service Interface specified in the Network Provider Interface.

.SH ADDRESSES
.PP
Address format is as described in RFC 1069.

.SH NOTICES
.PP
Both RFCs
.[
rfc1069
.]
.[
rfc1070
.]
are described as
.IR Experimental .
The RFC Editor lists both with status
.IR UNKNOWN .
Neither of these RFCs propose a standard. Use of these protocols in the
DARPA Internet is not recommended.
.PP
Nevertheless, the IP version of the protocol provides a good mechanism for
transporting CLNS over LANs; the UDP version, transporting CLNS between LANs
over an Internetwork using existing IP bridges, switches and routers.
.PP
.B ISO-IP
has the advantages that it reuses exsiting IP network management and
internetwork routing; i.e, it does not require the use of X.75 packet data
switches, or ES-IS/IS-IS routing protocols.
