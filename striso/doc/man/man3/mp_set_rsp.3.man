.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function is used to reply to a previously invoked confirmed Set operation.  This function can
only be called in synchronous mode.
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I session
The management session against which this operation is performed.
This must be a private object previously returned from
.BR mp_bind (3).
.TP
.I context
The management context to be used for this operation.
This argument must be a private object or the contant
.RB ( MP_DEFAULT_CONTEXT ).
.TP
.I response
The information supplied in response to the Set confirmed operation.  For a CMIS set operation, the
response is one of the following:
.RS
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
When a set is performed on no objects, this is indicated by the constant
.RB ( MP_ABSENT_OBJECT )
as the response.
.IP \(bu
When a set is performed on a single object, this is indicated by one instance of the OM class
.RB { MP_C_CMIS_SET_RESULT }
as the response.
.IP \(bu
When a set is performed on multiple objects, this is indicated by one or more
.BR mp_set_rsp ()
calls, one for each selected object, followed by a final \*(lqempty\*(rq
.BR mp_set_rsp ().
Each
.BR mp_set_rsp ()
call includes a response which contains an instance of the OM class
.RB { MP_C_CMIS_LINKED_REPLY_ARGUMENT }.
Each instance contains exactly one of the following OM attributes:
.RS
.TP
.RB [ MP_SET_RESULT ],
.PD 0
.TP
.RB [ MP_SET_LIST_ERROR ],
.TP
.RB [ MP_PROCESSING_FAILURE ].
.PD
.PP
The final \*(lqempty\*(rq
.BR mp_set_rsp ()
call includes a response that contains only the constant
.RB ( MP_ABSENT_OBJECT ).
.RE
.IP \(bu
An instance of the OM class
.RB { MP_C_SERVICE_ERROR }
or
.RB { MP_C_SERVICE_REJECT }
indicates the failure of the operation.
.RS
.PP
The following
.RB { MP_C_SERVICE_ERRORS }
including the problem cause and its associated parameter may be returned:
.TP
.RB [ MP_E_ACCESS_DENIED ],
