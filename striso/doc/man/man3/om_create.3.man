.IR class "\0\fBClass\fP(Object Identifier)
Specifies the class of the object to be created.  The specified class shall be
concrete and shall be amoung those that are permissible to be created for its
associated package.
.TP
.IR initialize "\0\fBInitialize\fP(Boolean)
Specifies whether the create object is to be initialized as specified in the
definition of its class.  If this argument is true, the object is made to
comprise the attribute values specified as initial values in the tabular
definitions of the object's class and its superclasses.  If this argument is
false, the object is made to comprise the Class attribute alone.

By subsequently adding new values to the object and replacing and removing
existing values, the client can create all conceivable instances of the

The workspace in which to the object is to be created.  The specified class
shall be in a package associated with this workspace.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.BR om_create ()
function creates a new private object that is an instance of a particular
class.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon successful completion, the zero value of
.RB [ OM_SUCCESS ]
is returned. Otherwise, a non-zero diagnostic error value is returned.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR om_create ()
fails, it returns a non-zero error code, as follows:
.TP
.RB [ OM_FUNCTION_DECLINED ]
The function does not apply to the object to which it is addressed.
.TP
.RB [ OM_FUNCTION_INTERRUPTED ]
The function was aborted by an external force (for example, a keystroke,
designated for this purpose, at a user interface).
.TP
.RB [ OM_MEMORY_INSUFFICIENT ]
The service cannot allocate the main memory it needs to complete the function.
.TP
.RB [ OM_NETWORK_ERROR ]
The service could not successfully employ the network upon which its
implementation depends.
.TP
.RB [ OM_NO_SUCH_CLASS ]
A purported class identifier is undefined.
.TP
.RB [ OM_NO_SUCH_WORKSPACE ]
A purported workspace is nonexistent.
.TP
.RB [ OM_NOT_CONCRETE ]
A class is abstract, not concrete.
.TP
.RB [ OM_PERMANENT_ERROR ]
The service encountered a permanent difficulty other than those denoted by
other return codes.
.TP
.RB [ OM_POINTER_INVALID ]
In the C inteface, an invalid pointer was supplied as a function argument or as
the receptacle for a function result.
.TP
.RB [ OM_SYSTEM_ERROR ]
The service could not successfully employ the operating system upon which its
implementation depends.
.TP
.RB [ OM_TEMPORARY_ERROR ]
The service encountered a temporary difficulty other than those denoted by
other return codes.
.PP
Other arguments passed to or returned by the function are unaffected.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR om_create ()
is compatible with
.IR "Solstice OSI 8.0 "  to " 9.0
and implementations based on
XOM,
.[

Note that many add-on OSI packages for popular UNIX SVR 4.2 based releases
provided the XOM interface and the associated set of X/Open, IEEE and ISO
standard interfaces.
.IP \(em
The function is source compatible only.  Binary compatibility was not
attempted.
