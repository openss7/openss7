.B #include <xftam.h>
.HP
.B FT_return_code ft_close(
.br
.BI "OM_private_object " session );
.\"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function deletes an XFTAM \fIinstance\fP established by \fBft_open\fP(3)
and releases associated resources.  No XFTAM function may references the
specified session and its associated workspace once it has been closed.
.PP
Any asynchronous operations that are outstanding when a session is closed are
abandoned in the manner defined by the \fBft_abandon\fP(3) function.  The
warnings stated there with regard to the state of the files and file-stores
involved in a file transfer apply in this case too.  Underlying XFTAM
associations are destroyed in the manner described by either the
\fBft_abort\fP(3) or \fBft_disconnect\fP(3) functions.
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.BI session " (Private Object (Session))
This parameter is a handle for a private object of class \fBSession\fP that
identifies the particular XFTAM instance that is to perform the required XFTAM
operation.  The session identifies the resources associated with the instance,
including the XOP \fIworkspace\fP that contains all private objects passed to
or returned from this XFTAM function call.

Only source compatibility is attempted.  Binary compatibility will fail due to
the lack of published and standard symbolic constants.  Any binary
compatibility experienced is a bug and will be removed in the next release.
