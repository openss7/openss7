.SH NAME

\- get the host name corresponding to an NSAP
.\"

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <tiuser.h>
.br
.B #include <osi.h>
.HP
.BI "int getnamebynsap(int " hostname_maxlen ", char *" hostname ", char *" nsap ");
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I hostname_maxlen
the maximum length of the host name buffer pointed to by
.IR hostname .
.TP
.I hostname
a pointer to a buffer into which to receive the (null terminate) hostname string.
.TP
.I nsap
a pointer to a buffer containing the NSAP to convert.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B libosi
user library provides a mechanism for setting local and remote addresses using
the host name of the machine.  This avoids the need for users of applications
to deal with NSAPs and TSAPs.  The library usese the file
.B /etc/net/oclt/host
for host name to NSAP conversion, and the fie
.B /etc/net/oclt/services
for hostname to TSEL conversion.
.PP
.BR getnamebynsap ()
uses the NSAP address pointed to by the
.I nsap
argument to retrieve the host name into the buffer located at
.I hostname
of maximum length
.IR hostname_maxlen .
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When successful,
.BR getnamebynsap ()
returns the positive length of the returned host name in octets;
when unsuccessful, minus one
.RB ( -1 ).
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When unsuccessful,
.BR getnamebynsap ()
returns minus one,
.RB ( -1 )
and sets
.IR errno (3)
to an appropriate error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
The following example demonstrates placing the local NSAP in a netbuf and using
it to get the host name of the local host:

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR getnamebynsap ()
is compatible with
.I SunLink OSI
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
This function is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function that is implemented by
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
to assist with porting
.I SunLink OSI
applications programs to
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" .
.IP ""
.BR getnamebynsap ()
will not be used by portable programs.
.IP \(em
Although not POSIX, the Sun TI-RPC function
.BR netdir_getbyaddr (3)
is probably more portable.
.IP ""
.BR getnamebynsap ()
will not be used by portable programs.
