.SH NAME

\- get the NSAP that corresponds to a host name
.\"

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <tiuser.h>
.br
.B #include <osi.h>
.HP
.BI "int getnsapbynam(int " nsap_maxlen ", char *" hostname ", char *" nsap ");
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I nsap_maxlen
the maximum length of the buffer pointed to by
.IR nsap .
.TP
.I hostname
the (null terminated) host name to translate to an NSAP.
.TP
.I nsap
a pointer to a buffer of maximum length
.I nsap_maxlen
that is to receive the NSAP corresponding to
.IR hostname .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B libosi
user library provides a mechanism for setting local and remote addresses using
the host name of the machine.  This avoids the need for users of applications
to deal with NSAPs and TSAPs.  The library usese the file
.B /etc/net/oclt/host
for host name to NSAP conversion, and the fie
.B /etc/net/oclt/services
for hostname to TSEL conversion.
.PP
.B getnsapbyname ()
translates a host name in the string pointed to by the
.I hostname
 argument into an NSAP that is transferred into the buffer pointed to by the
.I nsap
argument of maximum length
.IR nsap_maxlen .
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When successful,
.BR getnsapbyname ()
returns the positive length of the NSAP in octets;
when unsuccessful, minus one
.RB ( -1 ).
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When unsuccessful,
.BR getnsapbyname ()
returns minus one,
.RB ( -1 )
and sets
.IR errno (3)
to an appropriate error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
The following example demonstrates placing the NSAP in a netbuf and using it
to connect a
.BR /dev/otpi
Stream:

.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR getnsapbyname ()
is compatible with
.I SunLink OSI
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
This function is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function that is implemented by
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
to assist with porting
.I SunLink OSI
applications programs to
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" .
.IP ""
.BR getnsapbyname ()
will not be used by portable programs.
.IP \(em
Although not POSIX, the Sun TI-RPC function
.BR netdir_getbyname (3)
with only a host name
is probably more portable.
.IP ""
.BR getnsapbyname ()
will not be used by portable programs.
.PP
See
.BR libosi (3),
for additional compatibility information.
