5.4.2 Alpha Releases
--------------------

"Alpha" release are releases that have received little to no testing,
or that have been tested and contains known bugs or defects that make
the package unsuitable even for testing.  The purpose for an "alpha"
release are the same as for the pre-alpha release, with the additional
purpose that it is an earily release of partially functional code that
has problems that an external developer might be willing to fix
themselves and contribute back to the project.

"Alpha" release packages ship containing warnings that executing the
code can crash machines and might possibly do damage to systems upon
which it is executed.
