.SH NAME

\- \fISTREAMS\fR bi-directional pipe device
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The software pipes obtained by the system call
.BR pipe (2)
are not necessarily bidirectional.
.[
xbd5
.]
.[
susv2
.]
.[
susv3
.]
The
.B spx
.I STREAMS
pseudo-device driver provide a mechanism for obtaining
.IR STREAMS -based
pipes that are bidirectional in nature.
.PP
The
.B spx
pseudo-device driver is a regular
.I STREAMS
device driver.
.PP
Because the
.BR open (2)
system call only returns one file descriptor, the following procedure is used
to create two file descriptors with a connected
.IR STREAMS -based
pipe between them:
.IP (1) \w'(000)'u
Open
.B /dev/spx
an obtain a first file descriptor.  At this point there is only half of the
pipe available.
This step obtains
.IR fd [0].
.IP (2)
Open
.B /dev/spx
again to obtain a second file descriptor.  At this point there are two
unconnected stream heads.
This step obtains
.IR fd [2].
.IP (2)
Call
.BR ioctl (2)
with the
.B I_FDINSERT
command (see
.BR streamio (7))
to associate
.IR fd [0]
with
.IR fd [1].
This can either be accomplished by performing an
.B I_FDINSERT
with
.IR fd [1]
on the stream returned as
.IR fd [0];
or, with
.IR fd [0]
on
.IR fd [1].
The data part of the
.B I_FDINSERT
command is ignored, and the control part of the
.B I_FDINSERT
command contains only the file descriptor translated to a queue pointer.
This step connects
.IR fd [0]
to
.IR fd [1]
for a fully connected,
.IR STREAMS -based,
bi-directional pipe.
.\"
.SS Characteristics
.PP
Following are some characteristics of
.IR STREAMS -based
pips that cause their behaviour to differ from that of
regular
.I STREAMS
character special device files:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
.IR STREAMS -based
pipes cannot be clone opened.
But see
.BR connld (4).
.IP \(bu
.IR STREAMS -based
pipes have both ends open for both read and write.
.IP \(bu
When a
.IR STREAMS -based
pipe is hung up, or the other end of the
.IR STREAMS -based
pipe is closed, write and write-like operations return
.RB [ EPIPE ]
and generate a
.RI { SIGPIPE }
signal to the caller, instead of simply returning
.RB [ ENXIO ]
as is the case for regular
.I STREAMS
devices.
This is true for
.BR write (2),
.BR writev (2),
.BR putmsg (2),
.BR putpmsg (2),
and
.BR streamio (7)
input-output controls that write messages to the
.IR Stream ,
such as
.BR I_FDINSERT (7).
.IP \(bu
By default, when an asynchronous write error occurs, and a write or write-like operation is
performed,
.IR STREAMS -based
pipes will generate
.RI { SIGPIPE }
to the caller in addition to returning the error from the asynchronous write error message.  This
behavior can be suppressed by clearing the
.B SNDPIPE
option using the
.BR I_SWROPT (7)
input-output control.  This is the reverse of the default behavior for regular
.I STREAMS
character special files.
.IP \(bu
By default, attempting to write a zero-length data message to a
.BR STREAMS -based
pipe with
.BR write (2),
.BR writev (2),
.BR putmsg (2),
or
.BR putpmsg (2),
will succeed, return zero, but no message will be generated.  Generation of the message can be
enabled by setting the
.B SNDZERO
option using the
.BR I_SWROPT (7)
input-output control.  This is the reverse of the default behaviour for regular
.I STREAMS
character special files.
.IP \(bu
.IR STREAMS -based
pipes break large writes down into independent data messages of 4096 bytes or less.  Writes of less
than or equal to 4096 bytes are guaranteed atomic.  Writes of greater than 4096 byes are not
guaranteed atomic.  This is default behaviour of all
.I STREAMS
character special files, unless altered by the driver.
.IP \(bu
An end of a
.IR STREAMS -based
pipes that has no modules pushed, even when full and blocked on write, will not block on close as
described under
.BR I_SETCLTIME (7),
because there is no driver write queue.
.IP \(bu
.BR I_LIST (7)
will not report a count for a driver
on either end of a
.IR STREAMS -based
pipe
.RI ( STREAMS -based
pipes have no driver).
.IP \(bu
.BR I_LINK (7),
.BR I_PLINK (7),
.BR I_UNLINK (7),
and
.BR I_PUNLINK (7),
will always fail with error
.RB [ EINVAL ]
on a
.IR STREAMS -based
pipe.
.IP \(bu
.BR I_SENDFD (7)
and
.BR I_RECVFD (7)
will operate on a
.IR STREAMS -based
pipe (whereas they fail on a regular
.I STREAMS
character special file).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The characteristics of bi-directional
.IR STREAMS -based
pipes,
by comparison to
SVR 3
.[
svr3
.]
style pipes is as follows:
.IP \(bu 2
.IR STREAMS -based
pipes
are bi-directional.  Both sides are opened for both read and write.  Data
written to one end of the pipe can be read by the other.  Both ends of the
pipe can have data written and read.
.IP \(bu 2
.IR STREAMS -based
pipes
can have modules pushed and popped from either side of the pipe.  However, before pushing a
.I STREAMS
module on either side of the
.IR STREAMS -based
pipe, the
.BR pipemod (4)
module should be pushed on one end of the
.IR STREAMS -based
pipe to reverse the sense of
.BR M_FLUSH (9)
bits for proper flushing of the pipe.
.IP \(bu 2
.IR STREAMS -based
pipes
can have the
.BR connld (4)
module can be pushed onto one end of the pipe.
.IP \(bu 2
.IR STREAMS -based
pipes
have controllable flow control and minimum and maximum packet size characteristics.
.IP \(bu 2
.IR STREAMS -based
pipes
permit the use of the
.BR getmsg (2),
.BR getpmsg (2s),
.BR putmsg (2)
and
.BR putpmsg (2s)
system calls on the pipe ends.
.IP \(bu 2
.IR STREAMS -based
pipes
permit the use of
.I STREAMS
IO controls on either pipe end.  See
.BR streamio (7).
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
Although an
.BR stat (2)
on the
.B /dev/spx
device node will show the node as being a character special device with a
device number corresponding to the
.B spx
driver, an
.BR fstat (2)
on the file descriptor resulting from an
.BR open (2)
call on
.B /dev/spx
will indicate that the file is a fifo.  This is rather normal
.IR UNIX \(rg
behaviour.
.PP
Depending on
.IR Linux \(rg
kernel configuration parameters, it might not be necessary to go to this
extent to create a
.IR STREAMS -based
bidirectional pipe.  When kernel
configuration parameter
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_PIPES_REPLACE
is set, then the SVR 3
.[
svr3
.]
pipe approach used by
.IR Linux \(rg
will be replaced with a bi-directional
.IR STREAMS -based
pipe.  Then, a simple
call to
.BR pipe (2)
will return a bidirectional pipe and it is not necessary to open the
.B spx
driver to obtain one.
.PP
When first opened, a
.B spx
device behaves similar to an Echo Device,
.BR echo (4).
.PP
Under
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
it is possible to make all
.B Linux
system pipes
.IR STREAMS -based.
This must be done when the package is configured and will be effected when the
.I STREAMS
pipe kernel module is loaded.  Once the kernel module is loaded all pipes subsequently opened with
the
.BR pipe (2)
system call will be
.IR STREAMS -based.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.B spx
is not implemented as a normal
.I STREAMS
driver: it is implemented as a shadow special device node under
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
.[
lfs
.]
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
shadow special devices nodes call
.BR pipe_open ()
from
.BR cdev_open ()
instead of
.BR spec_open ()
permitting the
.B pipe
device to intercept and redirect the open call to the appropriate device.
This is consistent with the descriptions for the internal
.BR pipe_open ()
under
.IR "SVR 4" .

    fdi.filedes = fds[0];
    fdi.offset = 0;
    fdi.flags = RS_NORM;
    if (ioctl(fds[0], I_FDINSERT, &fdi) < 0) {
        close(fds[0]);
