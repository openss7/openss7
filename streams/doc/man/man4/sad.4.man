.PP
.I fd

.BR open (2)
system call on one of the following devices:
.TP
.RI \*(lq /dev/sad/admin \*(rq
This device is only accessible by privileged users.
.TP
.RI \*(lq /dev/sad/user \*(rq
This device is accessible by all users.

using the
.BR ioctl (2)
system call as follows:

device.
.TP
.I cmd
is the ioctl command and can be one of the following:
.sp
.TS

Historically, the

driver has not used user credentials on a IO control by IO control basis, but
permits access to the privileged
.B SAD_SAP
command on the basis of file access controls.  This means that a user program
can open the
.RI \*(lq /dev/sad/admin \*(rq
device while suid root and then downgrade its credentials for security, but
still have the ability to modify the autopush list for
.IR STREAMS (4)
devices.
