.SH NAME
.B RD
\- return the read queue of a \fISTREAMS\fR queue pair
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "queue_t *RD(" q );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
a pointer to either the read queue or write queue of the queue pair.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR RD ()
returns the read queue associated with the queue pair indicated by the queue
pointer
.IR q ,
regardless of whether
.I q
points to the read queue or the write queue of the queue pair.
.PP
.BR RD ()
is typically and often used to find the read queue from a pointer to one of
the queues in a queue pair.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR RD ()
returns a pointer to the read queue of the queue pair referenced by
.IR q .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR RD ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR RD ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
call-outs, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.PP
.BR RD ()
is MP-safe; however,
the caller is responsible for the validity of the reference
.IR q .
References to
.I q
from a procedure, call-out or callback predicated on the queue pair to which
.I q
belongs
are guaranteed valid.
The caller must guarantee validity from call-outs, callbacks, soft interrupts
and interrupt service routines not predicated on the queue pair to which
.I q
belongs.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
If
.I q
is invalid, the result is undefined.
.PP
If
.I q
is
.BR NULL ,
a kernel panic may occur.
.PP
If
.I q
points to a write queue,
.I q
will be returned.

.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR RD ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR RD ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em 3
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg,
.[
suxspg
.]
.IR UnixWare \(rg,
.[
uw7spg
.]
.IR LiS ,
.[
lis
.]
permit both a read or write queue pointer to be passed
as the
.I q
argument to
.BR RD ().
If a read queue pointer is passed to
.BR RD (),
then the passed in read queue pointer is returned.
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.IR AIX \(rg,
.[
aixspg
.]
.IR OSF/1 \(rg,
.[
osfspg
.]
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.[
solspg
.]
.IR UXP/V \(rg,
.[
uxpspg
.]
permit only a write queue to be passed as the
.I q
argument to
.BR RD ().
Passing a read queue to
.BR RD ()
on these implementations can cause a kernel panic.
On these systems
.BR RD ()
is often defined as:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-2\
#define RD(__q) ((__q)-1)
\s+2\fP
.fi
.IP \(em
.BR RD ()
is implemented on
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
as both an
.B extern inline
function as well as a macro.
It accepts either read or write queue pointer and returns the passed in read
queue pointer when called with a read queue.
.I RD(q) == RD(RD(q))
and
.I RD(WR(q)) == (WR(q) - 1)
are invariantly true.
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-2\
#undef RD
#define RD(__q) ((__q)-1)
\s+2\fP
.fi
.sp
is a valid alternative implementation if the
.I STREAMS
programmer wishes the more restrictive
.BR RD ()
behaviour.
.IP \(em
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules should not
call
.BR RD ()
with a queue other than the write queue;
nor
rely upon
.BR RD ()
being defined as a macro or a function.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.
