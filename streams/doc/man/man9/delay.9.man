.PD
.HP
void \fBdelay\fP(unsigned long \fIticks\fP)
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I ticks
the number of clock ticks to delay.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR DDI/DKI .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR delay ()
schedules the calling process for at least the number of system clock ticks specified by the
.I ticks
argument.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR delay ()
is only usable from user (blockable) context.  This makes it not very useful for
.I STREAMS
modules and drivers.  See
.BR SV_WAIT (9)
or
.BR qwait (9)
for other approaches.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR delay ()
returns void.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR delay ()
fails silently.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR delay ()
can be called from user context which includes
.IR qi_qopen (9)
and
.IR qi_qclose (9)
procedures.
If called from
.I STREAMS
context, it will block the softirq kernel daemon thread and have hazardous effects on system
performance.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR delay ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR delay ()
will not be interrupted by a signal.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR delay ()
is implemented using the
.B Linux
kernel function
.BR schedule_timeout (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR udelay (9),
.BR drv_usecwait (9),
.BR SV_WAIT (9),
.BR qwait (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR delay ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR delay ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI"
.[
usldk
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR delay ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for the purpose of porting
.IR "SVR 4.2"
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR "SVR 4.2"
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR delay ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR delay ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
