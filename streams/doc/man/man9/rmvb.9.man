.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I mp
the message from which to remove the message block.
.TP

and returns the pointer to the (new) first message block in the message.
.PP
.BR rmvb ()
removes the message block
.I bp
from the message
.IR mp ,
but does not free the message block
.IR bp .
.IR bp 's
.I b_cont
pointer is set to
.BR NULL .
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR rmvb ()
returns a pointer to the modified message.
The modified message may be
.BR NULL .
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR rmvb ()
returns
.BR "(mblk_t *)(-1)" .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR rmvb ()
fails it returns
.BR "(mblk_t *)(-1)" .
.BR rmvb ()
only fails if
.I bp
was not in the message.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR rmvb ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"

with the following exceptions:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
When
.IR mp " and " bp
are
.BR NULL ,
.BR rmvb ()
correctly returns
.BI "(mblk_t *)(" -1 )\fR.
Under LiS
.BR rmvb ()
will return
.B NULL
in the same situation.  This is an LiS bug.
.PP
Symbol
.BR lis_rmvb ()
is provided for compatibility with LiS.  See
.BR liscompat (9).
.BR lis_rmvb ()
calls
