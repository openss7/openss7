The device number to convert to an external extended minor device number.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR emajor (9),
.BR eminor (9)
and
.BR mkdev (9)
are a group of architectural specific macros intended to replace the
architectural independent
.I SVR 3
.[

.]
functions
.BR major (9),
.BR minor (9)
and
.BR makedev (9).
.PP
.BR eminor ()
is an architectural specific macro that obtains the external (real) extended
minor device number associated with device
.IR dev .

.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR eminor ()
returns the external (real) extended minor device number associated with device
.IR dev .

.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR eminor ()
is always successful.

.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR eminor ()

.SH MP-STREAMS

.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR eminor ()
is a
.IR SCO \(rg-specific
function:
.BR _UW7_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.

.SH BUGS

.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR eminor ()
is compatible with
.IR SCO \(rg
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR eminor ()
is an
.B extern inline
function call.
.IR SCO \(rg
implements
.BR eminor ()
as a system dependent macro.
.IP \(em
.IR SCO \(rg
includes
.B sys/sysmacros.h
instead of
.BR sys/ddi.h .
.IP \(em
.BR eminor ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR SCO \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR SCO \(rg
drivers from
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR SCO \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR eminor ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR SCO \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.  Any and all functionality provided by
.BR eminor ()
in support of
.RB non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR STREAMS (9)
