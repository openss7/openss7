.SH NAME
.B RW_DEALLOC
\- deallocate a read/write lock
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #define _SVR4_SOURCE
.br
.B #include <sys/ksynch.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/ddi.h>
.HP
.BI "void RW_DEALLOC(rwlock_t *" lockp );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I lockp
A pointer to the read/write lock to be deallocated.  The read/write lock must
have previously been allocated with
.BR RW_ALLOC (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR RW_ALLOC (9),
.BR RW_DEALLOC (),
.BR RW_RDLOCK (9),
.BR RW_WRLOCK (9),
.BR RW_TRYRDLOCK (9),
.BR RW_TRYWRLOCK (9)
and
.BR RW_UNLOCK (9)
are a set of primitive functions for allocating, deallocating, read locking,
write locking, read lock attempt, write lock attempt and unlocking a
read/write lock of type
.BR rwlock_t .
.PP
.BR RW_DEALLOC ()
deallocates a read/write lock previously dynamically allocated with
.BR RW_ALLOC (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR RW_DEALLOC ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR RW_DEALLOC ()
is always successful.  Passing an invalid
.I lockp
argument, or a pointer to a
.B rwlock_t
structure that was not previously allocated with
.BR RW_ALLOC (9),
or a pointer to a
.B rwlock_t
that is in the read or write locked state,
will have indeterminate results.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR RW_DEALLOC ()
can be called from any context.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR RW_DEALLOC ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR RW_DEALLOC ()
is a
.IR "SVR 4.2" -specific
function:
.B _SVR4_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SVR4
defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR RW_DEALLOC ()
deallocates the
.B rwlock_t
structure using
.BR kmem_free (9).
.\"
.\"

.BR STREAMS (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR RW_DEALLOC ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR RW_DEALLOC ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI"
.[
usldk
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR RW_DEALLOC ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for the purpose of porting
.IR "SVR 4.2"
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR "SVR 4.2"
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR RW_DEALLOC ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR "SVR 4.2"
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR RW_DEALLOC ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.

See
.BR STREAMS (9)
