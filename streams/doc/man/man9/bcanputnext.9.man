.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
It is the responsibility of a
.I STREAMS
module passing a normal priority,
message to
the
next
queue, to check for flow control using
.BR bcanputnext ()
before passing the mssage with
.BR putnext (9).
.PP
.BR bcanputnext ()
checks whether the
Stream
is flow controlled starting at
.IR q->q_next ,
and for the specified
.IR band .
.BR bcanputnext ()
looks for the first queue with a
.IR qi_srvp (9)
service procedure, or no next queue (i.e. the
.I q_next
pointer is
.BR NULL ).
.PP
If the first queue has the
.B QFULL
.RI ( band " == 0)
or
.B QB_FULL
.RI ( band " >= 1)
flag clear indicating that it is not full for the specified
.IR band ,
or a
.BR qband (9)
structure does not yet exist for the specified band
.RI ( band " >= 1),
then
.BR bcanputnext ()
will return
.I true
.RB ( 1 ).
.PP
If the first queue has the
.B QFULL
.RI ( band " == 0)
or
.B QB_FULL
.RI ( band " >= 1)
flag set indicating that it is full for the specified
.IR band ,
and a
.BR qband (9)
structure exists for the specified band
.RI ( band " >= 1),
then
.BR bcanputnext ()
will return false (0).
.PP
When
.BR bcanputnext ()
returns false (0), it also sets the
.B QWANTW
.RI ( band " == 0)
or
.B QB_WANTW
.RI ( band " >= 1)
flag for the specified
.IR band ,
indicating that the
.I STREAMS
scheduler should back-enable
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedures backward up the queues when the flow controlled
.I band
is no longer flow controlled (falls to its low water mark).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
It is the responsibility of a
.I STREAMS
driver or module passing a banded (normal priority) data message
.RB ( M_PROTO "(9), " M_DATA (9))
to a subsequent queue to check for flow control using
.BR bcanputnext ()
for the band associated with the message before passing the message to the queue with
.BR putnext (9).
A
.I STREAMS
module is only required to check for flow control if it has a
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure for the specified queue: otherwise, it was the responsibility of a previous
.I STREAMS
module,
Stream head
or
Stream end
to check flow control.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR bcanputnext ()
will return
.I false
.RB ( 0 )
when the specified
.I STREAMS
message queue is flow controlled
for the specified band,
and returns
.I true
.RB ( 1 )
when the specified
.I STREAMS
message queue is not flow controlled
for the specified band, or the specified band has not yet been written to.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR bcanputnext ()
always succeeds for a valid
.IR q .
If
.I q
is invalid, the result is undefined.
It is invalid to pass
.BR bcanputnext ()
a
.I q
where
.I q->q_next
is
.BR NULL .
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR bcanputnext ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures, callouts, callbacks, soft
interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR bcanputnext ()
is MP-safe when called from any context.  However, the caller is responsible for the validity of the
passed in queue pointer,
.IR q ,
across the call.
.PP
The validity of either queue in the pair, and either
.I q_next
pointer for a queue in the pair, for the queue pointer passed to a module procedure, callout
or synchronous callback functions, is guaranteed by
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" .
Any queue pointer in the pair passed as an argument to an asynchronous callback function
is also valid, providing the driver or module observes the rules for cancellation of asynchronous
callbacks on close.
.PP
When wishing to test flow control on
the queue beyond a driver's upper multiplex read queue
from an interrupt service routine, where there is no
.IR qi_srvp (9)
service procedure defined for the read queue, a more portable approach is to call
.BR put (9)
instead and test flow control from within the read queue's
.IR qi_putp (9)
put procedure.
.PP
It is possible, due to race conditions in a
multiprocessor (MP) system, that
.BR bcanputnext ()
can be called for a queue and return
.I true
.RB ( 1 )
and yet the
Stream
becomes flow controlled before a
call to
.BR putnext (9).
The caller to
.BR putnext (9)
is then in violation of flow-control rules; however, the extent of this violation is bounded.
.PP
It is also possible, that
.BR bcanputnext ()
can be called for a queue and return
.I false
.RB ( 0 ),
and a queue utility retrieving a message from the full queue causes flow control to subside and the
service procedure of the caller to become back-enabled before the call to
.BR putq (9)
(in the case
.BR bcanputnext ()
is called from a
.IR qi_putp (9)
put procedure),
or
.BR putbq (9)
(in the case
.BR bcanputnext ()
is called from a
.IR qi_srvp (9)
service procedure).
In the case that the service procedure runs before
.BR putq (9),
placing the message on the queue will invoke the service procedure again, when necessary.
In the case that the queue was enabled before
.BR putbq (9),
execution of the service procedure will occur after the current service procedure exits.
.PP
Although
.BI bcanput( q->q_next ", " band )
is functionally equivalent to
.BI bcanputnext( q ", " band ),
for the
.BR bcanput (9)
form, the dereference of the
.I q->q_next
pointer is not protected on some implementations of
.I STREAMS
for MP architectures: on which
.I q_next
may change as a result of a
concurrent reconfiguration of the
Stream
(e.g. an
.BR I_PUSH " or " I_POP
.BR streamio (7)
operation).
For MP operation,
portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will always call
.BR bcanputnext ()
instead of
.BI bcanput( q->q_next ", " band ).
.PP
For maximum portability and compatibility,
.BI bcanputnext( q ", " band )
under
.B "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
is always MP-safe from any context and for any
.I q
whose validity the caller can guarantee across the call.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
It is the responsibility of a
.I STREAMS
driver or module passing a normal priority,
message to an adjacent queue to check for flow control using
.BR bcanputnext ()
before passing a message to the queue with
.BR putnext (9) .
.PP
.BR canputnext (9)
and
.BR bcanputnext ()
should always be used instead of
.BI canput( q->q_next )
and
.BI bcanput( q->q_next )
on multiprocessor (MP) implementations.
.PP
.BR canputnext (9)
and
.BR bcanputnext ()
will always be used instead of
.BI canput( q->q_next )
or
.BI bcanput( q->q_next )
by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules
on multiprocessor (MP) systems.
.PP
.BR canput (9)
and
.BR canputnext (9)
are the equivalent of
.BR bcanput ()
and
.BR bcanputnext (9)
with a zero
.IR band :
and are implemented as such.
.PP
Note that there is some conflict in the documentation as to what happens when
.BR bcanputnext ()
hits the queue at end of the Stream
.RI ( q->q_next
is
.BR NULL )
and the queue has no service procedure.  Some implementations, notably
.IR UnixWare \(rg,
.[
uw7doc
.]
say
.BR bcanputnext ()
always returns
.IR true
.RB ( 1 )
in this situation.
The
.IR "SVR 4 SPG"
.[
svr4spg
.]
stays that
.BR bcanputnext ()
searches for the a queue with a service procedure or which has no forward queue and then peforms the
actions.  This also consistent with
.IR Solaris \(rg
.[
solspg
.]
behaviour.
The
.IR "SVR 4 SPG" ,
.[
svr4spg
.]
however, also says that if a
.IR qi_putp (9)
put procedure places a message onto its own queue with
.BR putq (9),
that it requires a
.IR qi_srvp (9)
service procedure.
One would not then expect a queue without a service procedure to have anything but an empty message
queue, and in that case,
.BR bcanputnext ()
can be expected to always return
.I true
.RB ( 1 )
for it.
.PP
.B "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
performs the actions on the queue at the end of the Stream when it is reached regardless of whether
it has a
.IR qi_srvp (9)
service procedure or not.  This is consistent with the description in the
.IR "SVR 4 SPG"
.[
svr4spg
.]
as well as
.IR Solaris \(rg
behaviour.
If such a queue's
.IR qi_putp (9)
put procedure never places message on the queue with
.BR putq (9),
there will be no difference in the values returned to
.BR bcanputnext ();
if the put procedure does place messages with
.BR putq (9),
without a service procedure,
.BR bcanputnext ()
will act as expected by the description in the
.IR "SVR 4 SPG" .

.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.B "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
.[
@PACKAGE_TITLE@
.]
provides the additional feature that
.I band
can be specified as
.BR ANYBAND .
When
.I band
is
.BR ANYBAND ,
.BR bcanputnext ()
checks whether any band (other than band zero), is not flow controlled.  If a
band exists that is not flow controlled,
.BR bcanputnext ()
with
.B ANYBAND
returns one (1).
If all existing bands are flow controlled,
.BR bacnputnext ()
returns zero (0).
.PP
.BR bcanputnext ()
uses atomic bit operations and does not require locking of the queue
structure.  Therefore,
.BR bcanput ()
can be called for a
.I q
that is frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).

.PP
The transmit ISR operates much like a service procedure, it removes
messages from the write queue at
.BR "Line 13" ,
writes data out to the device transmit FIFO at
.BR "Line 16" ,
and either places messages with more data back on the queue at
.BR "Line 20" ,
or frees empty messages at
.BR "Line 25" ,
.PP
For
.BR rmvq (9)
at
.BR "Line 13"
to properly back-enable the queue,
.BR canputnext (9)
or
.BR bcanputnext (9)
must set the
.BR QWANTW
flag on this queue when
.BR QFULL
is set, regardless of whether it has a service procedure or not.
Of course, it is possible to provide a dummy service procedure as follows:
.PP
.nf
\fC\s-2\
 1  int
 2  example_wsrv(queue_t *q)
 3  {
 4      return (0);

All versions of
.I LiS
contain the bug that they keep track of message queue counts,
.IR q_count ,
.IR qb_count ,
in terms of the sum of the absolute sizes of the data buffers referenced by message blocks,
.RB ( "db_lim - db_base" ),
and not the sizes of the message blocks themselves,
.RB ( "b_wptr - b_rptr" ),
which does not conform to
.IR "SVR 4.2 STREAMS" .
