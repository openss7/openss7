.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B M_IOCNAK
message is generated and sent from the driver or module processing an
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
message.
The
.B M_IOCNAK
message signals the negative acknowledgement (failure) of the
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
message and completion of the
.BR ioctl (2s)
system call.
.PP
The message format is one
.B M_IOCNAK
block (containing an
.BR iocblk (9)
structure, see
.BR M_IOCTL (9))
followed by zero or more
.BR M_DATA (9)
blocks.  The
.BR iocblk (9)
structure may contain a value in
.I ioc_error
to be returned to the user process in
.BR errno (3).
Unlike
.BR M_IOCACK (9),
no user data or return value can be sent with this message.  If any
.BR M_DATA (9)
blocks follow the
.B M_IOCNAK
block, the
Stream head
will ignore and free them.
When the
Stream head
receives an
.BR M_IOCNAK ,
the outstanding
.BR ioctl (2s)
request, if any, will fail.
.PP
The format and use of this message type is described further under
.BR M_IOCTL (9).
.\"
.B M_IOCNAK
messages cannot be generated directly by a user level process.
.B M_IOCNAK
messages arriving at a non-multiplexing driver can be discarded (ignored and freed).
.B M_IOCNAK
message can be generated by drivers and modules responding to an
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
message.
.B M_IOCNAK
messages are consumed by the
Stream head.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
Guidlines for procesing the
.B M_IOCNAK
message are as follows:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
Intermediate modules that do not intend to process this message will not queue the
.B M_IOCNAK
message upstream.  In any event, an intermediate module must not flush or discard an
.B M_IOCNAK
message.
.IP ""
As only one
.BR ioctl (2s)
operation, and therefore, one
.B M_IOCNAK
message can be in progress on a Stream,
queueing of the message would cause unnecessary dealy in processing an
.BR ioctl (2s).
Only one high-priority message can be outstanding at the Stream head, so ordering of this message
with respect to other high priority messages is not an issue.
.IP \(bu
Modules or drivers should only issue a
.BR M_IOCNAK
message containing a
.I ioc_count
value in response to a non-tranparent
.BR ioctl (2s).
.IP \(bu
The message should be created by transforming a received
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
or
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)
message.
.IP \(bu
An intermediate module receiving an
.B M_IOCNAK
message on its write-side queue, will pass the message along in the same manner as any unexpected
high priority message: that is, it is passed to the next module and not subjected to flow control.
This permits
.BR ioctl (2s)
handling to perform correctly across a
.IR STREAMS -based
.BR pipe (4).
.IP \(bu
A driver receiving an
.BR M_IOCNAK
message discards the message.

.SH NOTICES
.PP
Under
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
.[
lfs
.]
it is not possible to return an error and a return value at the same time.  This is due to a
.B Linux
limitation in this regard.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
The
.B M_IOCNAK
.I STREAMS
message is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP STREAMS" ,
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
The order and size of the various members of the
.BR iocblk (9)
structure, and the associated aligned
.BR copyreq (9)
and
.BR copyresp (9)
structures, vary in
.I STREAMS
from implementation to implementation.  Some implementations have different structure definitions
depending upon the word size of a specific architecture.
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
.[
lfs
.]
follows the
.IR "SVR 4.2"
implementation as closely as possible.
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will not rely upon a specific overall size of the
.BR ioclk (9)
structure, or the offset or alignment of any of its members.
See
.BR iocblk (9)
for additional compatibiltiy information.
.IP \(em
.B M_IOCNAK
is has the wrong message type value on older versions of
.IR LiS .
.[
lis
.]
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will use
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
.[
lfs

instead of
.IR LiS .

.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.
