.SH NAME
.B mi_next_ptr

.\"

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #define _AIX_SOURCE
.br
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/ddi.h>
.HP
caddr_t \fBmi_next_ptr\fR(caddr_t \fIstate\fR);
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I state
The state pointer to the current list item.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR mi_next_ptr ()
is used to traverse module's list of open streams.  The
.I state
argument specifies the address of a per-instance list item, and the return
value indicates the address of the next item.  The first time
.BR mi_next_ptr ()
is called, the
.I state
argument should be initialized with the value of the static pointer that was
passed to the
.BR mi_open_comm (9)
utility.
Subsequent calls to
.BR mi_next_ptr ()
should pass the address which was returned by the previous call, until a
.B NULL
address is returned, indicating that the end of the list has been reached.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.BR mi_next_ptr ()
succeeds, it returns a pointer to the next state;
when it fails, it returns
.BR NULL .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR mi_next_ptr ()
fails when it hits the end of the list.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR mi_next_ptr ()
can be called from any context.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR mi_next_ptr ()
is not safe from deletions.  A separate mutex or semaphore is required by the
caller to protect the list from deletions between calls to
.BR mi_next_ptr ().
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR mi_next_ptr ()
is a
.IR AIX \(rg-specific
function:
.B _AIX_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_AIX
defined.
.\"
.\"
.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
Following is an example of an MP-safe use of
.BR mi_next_ptr ():
.RS
.nf
\fC\s-1
static caddr_t xxx_state = NULL;

spin_lock_t xxx_state_spinlock = SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED;

int
list_some_data(void) {

        caddr_t item;
        unsigned long flags;

        spin_lock_irqsave(&xxx_state_spinlock, &flags);

        for (item = xxx_state; item; item = mi_next_ptr(item)) {
                xxx_priv_t *priv = (xxx_priv_t *) item;
                cmd_err(CE_NOTE, "some_data is %ld", priv->some_data);
        }

        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&xxx_state_spinlock, &flags);

.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR mi_next_ptr ()
is compatible with
.IR AIX \(rg
with the following portablity considerations:
.IP \(em
Use of
.BR mi_next_ptr ()
requires different include file sequences on
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
than on
.IR AIX \(rg.
.IR AIX \(rg
includes
.B <pse/mi.h>
and
.B <sys/stream.h>
only.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_next_ptr ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR AIX \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR AIX \(rg
drivers to
.IR Linux \(rg.
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Lnux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR AIX \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_next_ptr ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR AIX \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR mi_next_ptr ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
