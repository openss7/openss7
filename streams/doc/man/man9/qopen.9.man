.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "int qopen(queue_t *" q ", dev_t *" devp ", int " oflag ", int " sflag ", cred_t *" crp );
.\"

.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
pointer to the module or driver's read queue.
.TP
.I devp
pointer to the device number.
.TP
.I oflag
open flags.
.TP
.I sflag
stream flags.
.TP
.I crp
pointer to the credentials of the opening user.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR qopen ()
is an internal
.I STREAMS
function which invokes the
.I STREAMS
module or driver open routine associated with
.IR q .
.TP
.I q
is a pointer to the read queue of a newly allocated queue pair for the module
or driver,  allocated with
.BR allocq (9)
and for which a
.B qinit
structure was associated with
.BR setq (9).
.TP
.I devp
is a pointer to a
.B dev_t
device number.
For a driver,
.B devp
points to the device number of the
.I STREAMS
character special file that was
opened that invoked the driver's open routine.
A driver open routine returns the resulting device
number to the area pointed to by
.IR devp .
See
.BR makedevice (9).
For a module,
.B devp
points to the device number of the
.I STREAMS
character special file under whose
stream file the module is being pushed.  A module open routine does not alter
the device number but may use the passed in device number to determine which
device the module is ultimately being pushed over.
.TP
.I oflag
contains the open flags for use by the driver's open routine and will contain
a bitwise or of one or more of the following flags:
.RS
.TP
.B FREAD
the \fISTREAMS\fR special file is opened for read.
.TP
.B FWRITE
the \fISTREAMS\fR special file is opened for write.
.TP
.B FEXCL
the \fISTREAMS\fR special file is opened with exclusive access.
.TP
.B FNDELAY
the \fISTREAMS\fR special file is opened for non-blocking operation.
.RE
.TP
.I sflag
contains \fISTREAMS\fP flags for use by the module or driver's open routine.
Modules are always opened with
.I sflag
set to
.BR MODOPEN .
Drivers are opened with
.B DRVOPEN
or
.B CLONEOPEN
depending upon whether they were opened via a clone driver or not.  For opens
subsequent to the first open and before close, will always be opened with
.BR DRVOPEN .
.I sflag
and will contain one of:
.RS
.TP
.B DRVOPEN
the module was opened as a
.I STREAMS
driver.  Drivers opened subsequent to the first open, but before close, will
always be opened with this flag.
.TP
.B MODOPEN
the module was opened as a
.I STREAMS
module.  Modules will always be opened with this flag.
.TP
.B CLONEOPEN
the module was opened via the
.BR clone (4)
driver.  This flag will only be set on the initial open of a driver that was
made via a clone driver.  This setting of
.I sflag
requests that the driver assign a unique minor device number to the newly
created stream.
.PP
.RE
.TP
.I crp
points to a
.BR cred_t (9)
structure which provides the credentials of the process invoking the open,
structured as follows:
.RS
.nf
\fC\s-2
typedef struct cred {
        uid_t cr_ruid, cr_uid, cr_suid, cr_fsuid;
        gid_t cr_rgid, cr_gid, cr_sgid, cr_fsgid;
        int cr_ngroups;
        gid_t cr_groups[NGROUPS];
} cred_t;

.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR qopen ()
returns zero (0) and the device number associated with a driver in the area
pointed to by
.IR devp .
Upon failure,
.BR qopen ()
returns a negative error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
When
.BR qopen ()
fails, it returns a negative error number as follows:
.TP
.RB [ ENOPKG ]
the module has no qopen routine.
.PP
.BR qopen ()
can also return any error returned by the modules qopen routine.  In general,
the following errors are provided by module qopen routines:
.TP
.RB [ EXNIO ]
the qopen routine for the module or driver failed.
.TP
.RB [ EIO ]
a module was opened as a driver, or visa versa.
.TP
.RB [ EPERM ]
the opening process did not have sufficient credentials to open the specified
device or push the specified module.
.TP
.RB [ ENOMEM ]
memory could not be allocated to hold the module or driver's private
structures.
.TP
.RB [ ENOSR "], [" ENOBUFS ]
a buffer could not be allocated as part of the open.
.TP
.RB [ ENOSR ]
a
.I STREAMS
resource could not be allocated as part of the open.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.BR qopen ()
should only be called from user context with the open semaphore held and a
write lock on the stream head.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
uses the inode semaphore for the inode associated with the streams special
file for open/close locking.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.BR qopen ()
must be called single-threaded with the open semaphore and the stream write
lock held.
.PP
Driver and module
.I q->q_info->qi_open
procedures are always invoked single-threaded and exclusive in accordance with
descriptions for SVR 4
.[
svr4
.]
as described in
.IR "\*(lqThe Magic Garden\*(rq" .
.[
magic
.]
This is also consistent with exclusive open/close access under
.IR Solaris \(rg.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR qopen ()
is an internal
.I STREAMS
function that is not intended to be called
directly by the module or driver writer.  See
.BR open (2)
and
.B I_PUSH
under
.BR streamio (7)
for indirect methods of invoking this function.  This function is exported for
use by clone drivers and stream heads.  See
.BR register_inode (9).
