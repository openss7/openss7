.SH NAME
.B pullupmsg
\- pull up the bytes in a \fISTREAMS\fP message
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "int pullupmsg(mblk_t *" mp ", int " len );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I mp
the message to pull up.
.PD 0
.TP
.I len
the number of bytes to pull up.
.PD
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR pullupmsg ()
attempts to merge the first
.I len
data bytes of the passed in message pointed to by
.I mp
into a single data block.
.PP
If
.I len
is -1,
.BR pullupmsg ()
attempts to merge all of the leading data blocks of the same type from the passed in message pointed
to by
.I mp
into a single data block.
.PP
If there is nothing to alter (that is, the initial data block contains greater than or equal to
.I len
bytes, or there is only one data block in the message),
.BR pullupmsg ()
returns success without altering the message.  (This is also true in the case where the passed in
length,
.IR len ,
is zero (0).)
.PP
If the number of bytes in the initial blocks of the passed in message pointed to by
.I mp
is less than the number of bytes specified in
.IR len ,
.BR pullupmsg ()
will fail.
.PP
.BR pullupmsg ()
does not allocate a new message block, but attaches the altered data block to the existing initial
message block.
.BR pullupmsg ()
does not deallocate the message blocks or data blocks that were absorbed into the new data block:
instead,
.BR pullupmsg ()
sets the
.I b_wptr
to the
.I b_rptr
in the message blocks of all absorbed data blocks.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR pullupmsg ()
is typically used where it is necessary for the first number of bytes in a
.I STREAMS
message be contiguous to meet the needs of the routines processing the bytes contained in the
message.  In this case,
.BR pullupmsg ()
is called before processing the bytes.
.PP
The primary difference between
.BR pullupmsg ()
and
.BR msgpullup (9)
is that
.BR pullupmsg ()
reuses the message blocks and data blocks where possible,
.BR msgpullup (9)
always copies.  This is similar to the differences between
.BR dupmsg (9)
and
.BR copymsg (9)
in that
.BR pullupmsg ()
is more efficient under many circumstances.  Nevertheless,
.BR pullupmsg ()
can be problematic in a multiprocessor (MP) environment in that it may be difficult to ensure that
the caller has exclusive access to the passed in message.  Because
.BR msgpullup (9)
treats the passed in message as read-only, there are fewer difficulties on MP architectures.  This
is probably why
.BR msgpullup (9)
was originally added to
.IR "SVR 4.0 MP STREAMS" .
.PP
Perhaps it is because
.BR pullupmsg ()
has the notion of architectural alignment, whereas
.BR msgpullup (9)
does not.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR pullupmsg ()
returns true (1), and the message pointed to by
.I mp
is altered.
Upon failure,
.BR pullupmsg ()
returns false (0), and the passed in message is unaltered.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR pullupmsg ()
fails and returns false (0) when the number bytes in the initial data blocks of the same type in the
passed in message pointed to by
.I mp
is less than the number of bytes specified in
.IR len ;
or, when the passed in message pointer,
.IR mp ,
is
.BR NULL ;
when the passed in length,
.IR len ,
is less than minus one; or, when allocation of the necessary blocks fails.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR pullupmsg ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures, callouts, callbacks, soft
interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR pullupmsg ()
is MP-safe; however, the caller is responsible for ensuring exclusive access to all components of
the passed in message.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
It is not always necessary to allocate a new data block to contain the pulled up bytes: if there is
sufficient room in the initial data block, and the initial data block is properly aligned (it is
aligned to the layer 1 cache line for the architecture), the initial data block can be reused.
.BR pullupmsg ()
checks for this possibility and efficiently reuses the initial data block where possible.
.PP
If the data block is not reused and a new data block is allocated and attached onto the initial
message block, then the existing inital data block is freed.  This has the side effect that any free
routine callback is also executed.  Also, any message blocks that are subsumed into the initial data
block are also freed, possibly excuting the free routine callbacks of their associated data blocks
as well.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
Data blocks allocated during the pullup operation are allocated with priority
.BR BPRI_MED .
See
.BR allocb (9)
for more information on block allocation priorities.  Data buffers allocated during the pullup
operation are allocated with flag
.BR KM_NOSLEEP ", " KM_CACHEALIGN " and " KM_DMA .
See
.BR kmem_alloc (9)
for more information on memory allocation flags.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR pullupmsg ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" , 
.[
usldk
.]
and implementations based on
.I SVR 4
.[
svr4dk
.] 
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.IR AIX \(rg,
.IR HP-UX \(rg,
.IR IRIX \(rg,
.IR OSF/1 \(rg,
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.IR Super-UX \(rg,
.IR UnixWare \(rg,
and
.IR UXP/V \(rg
all document
.BR pullupmsg ().

Whereas, only
.IR HP-UX \(rg,
.IR IRIX \(rg,
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.IR Super-UX \(rg,
and
.IR UnixWare \(rg,
document
.BR msgpullup (9).
.IR Solaris \(rg
states that
.BR msgpullup (9)
is a \*(lq\)DKI-compliant replacement for the older
.BR pullupmsg ()
routine,\*(rq that is \*(lq\)not included in the DKI and will be removed form the system in a future
release\*(rq and that users \*(lq\)are strongly encouraged to use
.BR msgpullup (9)
instead of
.BR pullupmsg ().\*(rq
.[
soldoc
.]
.IR UnixWare \(rg
documentation indicates that
.IR "SCO OpenServer" \(rg
is stuck with
.BR pullupmsg ().
.[
uw7doc
.]
.IR UnixWare \(rg
documentation
indicates that
.BR pullupmsg ()
was only applicable to
.IR "SVR 4.0" ,
.IR "SVR 4.1 ES" ,
and
.IR "SVR 4.2" .
That is, no multiprocessor (MP) releases support
.BR pullupmsg ().
.IR UnixWare \(rg
documentation also indicates that use of
.BR pullupmsg ()
can panic a multiprocessor (MP)
.IR UnixWare \(rg " 7
system, and yet is suitable for a multiprocessor (MP)
.IR "SCO OpenServer" \(rg
system.
.[
uw7doc
.]
So, although
.BR msgpullup (9)
is recommended by
.IR Solaris \(rg
and
.IR UnixWare \(rg
instead of
.BR pullupmsg (),
.BR pullupmsg ()
is by far the more popular interface and has the widest support.
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
modules and drivers may use
.BR pullupmsg ()
instead of
.BR msgpullup (9).
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
supports both in an MP-safe way.
.IP \(em
.IR UnixWare \(rg
indicates that the memory for data buffers returned by both
.BR pullupmsg ()
and
.BR msgpullup (9)
(through
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" )
are suitable for worst-case DMA and are phsysically contiguous.
.[
uw7doc
.]
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
also exhibits this behaviour.  Physical contiguous data buffers, aligned on a layer 1 cache boundary
and suitable for worst-case DMA are allocated by
.BR pullupmsg ()
but not
.BR msgpullup (9).
If no data buffer is allocated, the characteristics of the existing data buffer prevail.  If
worst-case DMA suitable memory is necessary, it must be allocated as such in the first place.  You
cannot use
.BR pullupmsg ()
to change the character of the data buffer.
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
modules and drivers will no make any assumptions about the phsyical contiguity or suitability for
worst-case DMA of data buffers allocated via
.BR msgpullup (9).
.IP \(em
Symbol
.BR lis_pullupmsg ()
is provided for compatibility with
.IR LiS .
See
.BR liscompat (9).
.BR lis_pullupmsg ()
simply calls
.BR pullupmsg ().
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.
