.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B qband
structure contains pointers into the linked list of messages on the
.BR queue (9).
These pointers,
.I qb_first
and
.IR qb_last ,
denote the beginning and end of messages for the particular band.
When there are no messages in the band, both
.I qb_first
and
.I qb_last
are
.BR NULL ;
with any messages in the band, both are
.RB non- NULL .
.PP
The
.I qb_count
member is analogous to the
.BR queue (9)'s
.I q_count
member.  However,
.I qb_count
only applies to the messages on the
.BR queue (9)
in the band of data flow represented by the corresponding
.B qband
structure.  In contrast,
.I q_count
contains information regarding normal (priority band zero) and high priority messages.
.PP
Each band has a separate high and low water mark,
.I qb_hiwat
and
.IR qb_lowat .
These are initially set to the
.BR queue (9)'s
.I q_hiwat
and
.I q_lowat
respectively.  Modules and drivers may change these values if desired using the
.BR strqset (9)
utility.
.PP
Three flags,
.BR QB_FULL ,
.BR QB_WANTW ,
and
.BR QB_BACK ,
are defined for
.IR qb_flag .
.B QB_FULL
denotes that the particular band is full.
.B QB_WANTW
indicates that the neighbouring feeding queue (with a service procedure) wanted to write to the band
when it was full.
.B QB_BACK
is set when the
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure is scheduled as a result of back-enabling from a queue being fed by this one for which
flow control has subsided for this queue band.
.PP
The
.B qband
structures are not preallocated per
.BR queue (9).
Rather, they are allocated when a normal priority message with a non-zero
.I b_band
is placed on the queue from
.BR appq (9),
.BR insq (9),
.BR putq (9),
or
.BR putbq (9).
When a 
.B qband
structure does not exist for the band corresponding to
.IR b_band ,
.I STREAMS
tries to allocate
.B qband
structures for all non-existent bands up to and including the band of the message and places the
resulting
.BR qband
structures into a reverse sorted
.I q_bandp
list on the
.BR queue (9).
Since band allocation can fail, these routines return
.I false
.RB ( 0 )
on failure and
.I true
.RB ( 1 )
on success.
.BR strqset (9)
and
.BR strqget (9)
will also cause
.B qband
allocation to occur.
.PP
Once a
.B qband
structure is allocated, it remains associated with the queue until the queue is freed.
Therefore, it is possible to ensure that no band allocation failures will result by preallocating
any necessary band from a module's
.IR qi_qopen (9)
procedure using
.BR strqset (9)
or
.BR strqget (9).
.PP
See,
.BR appq (9),
.BR insq (9),
.BR putq (9),
.BR putbq (9),
.BR strqset (9),
and
.BR strqget (9),
for more information.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
Functions that operate on a queue band
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures, call-outs, callbacks, soft
interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves) and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.PP
The queue band pointers and members, with the exception of the
.I qb_flag
member, are protected by the queue reader-writer lock,
.RI ( q_rwlock )
in the parent
.BR queue (9)
structure.
The
.I qb_flag
member is protected using atomic bit operations.
Whenever a queue reader-write lock is acquired, local interrupts are suppressed, allowing
utilities that manipulate the
.BR queue (9)
and
.B qband
structures to be called from any context.
.PP
Some queue and queue band utilities have a back-enable side-effect.  These are utilities that
remove messages from the queue or queue band:
.BR rmvq (9),
.BR getq (9),
.BR flushq (9),
.BR flushband (9).
Because the back-enable side-effect,
.BR qbackenable (9),
can only be invoked from specific contexts, these utilities are more restrictive.  See
.BR rmvq (9),
.BR getq (9),
.BR flushq (9),
.BR flushband (9),
for more information.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
Members of the
.B qband
structure should not be accessed directly by
.I STREAMS
modules or drivers.  Portable
.I STREAMS
modules and drivers should use the facilities provided by
.BR strqget (9)
and
.BR strqset (9)
for implementation and architecture independence, as well as MP-safety.
.PP
The
.B qband
structure is only a subset of the
.B qbinfo
structure used by the
.I STREAMS
scheduler.  Additional hidden members are present in the
.B qbinfo
structure.

.I LiS
allocates
.B qband
structures on demand, links them in a sparse array, and will also reuse
.B qband
structures that were previously allocated for bands that are currently empty.  This is not a good
approach because user established band high and low water marks will be reset to those of the
.BR queue (9)
structure when a subsequent message is placed on the reused band.  Also, this makes it difficult to predict when
.BR appq (9),
.BR insq (9),
.BR putq (9),
.BR putbq (9),
.BR strqget (9),

Portable

modules and drivers can rely on intermediate band structure being allocated when a normal priority
