.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP

a pointer to the name of the

driver
.TP
.I minor
the minor device number
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR autopush_search ()
performs the same function within the kernel as is provided to user space via
the
.B SAD_GAP
IO control to the
.BR sad (4)
.I STREAMS
Adminsitrative Driver.  This function finds and returns a pointer to
the autopush list associated with the \fISTREAMS\fR driver name specified by
.IR name ,
and the character minor device specified by
.IR minor .
The autopush list is described by a pointer to a
.B strapush
structure formatted as follows:
.nf
\fC\s-1
struct strapush {
        unit_t ap_cmd;
        major_t sap_major;
        minor_t sap_minor;
        minor_t sap_lastminor;
        unit_t sap_npush;
        unit_t sap_list[MAXAPUSH][FMNAMESZ + 1];
};
\s+1\fP
.fi
.TP \w'\ sap_lastminor\ 'u
.I ap_cmd
Not meaningful.  The caller should ignore the value returned in this field.
.TP
.I sap_major
The character major device number associated with the \fISTREAMS\fP device to
which this autopush list belongs.
.TP
.I sap_minor
The first character minor device number in a range associated with the
\fISTREAMS\fP device to which this autopush list belongs.  This value will be
less than or equal to the
.I minor
argument.
.TP
.I sap_lastminor
The last character minor device number in a range associated with the
\fISTREAMS\fP device to which this autopush list belongs.  This value will be
greater than or equal to the
.I minor
argument.
.TP
.I sap_npush
The number of modules in the autopush list.  This number will be greater than
or equal to one and less than or equal to
.BR MAXAPUSH .
.TP
.I sap_list
The array of module names that contains
.I sap_npush
module names representing the module autopush list.
.\"
.\"
.PP
.BR autopush_search ()
is useful along with
.BR autopush_find (9),
.BR autopush_add (9),
and
.BR autopush_del (9)
when registering
.I STREAMS
character devices with
.BR register_strdev (9).
.BR autopush_search ()
permits a kernel module to find the autopush list for a named device driver.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR autopush_search ()
is a
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" -specific
function.
.BR autopush_search ()
should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers or modules.  Instead, the
user-space
.I STREAMS
autopush utility
.BR sad (8)
should be used instead.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR autopush_search ()
returns a pointer to the
.B strapush
structure describing the autopush list for the requested
.I STREAMS
device.
Upon failure,
.BR autopush_search ()
returns
.BR NULL .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR autopush_search ()
fails and returns
.B NULL
when the autopush list associated with
.I name
is empty, or does not contain an entry for the character minor device number
.IR minor .
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR autopush_search ()
can only be called from process context.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR autopush_search ()
is MP-safe.  The caller is responsible to ensure exclusive access to the
passed in
.IR name .
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR autopush_search ()
simply locates the
.B strapush
structure associated with the
.I name
and
.I minor
arguments.  The module name list is neither validated, nor are any kernel
modules loaded as a side-effect of the lookup.

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR autopush_find ()
has no known bugs.
