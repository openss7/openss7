.SH NAME
.B allocb_physreq
\- allocate a \fISTREAMS\fP message and data block
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #define _UW7_SOURCE
.br
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "mblk_t *allocb_physreq(size_t " size ", unsigned int " bpri ", physreq_t *" physrp );
.\"
.\"
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I size
the size of the message buffer to allocate
.TP
.I bpri
the priority of the request.
.TP
.I physrp
a pointer to a
.BR physreq (9)
structure specifying the physical requirements of the data buffer.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR allocb_physreq ()
allocates a message block and a data block of the requested
.IR size " and " bpri
subject to the memory constraints specified by the structure indicated by
.IR physrp .
.I physrp
points to a
.BR physreq (9)
structure.
.PP
If the requested
.I size
is less than the
.I STREAMS
constant
.B FASTBUF
then a data block of size
.B FASTBUF
will be created.
If the requested
.I size
is larger than the
.I STREAMS
constant
.B FASTBUF
then a data block of size
.I size
will be created.
.PP
The
.I bpri
can be one of the following values:
.sp
.TS
expand tab(:);
lb0ls.
BPRI_LO\ \ :requests a low priority message buffer.
BPRI_MED\ \ :requests a medium priority message buffer.
BPRI_HI\ \ :requests a high priority message buffer.
.TE
.PP
If
.BR allocb_physreq ()
is called with a
.I bpri
other than
.BR BPRI_HI ", " BPR_MED " or " BPRI_LO ,
the request will be serviced as
.BR BPRI_LO .
.PP
.BR allocb_physreq ()
accepts a pointer
.I phsyreq_ptr
to a
.BR physreq (9)
structure providing the memory constraints on the resulting data block is
provided as an argument.  If
.I physrp
is
.BR NULL ,
calling
.BR allocb_physreq ()
returns the identical result as would a call to
.BR allocb (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR allocb_physreq ()
will
return an
.BR mblk_t (9)
pointer to the allocated message block.
The allocated message block will have a data block type of
.BR M_DATA (9).
All bands and flags will be cleared.
.I b_rptr
and
.I b_wptr
will be set to the beginning of the data block buffer area.
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR allocb_physreq ()
will
return a
.B NULL
message pointer.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When an error occurs,
.BR allocb_physreq ()
will return a
.B NULL
message pointer.
.PP
.BR allocb_physreq ()
will only fail if there is insufficient memory to allocate the necessary
datastructures for the message block, data block or data buffer, given the
value of
.I size
and
.IR bpri ,
subject to the specified memory constraints specified by
.IR  physrp .
.PP
Failure to allocate a message block is typically followed by a call to
.BR bufcall (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR allocb_physreq ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR allocb_physreq ()
is MP-safe.  The caller has exclusive access to the returned message.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR allocb_physreq ()
is a
.IR UnixWare \(rg-specific
function:
.B _UW7_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_UW7
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_UW7_MODULE
defined.
.PP
.BR allocb_physreq ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR UnixWare \(rg
and, despite the description above, ignores the
.I physrp
argument.
.PP
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules should not use
.BR allocb_physreq ().
To control the physical requirement of the memory allocated, allocate the
memory using a suitable kernel memory allocator (such as
.BR kmalloc (9)
or
.BR get_freepages (9)
with suitable
.I gpf_flags
such as
.BR GFP_DMA )
and then use
.BR esballoc (9)
to allocate the message block.

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR allocb_physreq ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR allocb_physreq ()
is source level compatible with
.IR UnixWare \(rg
and
.IR LiS ,
with the following considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
Despite the description above,
.BR allocb_physreq ()
is not specially implemented and results in a simple call to
.BR allocb (9)
with the argument
.I physrp
being largely ignored.
.IR LiS
has the same behaviour.
.IP \(em
.I STREAMS
modules relying on
.BR allocb_physreq ()
should consider the following aspects of
.B Linux
memory allocation: (1) allocations are always aligned to the next largest
power of 2 boundary greater than the requested size; (2) allocations of
greater than a page size result in contiguous memory allocations; (3)
allocations of greater than a page size are aligned to a page boundary.
.IP \(em
Symbol
.BR lis_allocb_physreq ()
is provided for compatibility with LiS.  See
.BR liscompat (9).
.BR lis_allocb_physreq ()
simply calls
.BR allocb_physreq ()
directly.
.IP \(em
This function is not provided by
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
nor any other
.I SVR 4
based implementation with the exception of
.IR UnixWare \(rg
and
.IR LiS ,
.RB ( LiS
largely for compatibility with
.IR UnixWare \(rg).
.IP \(em
.BR allocb_physreq ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR UnixWare \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR UnixWare \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structure and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR UnixWare \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR allocb_physreq ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR UnixWare \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.  Any and all functionality provided by
.BR allocb_physreq ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.
