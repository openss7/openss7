.SH NAME

\- \fISTREAMS\fP normal reserved message
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
.PP
The
.B M_RSE
message block is a
.BR datab (9)
structure and associated data buffer that contains unstructured data.
.PP
An
.B M_RSE
message is a normal priority message that consists of one
.B M_RSE
message block followed by an unspecified number of message blocks of unspecified type.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B M_RSE
message is a normal priority message reserved for internal use by driver and module writers.
.PP
The message format is one
.B M_RSE
message block followed by an unspecified number of message blocks of unspecified type.  The precise
form of the message must be determined according to the internal use of the message.
.\"
.PP
.B M_RSE
message cannot be generated directly by a user level process.
.B M_RSE
messages arriving at the
Stream head
will be discarded (ignored and freed).
.B M_RSE
messages can be generated and consumed by drivers and modules.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
In general, an
.B M_RSE
message should not be used where an
.BR M_CTL (9)
message will do.
.B M_RSE
is not really intended for inter-module communication but for cases where a specialized,
non-portable communication facility is required.  This message can also be used to distinguish
messages that a driver or module places on its own queues (e.g, when passing messages across a
multiplexing driver).
.PP
Nevertheless, to support the passing of
.B M_RSE
message between modules or between driver and module, when necessary and appropriate, the following
guidelines should be followed by modules and dirvers with regard to the
.B M_RSE
message:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
Intermediate modules that do not recognize an
.B M_RSE
message must pass the message along in the same manner as ordinary normal priority messages.  That
is, they are subject to flow control and must retain their order with respect to other normal
priority messages within the
Stream.
.IP \(bu
A driver that does not recognize an
.B M_RSE
message, discards the message.
.IP \(bu
A driver or module processing an
.B M_RSE
message does so with regard its own internal definition.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
The
.B M_RSE
.I STREAMS
message is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP STREAMS" ,
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.B M_RSE

Portable

drivers and modules will use
