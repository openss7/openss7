.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I toid
the timeout identifier returned by
.BR timeout (9)
or
.BR qtimeout (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR untimeout ()
stops a timer previously started with
.BR timeout (9).
.I toid
is the timer identifier that was returned from a previous call to
.BR timeout (9).
.PP
.BR untimeout ()
is typically used to stop timers before they expire, and to deallocate timers
before a stream is closed.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR untimeout ()
returns a
.B timo_t
defined as follows:
.sp
.nf
typedef unsigned long toid_t;
typedef unsigned long timeout_id_t;
.fi
.PP
The return value from
.BR untimeout ()
is undefined and ignored.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR untimeout ()
fails silently
.RI ( retval
is ignored) when
the timer associated with the timer identifier
.I toid
no longer exists or is invalid.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR untimeout ()
can be called from any context including: user context,
.IR qi_qopen (9),
.IR qi_qclose (9),
.IR qi_putp (9)
or
.IR qi_srvp (9),
procedures,
.BR bufcall (9),
.BR qbufcall (9),
.BR timeout (9),
or
.BR qtimeout (9)
callback functions,
or interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR untimeout ()
is MP-safe; however, the caller of
.BR untimeout ()
must ensure that the callback function has not returned running before
calling
.BR untimeout ().
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR untimeout ()
can be called with a
.I toid
returned by
.BR timeout (9),
or
.BR qtimeout (9).
.PP
.BR untimeout ()
must be called for all outstanding timeout calls from the
.IR qi_qclose (9)
procedure of the modules before exiting and unloading.
.PP
Because
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
uses an out-dating pointer for the returned
.BR toid_t ,
.BR untimeout ()
must be called promptly for outstanding buffer calls.

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR untimeout ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR untimeout ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4"
.[
svr4dk
.]
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
The
.IR UnixWare \(rg
function prototype returns
.BR void .
.IP \(em
Under
.IR LiS ,
.[
lis
.]
.BR timeout (9)
creates a Linux timer structure, assigns it a sequential integer timer
identifier, and places it in a timer list.  Whenever
.I LiS
stops a timer, it
checks the list for the integer timer identifier with interrupts disabled.
This is an exhaustive linear search.  This is inefficient.
.I STREAMS
drivers or modules that stop timers often will experience poorer performance
than if the Linux kernel timer facility was used directly.

.\"Symbol

.IP \(em
.IR AIX \(rg
.[

describes this function as accepting an
.B int
.I bcid
and returning an
.B int
return value.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
use of an
.B int
for
.BR toid_t " and " timeout_id_t
maintains compatibility with
.IR "SVR 3"
.[
svr3spg
.]
based systems maintaining the
.B int
prototype.
.IP \(em
.IR Solaris \(rg
.[
soldoc
.]
describes this function as having the following prototype:
.sp
.nf
.BI "clock_t untimeout(timeout_id_t " toid );
.fi
.sp
The
.B clock_t
return value is described as being -1 when the
.I toid
is not found and zero or positive otherwise.
.IP \(em
Both
.IR AIX \(rg
.[
aixdoc
.]
and
.IR OSF/1 \(rg
.[
osfdoc
.]
have different prototypes for
.BR timeout (9)
and
.BR untimeout (9)
when used for
.I STREAMS
as when used for other drivers.  The prototypes for
.BR timeout (9)
and
.BR untimeout (9)
for use by
.I STREAMS
are the old
.I SVR 3
.[
svr3spg
.]
definitions which use an
.B int
for the
.BR toid_t .
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.
