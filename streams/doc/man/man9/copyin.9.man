.SH NAME
.B copyin
\- copy user data in from user space to kernel space.
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/dki.h>
.HP
.BI "int copyin(const void *" from ", void *" to ", size_t " len );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I from
a pointer to user memory where data is to be copied from.
.TP
.I to
a pointer to kernel memory where data is to be copied to.
.TP
.I len
the length of the data to copy.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR copyin ()
verifies that
.I len
bytes of memory at current user-space address
.I from
are valid for read and then copies those bytes to the kernel address
.IR to .
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR copyin ()
copies the requested bytes and
returns zero (0).
Upon failure,
.BR copyin ()
does nothing but return a negative error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR copyin ()
does nothing but return an appropriate negative error number as follows:
.TP \w'\ [EFAULT]\ 'u
.RB [ EFAULT ]
the buffer specified by
.IR from " and " len
extends outside the user's valid address space.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR copyin ()
can only be called from user context.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR copyin ()
is MP-safe and does not require the holding of any global locks.
.\"
.\"
.\".SH NOTICES
.\".PP
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR copyin ()
simply calls the Linux
.BR copy_from_user (9)
function, with the first two arguments reversed.
If optimization is used, the call is inlined.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR copyin ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[

and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,

.BR copyin ()
runs faster than the LiS equivalent.

Symbol
.BR lis_copyin ()
is provided for compatibility with LiS.  See
.BR liscompat (9).
.BR lis_copyin ()
calls
.BR copyin ()
directly.

Note that
.BR lis_copyin ()
was deprecated as of
.IR "LiS 2.18.0" .
