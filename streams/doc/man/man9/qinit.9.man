.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B qinit
structure is a statically allocated structure that is used in the definition of a
.I STREAMS
module or driver.
When a
Stream
is created as a result of a call to
.BR open (2s)
or
.BR pipe (2s),
particulars about the
Stream head
and
driver queue pair are initialized to point to (usually two of) these structures.
.PP
Pointers to two or four
.B qinit
structures are used as the primary definition of a
.I STREAMS
module or driver in the
.BR streamtab (9)
structure.
Two
.B qinit
structures are referenced for the read and write side of a module, and two pairs of
.B qinit
structures are referenced for the read and write side of a driver, one pair for the upper
multiplexer and another for the lower multiplexer for a multiplexing driver.
.\"
.SS Module and Driver Entry Points
.PP
The
.IR qi_putp ,
.IR qi_srvp ,
.IR qi_qopen ,
.IR qi_qclose ,
and
.IR qi_qadmin
represent the primary functional entry points into the module or driver and are invoked at the
appropriate times by the
.I STREAMS
scheduler.
These are syncrhonous entry points in the sense that
.BR MP-STREAMS (9)
synchronization is performed at each entry point predicated on
.IR q .

.PP
The
.I qi_putp
and
.I qi_srvp
fields are significant in each
.B qinit
structure associated with a
.BR queue (9).
The
.IR qi_qopen ,
.IR qi_qclose ,
and
.I qi_qadmin
members are only significant in the
.B qinit
structure associated with the read-side
.BR queue (9)
structure.
.I STREAMS
ignores the values of the
.IR qi_qopen ,
.IR qi_qclose ,
and
.IR qi_qadmin ,
function pointers in the
.B qinit
structure associated with the
write-side
.BR queue (9)
structure of a queue pair.
.PP
.I qi_qopen
specifies the
.IR qi_qopen (9)
routine for the module or driver.
The
.IR qi_qopen (9)
routine is called whenever a new queue pair forming an instance of the module or driver is
allocated, initialized and inserted into a Stream, or whenever existing Stream is reopened, for each
module and driver in the Stream.  This routine permits the module or driver to perform whatever
module or driver private initialization is necessary before the queue pair becomes active in the
Stream, or to respond to a subsequent opening of the Stream.  Error numbers returned by this function
are reflected as error numbers returned in
.BR errno (3)
from the
.BR open (2s)
or
.BR I_PUSH (2s)
operation that invoked the routine.
All modules and drivers must have a
.BI qi_qopen
routine defined.
See
.IR qi_qopen (9)
for details.
.PP
.I qi_qclose
specifies the
.IR qi_qclose (9)
routine for the module or driver.
The
.IR qi_qclose (9)
routine is called before a queue pair forming an instance of the module or driver is
removed from the Stream and deallocated.  This routine permits the module or driver to perform
whatever module or driver private cleanup or deallocation is necessary before the queue pair is
deactivated and removed from the Stream.  Error numbers returned by this function are generally
discarded.
All modules and drivers must have a
.BI qi_qclose
routine defined.
See
.IR qi_qclose (9)
for details.
.PP
.I qi_putp
specifies the
.IR qi_putp (9)
procedure for the module or driver.
The
.IR qi_putp (9)
procedure is invoked during active use of the queue pair whenever a message is passed to either
queue of the queue pair, in either direction along the Stream, using the
.BR put (9)
or
.BR putnext (9)
.I STREAMS
utilities.
This procedure is responsible for processing, passing along, or queueing the message passed to the
queue.  A separate
.IR qi_putp (9)
procedure is normally associated with each queue in the queue pair forming an instance of the module
or driver.
The return value of the
.IR qi_putp (9)
procedure is ignored by
.IR STREAMS .
All modules and drivers must have a
.BI qi_putp
procedure defined.
See
.IR qi_putp (9)
for details.
.PP
.I qi_srvp
specifies the
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure for the module or driver.
The
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure for a module or driver services the messages that are placed on the corresponding message
queue.
The
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure is invoked by the
.I STREAMS
scheduler.
Queues are scheduled to have their
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedures executed (when a
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure is specified)
by
.I STREAMS
utility functions that queue or dequeue messages from message queues within the Stream.
The return value of the
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure is ignored by
.IR STREAMS .
It is optional for a module or driver to define a
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure: if one is not defined,
.I qi_srvp
is set to
.BR NULL .
See
.IR qi_srvp (9)
for details.
.PP
.I qi_qadmin
specifies the administrative routine return by
.BR getadmin (9)
for the module or driver.
The
.I qi_qadmin
function pointer is for a module private adminstrative function that is not normally used.
.I STREAMS
never invokes the
.I qi_qadmin
function; however, the
.BR getadmin (9)
utility can be used to locate this function and it may be invoked by a module or driver procedure,
or by any other kernel subsystem at the module designer's option.
It is optional for a module or driver to define a
.BR getadmin (9)
procedure: normally,
.I qi_qadmin
is set to
.BR NULL .
See
.IR qi_qadmin (9)
for details.
.PP
For a description of the use and guidelines for the
.IR qi_qadmin ,
.IR qi_qopen ,
.IR qi_qclose ,
.IR qi_putp ,
and
.IR qi_srvp ,
functions provided by a module or driver, see
.BR getadmin (9),
.IR qi_qopen (9),
.IR qi_qclose (9),
.IR qi_putp (9),
and
.IR qi_srvp (9).
.\"
.SS Initialization
.PP
The
.I qi_minfo
member points to a
.BR module_info (9)
structure that contains the name and identifier for the module or driver.  The
.I qi_minfo
.BR module_info (9)
structure also contains the initialization queue packet size and flow control limits used to
initialize
.BR queue (9)
structures when a queue pair is formed.
.PP
Four members of the
.BR queue (9)
structure,
.IR q_minpsz ,
.IR q_maxpsz ,
.IR q_hiwat ,
.IR q_lowat ,
are initialized from the corresponding members of the
.BR module_info (9)
structure,
.IR mi_minpsz ,
.IR mi_maxpsz ,
.IR mi_hiwat ,
.IR mi_lowat ,
pointed to by this structure.
These members of the
.BR queue (9)
structure are initialized from the associated
.B qinit
structure's referenced
.BR module_info (9)
structure.
The remaining two fields of the
.BR module_info (9)
structure,
.IR mi_idnum ,
and
.IR mi_idname ,
provide read-only information concerning the module identification number [see
.BR getmid (9)]
and module name, associated with the module or driver.
.PP
See
.BR queue (9)
and
.BR module_info (9)
for more information.
.\"
.SS Statistics
.PP
The
.I qi_mstat
member points to a
.BR module_stat (9)
structure that contains collected statistics for the module.  Statistics include the number of times
that each of the procedures were called as well a private statistics.  As the read and write side
queues can point to different
.B qinit
structures, a
.BR module_stat (9)
structure can be associated with each queue in the queue pair, or they can share one
.BR module_stat (9)
structure.
Providing a
.BR module_stat (9)
structure is optional: when not provided, the
.I qi_mstat
member is set to
.BR NULL .
.PP
.I STREAMS
will not maintain the statistics in this structure whether it is provided or not.  It is the
responsibility of the module or driver designer to increment counts in this structure as is
appropriate to the module.
Nevertheless, if an
.BR module_stat (9)
structure is provided, its counts can be examined with system administration utilities such as
.BR scls (8).
.PP
See
.BR module_stat (9)
for more information.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The
.B qinit
structure is statically allocated and associated with a statically allocated
.BR streamtab (9)
structure to define a
.I STREAMS
module or driver.
.PP
Once the associated
.BR streamtab (9)
structure has been registered with the
.I STREAMS
subsystem as a module or driver, all fields in the structure must be treated as read-only by a
module or driver.
The following guidelines pertain to the use of the fields in the
.B qinit
structure:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
Function pointers
.IR qi_qadmin ,
.IR qi_qopen ,
.IR qi_qclose ,
.IR qi_putp ,
.IR qi_srvp ,
must not be altered after the
.B streamtab (9)
structure is registered.
.IP \(bu
Of theses, only
.I qi_qadmin
can be called directly by the a module or driver.
.I qi_qopen
must only be called indirectly using the
.BR open (2s)
or
.BR I_PUSH (7)
.BR ioctl (2s).
.I qi_qclose
must only be called indirectly using the
.BR close (2s)
or
.BR I_POP (7)
.BR ioctl (2s).
.I qi_putp
must only be called via the appropriate
.I STREAMS
utility functions:
.BR put (9)
and
.BR putnext (9),
and then only in the appropriate contexts.
.IP \(bu
.I qi_srvp
must only be called by the
.I STREAMS
scheduler; that is, invoked with the
.I STREAMS
utility functions:
.BR qenable (9),
.BR putq (9),
.BR putbq (9),
or any utility invoking back-enabling.
.IP \(bu
The
.I qi_minfo
pointer must not be modified after registeration.  The point can, however, be read directly to find
the location of the
.BR module_info (9)
structure that corresponds to a given queue, queue pair or module.
See
.BR module_info (9)
for restrictions on the use of its members.
.IP \(bu
The
.I qi_mstat
pointer must not be modified after registration.  The pointer can, however, be read directly to find
the location of the
.BR module_stat (9)
structure that corresponds to a given queue pair or module.
See
.BR module_stat (9)
for restrictions on the use of its members.
.IP \(bu
The pointers to
.B qinit
structure from the
.BR streamtab (9)
structure for a module or driver must not be altered after the
.BR streamtab (9)
structure has been registered.
.IP \(bu
The pointer to a
.B qinit
structure contained within the
.BR queue (9)
structure must only be altered by the
Stream head.
