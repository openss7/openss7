.SH NAME
.B do_spipe
\- implement the \fBpipe\fR(2) system call
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/strsubr.h>
.HP
.BI "long do_spipe(int *" fds ");
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I fds
an array of two integers into which to return file descriptors for either end of the pipe.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS ,
internal,
implementation specific.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR do_spipe ()
is a
.B "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
internal implementation specific function that
creates a
.IR STREAMS -based
.BR pipe (4)
and returns the file descriptors for either end of the pipe in the two element integer array pointed
to by
.IR fds .
The difference between this and the usual
.B Linux
.BR do_pipe ()
call is that
.BR do_spipe ()
creates and returns a
.IR STREAMS -based
.BR pipe (4).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR do_spipe ()
is used by the Stream head,
.BR sth (4)
module, to emulate the
.BR pipe (2s)
system call using the
.BR I_PIPE (7)
.BR ioctl (2s)
call.
.PP
.BR do_spipe ()
has no other use or purpose, and will not be used by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules other than the Stream head,
.BR sth (4)
module.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR do_spipe ()
creates the pipe, returns the file descriptors in the array pointed to by
.I fds
and returns zero
.RB ( 0 );
upon failure,
it returns a negative error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR do_spipe ()
fails, the pipe is not created, and
.BR do_spipe ()
returns an appropriate negative error number as follows:
.TP \w'[\fBENAMETOOLONG\fR]\(em'u
.RB [ ENFILE ]
no available file descriptor for the calling process.
.TP
.RB [ ENFILE ]
the system file table is full.
.TP
.RB [ ENFILE ]
an
.B snode
could not be allocated in the
.BR specfs (5)
file system due to insufficient memory.
.TP
.RB [ ENOMEM ]
an
.B snode
could not be allocated in the
.BR specfs (5)
file system due to insufficient memory.
.TP
.RB [ ENODEV ]
the
.BR specfs (5)
file system could not be mounted.
.TP
.RB [ ENOMEM ]
a directory entry could not be allocated within the
.BR specfs (5)
file system due to insufficient memory.
.TP
.RB [ ENXIO ]
the
.BR pipe (4)
driver does not have file operation associated with it, or or does not support the
.BR open ()
file operation.
.PP
Any error returned by
.BR get_unused_fd ():
.TP \w'[\fBENAMETOOLONG\fR]\(em'u
.RB [ ENOMEM ]
a new array for the file table could not be allocated due to insufficient memory.
.TP
.RB [ EMFILE ]
too many files aare open in the system.
.PP
Any error returned by the
.BR pipe (4)
driver to its
.BR qi_qopen (9)
open routine.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR do_spipe ()
can only be invoked in user process context.  Note that this does include kernel module
initialization and termination routines as well as
.I STREAMS
driver or module
.IR qi_qopen (9)
open routines
and
.IR qi_qclose (9)
close routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR do_spipe ()
is MP-safe when called from the correct context.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR do_spipe ()
is an internal
.B "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
function intended to provide the back-end to a
.B Linux
system call.
It is only exported for use by the Stream head,
.BR sth (4),
for
.BR ioctl (2s)
emulation of the
.BR pipe (2s)
system call, when
.BR sth (4)
is configured as a separate loadable kernel module.  (The symbol need not be exported otherwise.)
.PP
.BR do_spipe ()
will not be called by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules calling this function that exist outside the
.B @PACKAGE@-@VERSION@
package, might be broken from verion to version and release to release.
