.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
It is the responsibility of a
.I STREAMS
driver putting a band zero (0)
normal message to the driver's read queue (e.g. with
.BR put "(9) or " putq (9))
to check for flow control using
.BR canput ()
before placing a message on the queue with
.BR put "(9) or " putq (9).
.PP
.BR canput ()
checks whether the
Stream
is flow controlled starting at
.IR q .
.BR canput ()
looks for the next queue with a
.IR qi_srvp (9)
service procedure, or no next queue (i.e. the
.I q_next
pointer is
.BR NULL ).
.PP
If this queue has the
.B QFULL
flag clear indicating that it is not full,
then
.BR canput ()
will return
.I true
.RB ( 1 ).
.PP
If this queue has the
.B QFULL
flag set indicating that it is full,
then
.BR canput ()
will set the
.B QWANTW
flag and return
.I false
.RB ( 0 ).
.PP
.BR canput ()
sets the
.B QWANTW
flag so that
.BR rmvq (9),
.BR getq (9),
.BR flushq (9),
or
.BR flushband (9),
will back-enable the
.IR qi_srvp (9)
service procedure feeding the flow controlled
queue \" or queue band
once the flow controlled
queue \" or queue band
is no longer full (i.e. messages have been read from the queue to reduce the
queue \" or queue band
count beneath the low water mark for the
queue, \" or queue band,
or emptying the queue, clearing the
.BR QFULL \" or " QB_FULL
flag).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
It is the responsibility of all
.I STREAMS
drivers putting
a normal, band zero, data message
.RB ( M_PROTO "(9), " M_DATA (9))
to a message queue to check for flow control using
.BR canput (9)
or
.BR bcanput (9)
for the
.I b_band
of the message
before placing a message on the queue with
.BR put (9)
or
.BR putq (9).
Each
Stream head,
Stream end
and multiplexing driver
is responsible for checking flow control before passing a message onto a
Stream.
Flow control is checked using one of
.BR canput (9)
or
.BR bcanput (9).
.I STREAMS
modules have different responsibilities, see
.RI \(lq USAGE \(rq
under
.BR canputnext (9)
or
.BR bcanputnext (9).
.PP
.BR canput ()
can be passed any queue pointer,
.IR q .
However, the caller is responsible for guaranteeing the validity of
.I q
across the call.
A pointer to either queue in a queue pair passed to callouts are guaranteed valid by
.IR STREAMS .
A pointer to either queue in a queue pair passed to callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom
halves), and interrupt service routines, and valid if the rules for cancellation of these callbacks
and routines are followed upon close and unlinking.
.PP
.BR canput ()
and
.BR bcanput (9)
will perform actions on a forward queue with no queue
.IR qi_srvp (9)
service procedure, but for which there is no forward queue
.RI ( q->q_next
is
.BR NULL ).
The reason for this is that a write queue at the Stream end (driver) might remove messages from the
message queue under conditions other than a service procedure.
For example, a driver write queue
.IR qi_putp (9)
put procedure could be designed to place all messages from the data stream onto the message queue.
When a transmit interrupt service routine runs, it can take message off of the queue using
.BR rmvq (9)
and use the messages so removed to fill the device's transmit buffer.  For flow control to work
correctly in this situation,
.BR canput (9)
and
.BR bcanput (9)
must still set the
.B QWANTW
or
.B QB_WANTW
flag when it encounters a driver write queue or queue band with the
.B QFULL
or
.B QB_FULL
flag set, so that
.BR getq (9),
.BR rmvq (9),
.BR flushq (9),
.BR flushband (9),
called from the interrupt service routine will still back-enable the Stream,
[see
.BR qbackenable (9)].
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR canput ()
will return
.I false
.RB ( 0 )
when the specified
.I STREAMS
message queue is flow controlled
and returns
.I true
.RB ( 1 )
when the specified
.I STREAMS
message queue is not flow controlled.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR canput ()
always succeeds for a valid
.IR q .
If
.I q
is invalid, the result is undefined.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR canput ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures, callouts, callbacks, soft
interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR canput ()
is MP-safe when called from any context.  However, the caller is responsible for the validity of the
passed in queue pointer,
.IR q ,
across the call.
.PP
The validity of either queue in the pair, and either
.I q_next
pointer for a queue in the pair, for the the queue pointer passed to a module procedure, callout
or syncrhonous callback functions, is guaranteed by
.IR STREAMS .
Any queue pointer in the pair passed as an argument to an asynchronous callback function
is also valid, providing the module or driver observes the rules for cancellation of asyncrhonous
callbacks on close.
.PP
When wishing to test flow control on a driver's read queue from an interrupt service routine, where
there is no
.IR qi_srvp (9)
service procedure defined for the read queue, a more portable approach is to call
.BR put (9)
instead and test flow control from within the read queue's
.IR qi_putp (9)
put procedure.
.PP
It is possible, due to race conditions in a
multiprocessor (MP) system, that
.BR canput ()
can be called for a queue and return
.I true
.RB ( 1 )
and yet the
Stream
becomes flow controlled before a
call to
.BR putnext (9).
The caller to
.BR putnext (9)
is then in violation of flow-control rules; however, the extent of this violation is bounded.
It is also possible, that
.BR canput ()
can be called for a queue and return
.I false
.RB ( 0 ),
and a queue utility retrieving a message from the full queue causes flow control to subside and the
service procedure of the caller to become back-enabled before the call to
.BR putq (9)
(in the case
.BR canput ()
is called from a
.IR qi_putp (9)
put procedure),
or
.BR putbq (9)
(in the case
.BR canput ()
is called from a
.IR qi_srvp (9)
service procedure).
In the case that the service procedure run before
.BR putq (9),
placing the message on the queue will invoke the service procedure again, when necessary.
In the case that the queue was enabled before
.BR putbq (9),
execution of the service procedure will occur after the current service procedure exists.
.PP
Although
.BI canput( q->q_next )
is functionally equivalent to
.BI canputnext( q ),
for the
.BR canput (9)
form, the dereference of the
.I q_next
pointer is not protected on some implementations of
.I STREAMS
for MP architectures: on which
.I q_next
may change as a result of a
concurrent reconfiguration of the
Stream
(e.g. an
.BR I_PUSH " or " I_POP
.BR streamio (7)
operation).
For MP operation,
portable
.I STREAMS
modules and drivers will always call
.BR canputnext (9)
instead of
.BI canput( q->q_next ).
.PP
For maximum portability and compatibility,
.BI canput( q->q_next )
under
.B "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
is always MP-safe from a module procedure or callout, or synchronous callback function that was
passed
.IR q ,
or the queue pair containing
.IR q .
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
It is the responsibility of a
.I STREAMS
driver putting a band zero (0)
.I normal
message to a message queue to check for flow control using
.BR canput ()
before placing a message on the queue with
.BR put (9)
or
.BR putq (9).
.PP
.BR canputnext (9)
and
.BR bcanputnext (9)
will always be used instead of
.BI canput( q->q_next )
or
.BI bcanput( q->q_next )
on multiprocessor (MP) systems.
.PP
.BR canput ()
and
.BR canputnext (9)
are the equivalent of
.BR bcanput (9)
and
.BR bcanputnext (9)
with a zero
.IR band :
and are implemented as such.
.PP
Note that the is some conflict in the documentation as to what happens when
.BR canput ()
hits the queue at end of the Stream
.RI ( q->q_next
is
.BR NULL )
and the queue has no service procedure.  Some implementations, notably
.IR UnixWare \(rg,
.[
uw7doc
.]
say
.BR canput ()
always returns
.IR true
.RB ( 1 )
in this situation.
The
.IR "SVR 4 SPG"
.[
svr4spg
.]
stays that
.BR canput ()
searches for the a queue with a service procedure or which has no forward queue and then peforms the
actions.  This also consistent with
.IR Solaris \(rg
.[
solspg
.]
behaviour.
The
.IR "SVR 4 SPG" ,
.[
svr4spg
.]
however, also says that if a
.IR qi_putp (9)
put procedure places a message onto its own queue with
.BR putq (9),
that it requires a
.IR qi_srvp (9)
service procedure.
One would not then expect a queue without a service procedure to have anything but an empty message
queue, and in that case,
.BR canput ()
can be expected to always return
.I true
.RB ( 1 )
for it.
.PP
.B "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
performs the actions on the queue at the end of the Stream when it is reached regardless of whether
it has a
.IR qi_srvp (9)
service procedure or not.  This is consistent with the description in the
.IR "SVR 4 SPG"
.[
svr4spg
.]
as well as
.IR Solaris \(rg
behaviour.
If such a queue's
.IR qi_putp (9)
put procedure never places message on the queue with
.BR putq (9),
there will be no difference in the values returned to
.BR canput ();
if the put procedure does place messages with
.BR putq (9),
without a service procedure,
.BR canput ()
will act as expected by the description in the
.IR "SVR 4 SPG" .

.PP
Above, the example uses
.BR canput ()
from the lower queue
.IR qi_putp (9)
procedure (in a multiplexing driver) to test the upper queue for flow
control.  If the upper queue is flow controlled, the message is placed on the lower queue.
Otherwise, if the lower queue is empty and the upper queue is not flow controlled, the example
places the message directly on the upper queue.
.PP
Note that the upper queue must have a service procedure.

states that
.BR canput ()
will not search forward in the
Stream
and that
.I q
must have a
.IR qi_srvp (9)
service procedure.  This is inconsistent with the
.IR "SVR 4 SPG" .
.[

Typically, however, only a driver
.RI ( "Stream end" )
will use
.BR canput (),
and then only to test its own queue.  If its own queue does not have a
.IR qi_srvp (9)
service procedure,
.BR canputnext (9)
is more appropriate.  Some efficiencies can be taken in using
.BR canput ()
from interrupt service routines if this stance is taken.
Strangely enough,
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg
does not document
.[

.BR bcanput (9)
in this fashion.

.BR canput ()
and
.BR bcanput (9)
under
.B "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
imposes a similar restriction for MP-safety when called from outside of
.I STREAMS
syncrhonous context; however,
.BR canput ()
and
.BR bcanput (9)
can always be called from a the driver
.IR qi_putp (9)
put procedure, even if the queue does not have a
.IR qi_srvp (9)
service procedure.
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will only call
.BR canput ()
for testing a driver
.RI ( "Stream end" )
read queue that contains a
.IR qi_srvp (9)
service procedure.
.IP \(em
All versions of
.I LiS
contain the bug that they keep track of message queue counts,
.IR q_count ,
.IR qb_count ,
in terms of the sum of the absolute sizes of the data buffers referenced by message blocks,
.RB ( "db_lim - db_base" ),
and not the sizes of the message blocks themselves,
.RB ( "b_wptr - b_rptr" ),
which does not conform to
.IR "SVR 4.2 STREAMS" .
