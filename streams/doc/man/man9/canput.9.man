.TH CANPUT 9 "$Date: 2005/01/21 10:09:50 $" "$Name:  $" "Linux Fast-STREAMS DDI/DKI"
.\"
.\"
.SH NAME
.B canput
\- test flow control on a message queue
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "int canput(queue_t *" q );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I q
the queue to check for flow control.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR canput ()
checks whether the stream is flow controlled starting at the
specified queue,
.IR q .
.BR canput ()
looks for the next queue which has a service routine or which has no
next queue.
.PP
If the next queue has the
.B QFULL
flag is clear indicating that the queue is not full, then
.BR canput ()
will return true (1).
.PP
If the next queue has the the
.B QFULL
flag is set indicating that the queue is full,
then
.BR canput ()
will return false (0).
.PP
When
.BR canput ()
returns false (0), it also sets the
.B QWANTW
flag for the queue upon which
.BR canput ()
stopped, indicating that the
.I STREAMS
scheduler should back-enable
service procedures when the flow controlled queue is
no longer full.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR canput ()
returns false (0) when the specified
.I STREAMS
message queue is flow controlled
and returns true (1) when the specified
.I STREAMS
message queue is not flow
controlled.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR canput ()
always succeeds for a valid
.IR q .
If
.I q
is invalid, the result is undefined.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR canput ()
can be called from any context.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR canput ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
It is the responsibility of a
.I STREAMS
module putting a band zero (0)
non-priority message to a message queue to check for flow control using
.BR canput ()
before placing a message on the queue with
.BR putq (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR canput ()
uses atomic bit operations and does not require locking of the queue
structure.  Therefore,
.BR canput ()
can be called for a
.I q
that is frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
.BR canput ()
is normally called before a call to
.BR putq (9)
as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
void
example_putp(queue_t *q, mblk_t *mp)
{
	priv_t p = (priv_t *)q->q_ptr;
	queue_t *uq = p->upper_queue;
	if (!q->q_count && (mp->b_datap->db_type >= QPCTL
		            || canput(uq))) {
		/* put to upper if we are empty and
		   upper is not flow controlled */
		putq(uq, mp);
	} else {
		/* put to our own queue otherwise */
		putq(q, mp);
	}
}
\s+1\fR
.fi
.PP
Above, the example uses
.BR canput ()
from the lower queue put procedure to test the upper queue for flow control.
If the upper queue is flow controlled, the message is placed on the lower
queue.  Otherwise, if the lower queue is empty and the upper queue is not flow
controlled, the example places the message directly on the upper queue.

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR canput ()
has no known bugs.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR canput ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4.2" ,
.[
svr42
.]
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR canput ()
called with a
.B NULL
or invalid
.I q
pointer will have undefined results and may crash or destabilize the kernel.
Under LiS, if
.BR canput ()
suffers an internal error,
.I q
is
.BR NULL ,
or points to a structure other than a
.B queue_t 
structure,
it will return false (0).
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules will not pass
.B NULL
or invalid arguments to
.I STREAMS
functions.
.IP \(em
Although a call to
.BI bcanput( q ", " 0 )
is functionally equivalent to
.BI canput( q ),
.BR canput ()
is implemented separately from
.BR bcanput ()
for speed.
LiS implements
.BI canput( q ),
.BI canputnext( q )
and
.BI bcanputnext( q ", " band )
with macros that call
.BI bcanput( q ", " band ).
.IP \(em
.BR canput ()
may be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).

do not permit
.BR canput ()
to be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
Portable
.I STREAMS

.BR canput ()
on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
