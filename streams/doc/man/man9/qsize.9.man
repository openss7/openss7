.SH NAME
.B qsize
\- return the number of messages on a queue
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "int qsize(queue_t *" q );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
a pointer to the queue for which to return the count of the number of
messages.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR qsize ()
returns the number of messages in the queue pointed to by
.IR q .
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR qsize ()
returns the number of messages in the queue pointed to by
.IR q .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR qsize ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR qsize ()
can be called from any context.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR qsize ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
implements
.BR qsize ()
by keeping a count of the number of messages on a queue in the
.BR queue_t
structure.  This permits faster performance for protocols that require message
counts as well as data byte counts.
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR freezestr (9),
.BR strqget (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR qsize ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR qsize ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and implementations based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
maintains a count of the messages on a given queue or queue band in the
.BR queue_t (9)
structure.  Therefore, the messages do not need to be counted when
.BR qsize ()
is called.
.IP ""
Under LiS,
.BR qsize ()
must lock the queue and walk the buffer chains counting the number of messages
on the queue for each invocation.  LiS is inefficient if many calls to
.BR qsize ()
are performed by a given
.I STREAMS
module or driver.
.IP \(em
.BR qsize ()
always succeeds.  LiS returns zero (0) on failure.
.IP \(em
.BR qsize ()
called with an invalid
.I q
pointer can panic the system.
Under LiS,
.BR qsize ()
called with an invalid
.I q
pointer will return zero (0).
.IP \(em
.BR qsize ()
may be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
.IR Solaris \(rg,
.[
solspg
.]
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg
.[
suxspg
.]
and
.IR UnixWare \(rg
.[
uw7spg
.]
do not permit
.BR qsize ()
to be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules should not call
.BR qsize ()
on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.IP \(em
Symbol
.BR lis_qsize ()
is provided for compatibility with
.IR LiS .
See
.BR liscompat (9).
.BR lis_qsize ()
simply calls
.BR qsize ()
directly.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.
