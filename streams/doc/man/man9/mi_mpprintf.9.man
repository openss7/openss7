.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR xxx ()
is a
.IR MPS \(rg-specific
function:
.B _MPS_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MPS
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MPS_MODULE
defined.

.SH BUGS

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR xxx ()
is compatible with
.IR MPS \(rg
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.IP \(em
.IP \(em
.BR xxx ()
is an
.IR MPS \(rg-specific
function and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
The more common
.BR zzz ()
function should be used in its stead.
.IP \(em
.BR xxx ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR MPS \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR MPS \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR MPS \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR xxx ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR MPS \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR xxx ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR mpscompat (9)

.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
