.PP
The
.B copyreq
structure is one of a set of
.BR ioctypes (9)
structures including
.BR iocblk (9),
.BR copyreq (9),
and
.BR copyresp (9),
that are used for communicating between the
Stream head
or an internal driver or module using
.I STREAMS
messages.  The messages used and the placement of these structures into messages is illustrated in
the table below:

.\" -----------
.PP
The
.BR M_COPYIN (9)
or
.BR M_COPYOUT (9)
message is sent upstream to the
Stream head
from a driver or module actively processing a received
.I transparent
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
message, requesting the
Stream head
to perform a
.BR copyin (9)
or
.BR copyout (9)
operation with the user.
.\" -----------
.PP
While running the module's
.IR qi_putp (9)
or
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure, there is no user context present against which to perform a
.BR copyin (9)
or
.BR copyout (9)
operation.  The
.BR M_COPYIN (9)
or
.BR M_COPYOUT (9)
message is used to request that the
Stream head,
executing in user context, perform the
.BR copyin (9)
or
.BR copyout (9)
operation on the module's behalf and report the results in an
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)
message passed back downstream.
.\" -----------
.PP
The
.I cq_cmd
field contains the input-output control command number that was originally passed by the
Stream head
to the responding module in the
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
message.  This is also the
.I command
argument to the
.BR ioctl (2s)
call invoked by user.
.\" -----------
.PP
The
.I cq_cr
field contains a pointer to the user credential that was originally passed by the
Stream head
to the responding module in the
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
message.  These are the credentials of the user that initiated the
.BR ioctl (2s)
call and began the transaction.
.PP
The
.B cq_uid
and
.BR cq_gid ,
macros are for backwards compatibility with
.IR "SVR 3.2" .
Under
.IR "SVR 3.2" ,
these were adjacent members of type
.B ushort
and occupied the same space as the
.I cq_cr
pointer.
Under
.IR "SVR 4"
these became macros with the same name as the old members.
.\" -----------
.TP \w'cq_private\(em'u
.I cq_id
The
.I cq_id
field is the unique input-output control identification number that was originally passed by the
Stream head
to the responding module in the
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
message.
Most
.I STREAMS
implementations only allow one input-output control to be active at a time.  However, an
input-output control may be abandonned by the
Stream head
if a response is not forthcoming within a time interval.  In that case, another input-output control
may have been invoked.  This subsequent input-output control will have a different identifier.  By
tracking the identifier, the
Stream head
or
Stream end
can determine if requests, response or acknoweldgements belong to the same transaction.
.\" -----------
.TP
.I cq_flags
The
.I cq_flags
field contains implementation specific flags.
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
neither defines nor recognizes any flags.  It also does not alter the flags field in any structure.
This field can be used by drivers and modules to pass limited state information.
.\" -----------
.TP
.I cq_addr
The
.I cq_addr
field is populated by the responding module and contains the address from or to which the responding
module is requesting a
.BR copyin (9)
or
.BR copyout (9)
operation.  This field will be overwritten in the
Stream head
response with the
.I cp_rval
member of the
.BR copyresp (9)
structure in the
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)
message.
Therefore, if the reponding module requires the address for further processing after the
Stream head
responds, it should be stored in the state information associated with
.IR cq_private .
.\" -----------
.TP
.I cq_size
The
.I cq_size
field is populated by the responding module and contains the number of bytes the responding module
is requesting by copied in a
.BR copyin (9)
or
.BR copyout (9)
operation.
This field is not guaranteed preserved in the
Stream head
response as there is no corresponding member in the
.BR copyresp (9)
structure of the
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)
message.
Therefore, if the responding module requires the count for further processing after the
Stream head
responds, it should be stored in the state information associated with
.IR cq_private .
This filed aligns with the
.I ioc_count
field of the
.BR iocblk (9)
structure significant in the
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
and
.BR M_IOCACK (9)
messages.
.\" -----------
.TP
.I cq_private
The
.I cq_private
field can be used by the responding module to store a state value or pointer to an area where the
state is maintained.  The value stored in the
.I cq_private
field is preserved to the
.I cp_private
field of the
.BR copyresp (9)
structure contained in the
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)
message sent by the
Stream head
to report the result of the action.  Any value stored here will be preserved: it does not have to be
a pointer to an
.BR mblk_t (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The alignment of the
.B copyreq
structure with the
.BR iocblk (9)
and
.BR copyresp (9)
structures is tuned for transforming, in place, one structure into another, and one
input-output control related
.I STREAMS
message type into another, without the need to free and allocate message blocks.
.PP
The
.BR iocblk (9)
structure in a received
.I tranparent
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
message is tranformed into a
.B copyreq
structure for a responding
.BR M_COPYIN (9)
message.
The
Stream head
transforms the
.B copyreq
structure in the
.BR M_COPYIN (9)
message into a
.BR copyresp (9)
structure for a reporting
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)
message.
The responding module may then transform the
.BR copyresp (9)
structure in the
Stream head's
reporting
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)
message into another
.B copyreq
structure for an
.BR M_COPYOUT (9)
message.

The responding module generates a
.B copyreq

.B iocblk (9)
structure contained in a
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
message, or a
.B copyresp (9)
structure contained in a
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)

.SH CONTEXT
.PP
Functions that operate on the
.B copyreq
structure can be called from any context.  However, it is the caller's responsibility to ensure that
the calling thread has exclusive access to the
copy request structure.
When the
copy request structure
is contained in an
.BR M_COPYIN (9)
or
.BR M_COPYOUT (9)
transformed from an
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
or
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)
message that has just been removed from a
.BR queue (9)
in a
.IR qi_putp (9)
or
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure of the queue,
copy request structure
exclusivity is normally guaranteed.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
Functions that access the
.B copyreq
structure are MP-safe.  However, it is the caller's responsibility to ensure exclusive access to the
structure before altering any of the members of the structure.
.PP
Because the copy request structure is normally stored in a
.I STREAMS
message, see
.BR datab (9)
for additional information.
