.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR mi_open_detached ()
creates an instance data structure and chains it into the list of driver or module instances.
In contrast to
.BR mi_open_comm (9),
.BR mi_open_detached ()
does not require an existing stream or module instance (queue) with which to associate the instance
data.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR mi_open_detached ()
is typically called by drivers or modules that need to access a driver or module's instance data
before the stream is created.  When the driver or module's
.IR qi_qopen (9)
procedure is later called, this instance can be used as the new queue's instance data by associating
it with the queue using
.BR mi_attach (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.BR mi_open_detached ()
succeeds, it returns a pointer to the newly created driver or module instance data;
when it fails, it returns
.BR NULL .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR mi_open_detached ()
fails, it returns
.BR NULL .
.BR mi_open_detached ()
fails when it cannot allocate memory for driver or module instance data.

.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR mi_open_detached ()
is a
.IR MacOT \(rg-specific
function:
.B _MAC_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC_MODULE
defined.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR mi_open_detached ()
is compatible with
.IR MacOT \(rg
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.IP \(em
.IP \(em
.BR mi_open_detached ()
is an
.IR MacOT \(rg-specific
function and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
The more common memory allocation functions
should be used in its stead.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_open_detached ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR MacOT \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR MacOT \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR MacOT \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_open_detached ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR MacOT \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR mi_open_detached ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.

See
.BR maccompat (9)
and
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
