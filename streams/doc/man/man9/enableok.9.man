.\"
.\"
.SH NAME
.B enableok
\- allows a \fISTREAMS\fP message queue to be scheduled
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "void enableok(queue_t *" q );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the queue upon which to permit enabling.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS .
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR enableok ()
clears the
.B QNOENB
flag on the specified queue,
.IR q .
This tells the
.I STREAMS
scheduler that the queue,
.IR q ,
can be scheduled for
.BR runqueues (9).
.PP
.BR enableok ()
is typically used to re-enable a queue after it has been disabled with
.BR noenable (9).
.PP
If
.BR enableok ()
has been called for a queue and
.BR noenable (9)
has not subsequently been called for the same queue a second call to
.BR enableok ()
will have no effect.
.PP
Queues that have their
.B QNOENB
flag clear will enable the
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure under all normal queue enabling
situations, as follows:
.IP \- \w'\-\(em'u
the queue is explicity enabled with
.BR qenable (9);
.PD 0
.IP \-
the queue is back-enabled;
.IP \-
an arriving message becomes the first message on the queue;
.IP \-
a message arrives and the
.B QWANTR
flag is set.
.PD
.PP
See also
.BR noenable (9).
.PP
Note that
.BR enableok ()
does not schedule the queue's
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure regardless of the state of the queue: it simply clears the
.B QNOENB
flag.  It takes further actions (as listed above) to cause the queue's
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure to be scheduled.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR enableok ()
can be used in conjunction with
.BR noenable (9)
to temporarily suspend queue
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure processing for a queue for
normal priority messages.
.BR noenable (9)
permits data messages to be enqueued without invoking the queue's
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedure.  A call to
.BR enableok ()
will then reverse the situation and restore normal queue scheduling.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR enableok ()
clears the
.B QNOENB
flag and returns void.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR enableok ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR enableok ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures,
callouts, callbacks, soft interrupts and interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR enableok ()
is MP-safe.
No global locks need to be held across the call to
.BR enableok ().
.BR enableok ()
takes a recursive freeze lock that can be acquired by the caller when the
Stream
is frozen.
If another thread has the
Stream
frozen with
.BR freezestr (9),
the calling processor will spin until the
Stream
is thawed by
.BR unfreezestr (9).
If one thread enables a queue with
.BR enableok ()
and another disables the queue with
.BR noenable (9),
there will be a race condition on the
.B QNOENB
flag.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR enableok ()
does not place the queue on the current
.BR runqueues (9)
schedule list.  It only clears the
.B QNOENB
flag to indicate whether the queue should be subsequently scheduled.  To add a
queue to the current run list, use
.BR qenable (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
.BR enableok (9)
can be used to re-enable a queue after a call to
.BR noenable (9).
The following
.BR qrestart ()
function will restart a disabled queue:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-2\
void qrestart(queue_t *q)
{
	enableok(q);
	if (q->q_first)
		qenable(q);
}
\s+2\fP
.fi
.PP
Note that
.BR enableok ()
does not place the queue on the
.BR runqueues ()
list.  It takes
.BR qenable (9)
to do that.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR enableok ()
is source-level compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,
.[
usldk
.]
and systems based on
.IR "SVR 4" ,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.BR enableok ()
may be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9),
but it is not recommended.
.BR enableok ()
uses atomic bit operations and uses a recursive freeze lock permitting it to be called while the
Stream
is frozen with
.BR freezestr (9)
by the caller.
.IP ""
.IR SUPER-UX \(rg
and
.IR UnixWare \(rg
do not permit
.BR enableok ()
to be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.[
suxspg
.]
.[
uw7spg
.]
.IR Solaris \(rg
.[
solspg
.]
permits
.BR enableok ()
to be called on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
Under
.IR LiS ,
.[
lis
.]
.BR enableok ()
takes the queue spin lock and uses normal bit operations to set the flag.
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
modules and drivers will not invoke
.BR enableok ()
on a stream that has previously been frozen with
.BR freezestr (9).
.RB ( "@PACKAGE_TITLE@"
.[
lfs
.]
includes an assertion to enforce this in the SMP environment.)
.IP \(em
.BR enableok ()
called with an invalid
.I q
argument will have an undefined result.
In referenced versions of
.I LiS
.[
LiS
.]
the result is undefined in the same situations due to an
.I LiS
coding error.  Repaired versions of
.I LiS
will make
.BR enableok ()
fail silently in these situations, which is largely unacceptable because it masks errors.
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
modules and drivers will not invoke
.BR enableok ()
with an invalid
.I q
argument.
Portable
.I STREAMS
modules and drivers will use
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
.[
lfs
.]
instead of
.IR LiS .
.IP \(em
.BR enableok ()
is not bug for bug compatible with
.IR LiS .
.IP ""
.I LiS
incorrectly schedules a queue that would have otherwise been enabled had
.BR nonenable (9)
not been in effect, whenever
.BR enableok ()
is called.  This is not consistent with
.I SVR 4
descriptions of treatment of the
.B QNOENB
flag and is an
.I LiS
bug.
.IP ""
Portable
.I STREAMS
modules and drivers will use
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
instead of
.IR LiS .
.IP \(em
Symbol
.BR lis_safe_enableok ()
is provided for compatibility with
.IR LiS .

.BR lis_safe_enableok ()
calls
.BR enableok ()
directly.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.
