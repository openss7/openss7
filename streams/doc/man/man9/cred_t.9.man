.SH DESCRIPTION

.SH NOTICES
.PP
Same layout as embedded in
.I Linux
.B task_struct
structure.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
The credentials structure really messes up binary compatibility with
.I LiS
.[
LiS
.]
because credentials pointers are passed to 
.BR qopen (9)
and
.BR qclose (9)
driver and module procedures.  Because of this,
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules that are registered with
.I Linux Fast-STREAMS
using the LiS compatible
.BR lis_register_strdev (9)
and
.BR lis_register_strmod (9)
LiS compatibility functions, will have
.B lis_cred_t
structure pointers passed instead.
