.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.IR qi_qclose ()
is one of 5 principal syncrhonous entry points into a
.I STREAMS
module or driver that form part of the definition of the module or driver.  The principal entry
points are:
.IR qi_qopen (9),
.IR qi_qclose (),
.IR qi_qadmin (9),
.IR qi_putp (9),
and
.IR qi_srvp (9).
.PP
The
.IR qi_qclose ()
routine is specified in the read queue
.BR qinit (9)
structure that is associated with an existing queue pair forming an instance of the module or driver
from the definitions in the module- and driver-defining
.BR streamtab (9)
structure.
.PP
The
.IR qi_qclose ()
routine is called by
.I STREAMS
before a queue pair forming an instance of the module or driver is removed from the Stream and
deallocated.  This routine permits the module or driver to perform whatever module or driver private
cleanup or deallocation is necessary before the queue pair is deactivated and removed from the
Stream.  Error numbers returned by this function are generally discarded.
.RB ( GNU/Linux
cannot return an error number to
.BR close (2s)
after the release operation has begun.)
.BR
All modules and drivers require a
.IR qi_qclose ()
routine to be defined.  See
.BR qinit (9).
.PP
Following are the arguments to the module or driver
.IR qi_qclose ()
routine:
.TP \w'oflag\(em'u
.I q
is a pointer to the read queue of an active queue pair forming an instance of the module or driver.
.TP
.I devp
is a pointer to the
.BR dev_t (9)
formatted device number.
.I devp
points to the device number of the driver in the Stream.
.TP
.I oflag
contains the current file flags (of the last closer) and will contain a bitwise OR of one or more of
the following flags:
.RS
.TP \w'FNDELAY\(em'u
.B FREAD
the
.I STREAMS
special file was opened for read.
.PD 0
.TP
.B FWRITE
the
.I STREAMS
special file was opened for write.
.TP
.B FEXCL
the
.I STREAMS
special file was opened for exclusive access.
.TP
.B FNDELAY
the
.I STREAMS
special file was opened for non-blocking operation.
.PD

.PP
.I STREAMS
invokes a module or driver
.IR qi_qclose ()
routine when the last
.BR close (2s),
.BR I_UNLINK (7),
.BR I_PUNLINK (7),
or
.BR fdetach (3),
operation causes the Stream to be dismantled.
.I STREAMS
also invokes the
.IR qi_qclose ()
routine of a module when popped from a Stream's module stack with the
.BR I_POP (7)
.BR ioctl (2s)
system call.
.PP
The
.IR qi_qclose ()
routine is called in the following circumstances:
.IP (1) \w'(0)\(em'u
The
.IR qi_qclose ()
routine of a module is invoked by a user executing a
.BR I_POP (7)
.BR ioctl (2s)
operation.
.IP (2)
The
.IR qi_qclose ()
routine of a module is invoked when the Stream is being dismantled and the module is on the Stream's
module stack.
.IP (3)
The
.IR qi_qclose ()
routine of a driver is invoked when the Stream is being dismantled.
.PP
Note that Streams are dismantled when a
.BR close (2s),
.BR I_UNLINK (7),
.BR I_PUNLINK (7),
or
.BR fdetach (3),
operation results in the release of the last reference to the Stream.
.PP
When the
.IR qi_qclose ()
routine is invoked by
.I STREAMS
for a queue pair, the following conditions prevail:
.IP (1) \w'(0)\(em'u
If the
.IR qi_qclose ()
routine is invoked as the last close of (release of the last reference to) a driver, the
.B STRCLOSE
bit will be set in the Stream head
.BR stdata (9)
structure, preventing all subsequent opens of the Stream, and the Stream will be removed from the
file pointer prior to the call to
.IR qi_qclose ().
.IP (2)
If the
.IR qi_qclose ()
routine is for a module
.BR I_POP (7)
operation, the
.B STRWOPEN
bit will be held in the Stream head
.BR stdata (9)
structure, preventing all other plumbing operations for the same Stream.
.IP (3)
The
.I q_ptr
members of each queue in the queue pair still point to module private data, or are preserved as
whatever the module or driver
.IR qi_qopen (9)
routine set for these private pointers.
.IP (4)
The queue pair will still be fully inserted into the Stream and queue procedures,
.IR qi_putp (9)
and
.IR qi_srvp (9),
will still be active.
It takes a call to
.BR qprocsoff (9)
from the
.IR qi_qclose ()
routine to disable
.IR qi_putp (9)
and
.IR qi_srvp (9)
procedures and half-delete the queue pair from the Stream.  The queue pair will be half-deleted by
.BR qprocsoff (9)
in the sense that the
.I q_next
pointers in the queue pair will still point to the Stream head and the top of the module stack or
driver, however, the
.I q_next
pointers of the Stream head and top of the module stack or driver will bypass the half-deleted queue
pair.
.IP (5)
The
.IR qi_qclose ()
procedure is called with a blockable, no locks held, user context: the user context being the user
that caused the routine to be invoked.  That is, the same user whose credentials are pointed to by
.IR crp .
The file flags for the user file descriptor associated with the call are contained in the
.I oflag
argument.  It is possible, in a non-portable way, to obtain a reference to the file pointer and
inode associated with the system call that invoked the routine.  This is always available in the
.I sd_file
and
.I sd_inode
members of the Stream head
.BR stdata (9)
structure.  The Stream head
.BR stdata (9)
structure can be located using the
.BR qstream (9)
macro.
.IP (6)
If an
.BR mp-streams (9)
synchronization specification has been made for the module or driver that include an inner
syncrhonization barrier,
.I STREAMS
enters the inner barrier shared or exclusive (according to the specification) before the
.IR qi_qclose ()
routine is called, and leaves the inner barrier after the call returns.

.SH USAGE
.PP
The following sections provide some guidelines for the design of
.IR qi_qclose ()
routines for a module or driver:
.\"
.SS Modules and Drivers
.PP
Following are some design guidelines for both module and driver
.IR qi_qclose ()
routines:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
Before detaching or deallocating resources required by a module or driver
.IR qi_putp (9),
.IR qi_srvp (9),
procedure or callback function, the
.IR qi_qclose ()
routine must call
.BR qprocsoff (9).
.IP \(bu
Before returning, the
.IR qi_qclose ()
routine must cancel all outstanding
.BR timeout (9)
and
.BR bufcall (9)
callbacks associated with the queue pair.
.IP \(bu
The module or driver is allowed to sleep in the
.IR qi_close ()
procedure, but must not sleep indefinitely.  When the routine sleeps awaiting arrival of a message
on a message queue, it should use
.BR qwait_sig (9)
or
.BR qwait (9).
.BR qwait_sig (9)
and
.BR qwait (9)
must be used before
.BR qprocsoff (9)
is called.
.IP \(bu
The
.IR qi_qclose ()
routine should deallocate any resources that were allocated as part of the
.IR qi_qopen (9)
routine, as well as any resources that where allocated while the module or driver was in operation.
.IP \(bu
.I q->q_ptr
and
.I WR(q)->q_ptr
should be
.B NULL
before returning from the routine.
.IP \(bu
All deallocations and cancellations must occur, regardless of the return value from the routine.
(The return value from the routine will be ignored by
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" .)
.\"
.SS Modules
Following are some design guidelines for module
.IR qi_qclose ()
routines:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
Modules must follow the general guidelines listed above under
.RI \*(lq "Modules and Drivers" \*(rq.
.IP \(bu
The
.I devp
argument points to the device number of the driver instance in the Stream from which the module is
being removed.
Altering this device number will have no effect.
.IP \(bu
The
.I oflag
argument contains the file flags for the file descriptor that is being used as an argument to the
.BR ioctl (2s)
system call invoked to
.BR I_POP (7)
the module, or was an argument to the call to the
.BR close (2s),
.BR I_UNLINK (7),
.BR I_PUNLINK (7),
or
.BR fdetach (3),
operation that resulted in dismantling of the Stream containing the module.
.BR 
.\"
.SS Drivers
Following are some design guidelines for driver
.IR qi_qclose ()
routines:
.IP \(bu \w'\(bu\(em'u
Drivers must follow the general guidelines listed above under
.RI \*(lq "Modules and Drivers" \*(rq.
.IP \(bu
The
.I devp
argument points to the device number of the driver instance which is being removed.
Altering this device number will have no effect.
.IP \(bu
The
.I oflag
argument contains the file flags for the file descriptor that is being used as an argument to the
.BR close (2s),
.BR I_UNLINK (7),
.BR I_PUNLINK (7),
or
.BR fdetach (3),
operation that resulted in dismantling of the Stream containing the driver.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
A module or driver
.IR qi_qclose ()
routines returns zero (0) for success, or a non-zero, positive (or negative), error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When a module or driver
.IR qi_qclose ()
routine fails, it returns a non-zero, positive (or negative), error number.
.PP
This error number is ignored by
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" .
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.IR qi_qclose ()
is only called by
.I STREAMS
in a blockable, no locks held, user context, with the
.BR STRWOPEN
or
.BR STRCLOSE
bit held in the Stream head private structure
.BR stdata (9),
(to prevent other simultaneous opens and closes of the same Stream).
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.\"
.SS Syncrhonized Modules and Drivers
.PP
If
.BR mp-streams (9)
syncrhonization has been specified for the module or driver, the inner syncrhonization barrier, if
any, is entered shared or exclusive per the synchronization specification for the module or driver,
across the call to the module or driver
.IR qi_qclose ()
routine.  If syncrhonization has not been specified for the module or driver (that is, the module or
driver is specified as MP-safe), the
.IR qi_qclose ()
routine is invoked without synchronization.
.\"
.SS MP-Safe Modules and Drivers
.PP
The discussion that follows applies to the MP-safe module or driver under
.BR "@PACKAGE_TITLE@" :
.PP
.IR qi_qclose ()
is only called by
.I STREAMS
in a blockable, no locks held, user context, with the
.BR STRWOPEN
or
.BR STRCLOSE
bit held in the Stream head private structure
.BR stdata (9),
(to prevent other simultaneous opens and closes of the same Stream).
.PP
Driver an module
.IR qi_qclose ()
routines are always invoked single-threaded and exclusive within a Stream (and with respect to
itself, and the
.IR qi_qopen (9)
routine) in accordance with description for
.IR "SVR 4" ,
.[
svr4spg
.]
as described in
.RI \*(lq "The Magic Garden Explained" \*(rq.
.[
magic

This is also consistent with exclusive open/close access under
.IR Solaris \(rg.

Only one
.I plumbing
.RB [ qopen (9),
.BR qclose (9),
.BR I_LINK (7),
.BR I_PLINK (7),
.BR I_UNLINK (7),
.BR I_PUNLINK (7),
.BR fattach (3),
.BR fdetach (3)]
operation at a time can be executing for a given Stream.  So, for example, data structures accessed
only by a
.I plumbing
operation, and which are private to a queue pair or Stream, do no need protective locks.
.PP
On the other hand, each
.IR qi_qclose ()
routine must be reentrant as it can run concurrent with any
.I plumbing
operation on a different Stream, for a different queue pair instance,
.IR q ,
of the same module or driver.
.PP
Unless
.BR mp-streams (9)
synchronization is used, a
.IR qi_qclose ()
routine can run concurrent with any
.IR qi_putp (9),
.IR qi_srvp (9),
or
synchronous or asynchronous callback functions for a separate instance of the module or driver.
Before
.BR qprocsoff (9)
has been called, 
.IR qi_putp (9),
.IR qi_srvp (9),
or
synchronous or asynchronous callback functions for the same instance of the module or driver may run
concurrent with the
.IR qi_qclose ()
routine.
Protective locks should be used on any data structures that a shared between the
.IR qi_qclose ()
routine and a different instance of a
.I plumbing
operation, or a different instance of a
.IR qi_putp (9),
.IR qi_srvp (9),
or callback procedure, or the same instance of a
.IR qi_putp (9),
.IR qi_srvp (9),
or callback procedure, before
.BR qprocsoff (9)
has been called.
