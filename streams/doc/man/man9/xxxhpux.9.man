.BR xxx ()
is a
.IR HP-UX \(rg-specific
function:
.B _HPUX_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with

.IP \(em
.BR xxx ()
is provided for source level compatibility with

for the purpose of porting

Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS

differ from that of

binaries are incompatible.

only provides functionality comparable to

Any and all functionality provided by
