.TH BCANPUTANY 9 "@PACKAGE_DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "@PACKAGE_TITLE@ DDI/DKI"
.\"
.\"
.SH NAME
.B bcanputany
\- check if message can be put to any (non-zero) band on a queue
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP
.B #include <sys/stream.h>
.HP
.BI "int bcanputany(queue_t *" q ");
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the
.BR queue (9)
to check.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
.IR STREAMS ,
implementation extension.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR bcanputany ()
finds the first forward
.BR queue (9)
from the specified queue,
.I q ,
that has a
.IR qi_srvp (9)
service procedure defined, or which has a
.B NULL
.I q_next
pointer.
.PP
For that queue, if the number of blocked queue bands,
.IR q_blocked ,
is less than the number of available queue bands,
.IR q_nband ,
then a message can be written to some non-zero message band.
.PP
When the number of blocked bands,
.IR q_blocked ,
is equal to the number of available bands,
.IR q_nband ,
and even if
.I q_nband
is zero, then there is no available non-zero message band that will accept messages.
Message bands to which no message have been written to at least once (i.e., do not have a
.BR qband (9)
structure) are not checked.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR bcanputany ()
is a variation of
.BR bcanputnextany (9)
that starts instead with the specified queue.
.BR bcanputany ()
is not used by the Stream head;
.BR bcanputnextany (9),
is.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When there exists an available, non-zero band, that is not flow controlled at or forward from the
queue,
.IR q ,
.BR bcanputany ()
returns true
.RB ( 1 );
otherwise, it returns false
.RB ( 0 ).
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR bcanputany ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR bcanputany ()
can be called from any context, including user context, module procedures, callouts, callbacks, soft
interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), and interrupt service routines.
.BR bcanputany ()
must be called from a synchronous context [see
.BR mp-streams (9)].
If
.BR bcanputany ()
is called from outside of
.IR STREAMS ,
or from across a multiplex,
.I q
must have a
.IR qi_srvp (9)
service procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR bcanputany ()
is MP-safe when called from the correct context.
.BR bcanputany ()
cannot be called from an asynchronous context, unless bracketed with
.BR freezestr (9)
and
.BR unfreezestr (9).
.PP
It is possible, due to race conditions in a multiprocessor (MP) system, that
.BR bcanputany ()
can be called for a queue and return true (1) and yet the Stream becomes flow controlled before a
call to
.BR putnext (9).
The caller to
.BR putnext (9).
is then in violation of flow-control rules; however, the extent of this violation is bounded.

.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR bcanputany ()
is not a standard
.I STREAMS
function, but it is exported for use by the Stream head,
.BR sth (4),
particularly when the Stream head is built as a separate kernel module.
