.TH GETMAJOR 9 "$Date: 2004/08/22 06:17:45 $" "$Name:  $" "Linux Fast-STREAMS DDI/DKI"
.\"
.\"
.SH NAME
.B getmajor
\- get the internal major device number for a device.
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <sys/streams.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/ddi.h>
.HP
.BI "major_t getmajor(dev_t " dev );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I dev
the device number from which to extract the internal major device number.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR getmajor (9),
.BR getminor (9)
and
.BR makedevice (9)
are the device handling functions defined in
.I SVR 4
.[
svr4
.]
that are normally used by
.I STREAMS
device drivers in the
.BR qopen (9)
procedure.
.PP
.BR getmajor ()
gets the internal (base) device major number associated with the external
.B dev_t
device number,
.IR dev .
.BR getmajor ()
is the normal architecture independent function call providing newer internal
and extended device numbering replacing the older
.I SVR 4
.[
svr4
.]
behaviour using a function of the same name.
.PP
.BR getmajor ()
is an architecture independent function that obtains the internal (base) major
device number associated with device
.IR dev .
.BR getemajor (9),
on the other hand, will return the external (real) major device number
associated with the device
.IR dev .
.BR major (9)
was the SVR 3
.[
svr3
.]
name for this function.
.BR major (3)
also exists as a user subroutine in
.BR <sys/sysmacros.h> .
.PP
.BR getmajor()
supports the concept of extended device numbering.  Under extended device
numbering, a device has a single internal (base) major device number and an
extended range of minor device numbers (exceeding 0 to 255).  Real device
numbers consist of a number of major device numbers visible to user
applications, and a range of minor device numbers associated with each major
device limited by the architecture (0 to 255 on
.BR "Linux 2.4" ).
.PP
Following is an example contrasting the mapping of external major and minor
device numbers to internal base major and extended minor device numbers:

.TE
.PP
.BR getmajor ()
is compatible with all device numbering schemes provided by
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS" .
For additional information on device numbering, see section
.RI \(lq "Device Numbering" \(rq,
in the
.BR "Linux Fast-STREAMS Programmer's Guide" ,
.BR SPG (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR getmajor ()
is used by drivers and modules that do not require knowledge of external major
device numbers and that wish to use a simplified approach to assignment of
minor device numbers for
.BR clone (4)
operations.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When successful,
.BR getmajor ()
returns the internal (base) major device number associated with device
.IR dev ;
when unsuccessful,
it returns
.BR NODEV .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR getmajor ()
fails, it returns
.BR NODEV .
.BR getmajor ()
fails when the passed in external device number,
.IR dev ,
has no corresponding internal major device number.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR getmajor ()
can be called from any context.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR getmajor ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
Depending on the architecture, the internal base major device number may or
may not be equal to one of the external (real) major device numbers assigned
to the driver.
.PP
Portable
.I STREAMS
drivers should neither rely upon the specific value returned by
.BR getmajor (),
nor should it hard code the range of minor device numbers available to the
major device number returned by
.BR getmajor ().
.PP
.B major_t
is
.BR "unsigned short" .
.PP
The current maximum range of extended minor device numbers is the range of
.B minor_t
which is
.B unsigned short
or a range of 0 to 65535.
.PP
Although the extended minor device range is currently from
0 to 65536,
only the first 1024 minor device numbers can be represented as external (real)
device numbers.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR getmajor ()
extracts the external (real) major device number from
.I dev
using
.BR getemajor (9),
and then converts this to an internal base major device number with
.BR etoimajor (9).

.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR getmajor ()
has no known bugs.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR getmajor ()
is compatible with
.IR "SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI" ,

and implementations based on

with the following portability considerations:

.IR Solaris \(rg
provides a somewhat different mechanism.  See

and

.IP \(em
.IR UnixWare "\(rg DDI8"
provides a different mechanism with registered driver resources and channel
numbers.
.IP \(em
.I LiS
.[
lis

does not support extended device numbering, and
.BR getmajor ()
on
.I LiS
reduces to
.BR getemajor (9).
.I LiS
version 2.17
is supposed to have some enhancements in this regard.
.IP \(em
.BR getmajor ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.I SVR 4.2 MP
and implementations based on
.I SVR 4.2
for the purpose of porting drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because the
.B dev_t
structure for
.B Linux
differs from that of other implementations,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR getmajor ()
only provide functionality comparable to
.I SVR 4.2 MP DDI/DKI
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.  Any and all functionality provided by
.BR getmajor ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices is not supported.
