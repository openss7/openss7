.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR ddi_get_pid ()
returns the process id of the current process.
.BR ddi_get_pid ()
is a SUNDDI specific function intended to replace
.BR drv_getparm (9).
Both are a system independent way for a
.I STREAMS
driver or module to obtain the process id of he current process.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR ddi_get_pid ()
returns the process id of the current process.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR ddi_get_pid ()
always succeeds.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR ddi_get_pid ()
is valid only when called from user context.  When called from another context
the process id returned is undefined.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR ddi_get_pid ()
is MP-safe.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR ddi_get_pid ()
is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function:
.B _SUN_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this
symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_SUN
set.
.PP
.BR ddi_get_pid ()
simply returns
.IR current->pid ,
which, when optimized will be inlined.
.\"
.\"
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
.BR drv_getparm (9),
.BR current (9).
.\"
.\"
.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR ddi_get_pid ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR ddi_get_pid ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR Solaris \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR Solaris \(rg
drivers to
.IR Linux \(rg.
Binary compatibility is not guaranteed.
