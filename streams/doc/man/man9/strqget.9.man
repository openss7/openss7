.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the queue for which to retrieve parameters.
.PD 0
.TP

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR strqget ()
returns the value or pointer requested by
.I what
for the queue pointed to by
.I q
and band specified by
.I band
into the memory area pointed to by
.IR val .
The attribute retrieved can be either a scalar or a pointer.
.PP
When
.I band
is zero,
.BR strqget ()
will retrieve the attribute specified by
.I what
for the queue.
When
.I band
is non-zero (between 1 and 255),
.BR strqget ()
will retrieve the attribute specified by
.I what
for the queue band specified by
.IR band .
.PP
The argument
.I what
specifies which queue (or queue band if
.I band
is non-zero) attribute is to be retrieved.
.I what
can be one of the following values:
.TP \w'\(emQMAXPSZ\(em'u
.B QHIWAT
Gets the high water mark associated with the
.PD 0
.I q
or queue
.IR band .
.TP
.B QLOWAT
Gets the low water mark associated with the
.I q
or queue
.IR band .
.TP
.B QCOUNT
Gets the count of bytes associated with the
.I q
or queue
.IR band .
.TP
.B QFIRST
Gets the first message pointer associated with the
.I q
or queue
.IR band .
.TP
.B QLAST
Gets the last message pointer associated with the

.I q
or queue
.IR band .
.TP \w'\(emQMAXPSZ\(em'u

For this operation
.I band
must be zero (0).
.TP
.B QMINPSZ
Gets the minimum packet size associated with the
.IR q .
For this operation
.I band
must be zero (0).

.BR strqget ()
are equivalent to directly accessing the
.B queue
or
.B qband
structure members described below.
.PP
The
.B queue
structure contains at least the following members:
.HP
.BI "ulong " q_hiwat
\- the high water mark for the queue.
.PD 0
.HP
.BI "ulong " q_lowat
\- the low water mark for the queue.
.HP
.BI "ulong " q_count
\- the count of the number of bytes in the queue.
.HP
.BI "struct msgb *" q_first
\- the first message in the queue.
.HP
.BI "struct msgb *" q_last
\- the last message in the queue.
.HP
.BI "ulong " q_flag
\- the flags associated with the queue, see
.BR "\*(lqQueue Flags\*(rq" ,
above.

.BI "long " q_maxpsz
\- the maximum message size accepted by the queue.
.HP
.BI "long " q_minpsz

.SH USAGE
.PP
.BR strqget ()
is the proper transparent and implementation independent method for accessing members of the
.BR queue (9)
and
.BR qband (9)
structures.
.PP
.BR strqget ()
will attempt to allocate a
.BR qband (9)
structure for bands that are accessed for which a
.BR qband (9)
structure does not yet exist.
This means that
.BR strqget ()
can be used to allocate queue bands so that subsequent calls to
.BR appq (9),
.BR insq (9),
.BR putq (9)
and
.BR putbq (9)
will not fail for the allocated band.
.PP
.BR strqget ()
can be called in a module or driver initialization routine to ensure that
.BR appq (9),
.BR insq (9),
.BR putq (9)
and
.BR putbq (9)
will never fail for the allocated queue band.  This is useful if
.BR appq (9),
.BR insq (9),
.BR putq (9)
or
.BR putbq (9)
are called from interrupt service routine context.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success,
.BR strqget ()
returns zero (0) and places the appropriate value in the
memory area pointed to by
.IR val .
.PP
Upon failure,
.BR strqget ()
returns a non-zero error number.
The memory area pointed to by
.I val
remains unchanged.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR strqget ()
fails,
it returns one of the following errors:
.TP \w'[ENOMEM]\(em'u
.RB [ EINVAL ]
The value pointer
.I val
is
.BR NULL ;
the queue pointer
.I q
is
.BR NULL;
.I q
does not point to a valid queue structure;
.BR QMAXPSZ " or " QMINPSZ
was specified for
.I what
and
.I band
was non-zero;
.I what
is not a valid queue or queue band attribute.
.TP
.RB [ ENOMEM ]
the queue band specified in
.I band
does not exist and a
.BR qband (9)
structure could not be immediately allocated.
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR strqget ()
can be called from any non-ISR context, including user context, module procedures, callouts,
callbacks, soft interrupts (tasklets and bottom halves), but excluding interrupt service routines.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR strqget ()
is MP-safe.
.PP
Calling
.BR strqget ()
on a queue and stream previously frozen with
.BR freezestr (9)
could result in single-party deadlock.
.\"
.\"
.\".SH NOTICES
.\".PP
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.BR strqget ()
uses recursive read-write locks on the stream head, so calls to
.BR strqget ()
on a stream frozen with
.BR freezestr (9)
will not result in single-party deadlock.  Also, failure to call
.BR freezestr (9)
on the stream will not cause
.BR strqget ()
to panic because the head lock is still taken.
