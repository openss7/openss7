.SH NAME
.B mi_copyout
\- copy data from a user buffer
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #define _MAC_SOURCE
.br
.B #include <sys/ddi.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/macddi.h>
.HP
.BI "void mi_copyout(queue_t *" q ", mblk_t *" mp );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I q
the current write-side queue whose put or service procedure within which
.BR mi_copyout ()
is being called.
.TP
.I mp
a pointer to the message block that contains the
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
or
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)
message being processed.  This is the message that was passed to the write-side put or service
procedure within which
.BR mi_copyout ()
is invoked.
.BR mi_copyout_alloc (9)
must be used to allocate the message blocks into which the data to be copied out is placed.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR mi_copyout ()
is one of a set of helper functions that support transparent input-output controls (see
.BR ioctl (2s)
and
.BR streamio (9))
that includes
.BR mi_copyin (9),
.BR mi_copyout (9),
.BR mi_copyout_alloc (9),
.BR mi_copy_done (9),
.BR MI_COPY_CASE (9),
.BR mi_copy_set_rval (9)
and
.BR mi_copy_state (9).
.PP
.BR mi_copyout ()
is used to copy data from the kernel to user-space.  When a module or driver put or service
procedure receives a
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
or
.BR M_IOCDATA (9)
message, and there is data to be copied out to user-space, the
.BR mi_copyout_alloc (9)
function is used to add data to the message pointed to by
.I mp
and then the
.BR mi_copyout ()
function is called to invoke the
.BR M_COPYOUT (9)
message upstream.
.PP
If called after the last copy in or copy out operation and no copy out allocations were generated
with
.BR mi_copyout_alloc (9)
or remain after previous
.BR mi_copyout ()
calls, then
.BR mi_copyout ()
will close the input output control operation as though
.BR mi_copy_done (9)
was called like:
\fBmi_copy_done\fR(\fIq\fR, \fImp\fR, \fIcp->cp_rval\fR).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
.BR mi_copyout ()
returns
.BR void .
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.BR mi_copyout ()
fails when passed invalid pointers.  When
.BR mi_copyout ()
fails, it panics the kernel.
.PP
If
.BR mi_copyout ()
suffers an internal failure, it will close the input output control operation with a suitable error
code.  The error codes returned by
.BR mi_copyout ()
to the
.BR ioctl (2s)
operation in
.BR errno (3),
are as follows:
.TP \w'ENOBUFS\ \ 'u
.B EPROTO
.BR mi_copyout ()
was passed an invalid argument, or the passed in message block was of an invalid format.
.TP
.B ENOSR
.BR mi_copyout (),
or the stream head, could not allocate a
.I STREAMS
resource
to complete the operation.
.TP
.B ENOMEM
.BR mi_copyout (),
or the stream head, could not allocate 
memory to
complete the operation.
.TP
.B ENOBUFS
.BR mi_copyout (),
or the stream head, could not allocate 
a buffer
to complete the operation.
.\"
.\"
.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
See
.BR mi_copyin (9)
and
.BR mi_copyout (9)
for examples of the usage of
.BR mi_copyout ().
.\"
.\"
.SH CONTEXT
.PP
.BR mi_copyout ()
can be called from any context; however, it is normally called from the
.I STREAMS
module or driver write-side queue put or service procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH MP-STREAMS
.PP
.BR mi_copyout ()
is MP-safe; however, it is the responsibility of the caller to ensure exclusive access to the passed
in message blocks.  This is normally the case when the function is called from the
.I STREAMS
module or driver write-side queue put or service procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
.BR mi_copyout ()
is a
.IR MacOT \(rg-specific
function:
.B _MAC_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
must also have been compiled with
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC
or
.B CONFIG_STREAMS_COMPAT_MAC_MODULE
defined.

.SH BUGS
.PP
.BR mi_copyout ()
has no known bugs.
.\"
.\"
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.BR mi_copyout ()
is compatible with
.IR MacOT \(rg
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
.IP \(em
.IP \(em
.BR mi_copyout ()
is an
.IR MacOT \(rg-specific
function and should not be used by portable
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
The more common message utility functions
should be used in its stead.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_copyout ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR MacOT \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR MacOT \(rg
drivers to
.BR Linux .
Because internal structures and definitions for
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS
.[
lfs
.]
differ from that of
.IR MacOT \(rg,
binaries are incompatible.
.IP \(em
.BR mi_copyout ()
only provides functionality comparable to
.IR MacOT \(rg
for use by
.I STREAMS
drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by
.BR mi_copyout ()
in support of
.RI non- STREAMS
devices are not supported.
.PP
See
.BR maccompat (9)
and
.BR STREAMS (9)
for additional compatibility considerations.
