is a
.IR Solaris \(rg-specific
function:
.B _SUN_SOURCE
must be defined before including DDI/DKI include files to expose this symbol.
.B Linux Fast-STREAMS

.IP \(em
.BR ddi_removing_power ()
is provided for source level compatibility with
.IR Solaris \(rg
for the purpose of porting
.IR Solaris \(rg
drivers to
.IR Linux \(rg.
Because internal structures and definitions for

drivers and modules.
Any and all functionality provided by

devices are not supported.
