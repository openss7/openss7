.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B strvf
command executes a series of subcommands that verify whether or not
.I STREAMS
is currently installed and configured on your system.  All output is sent to
.IR stdout .
Verbose output is always sent to the logfile
.BR /var/log/streams/strvf.log .
.\".BR /var/adm/streams/strvf.log .
.PP
These subcommands make sure that the
.I STREAMS
kernel daemons are running and that
.BR open (2),
.BR putmsg (2),
.BR getmsg (2),
.BR ioctl (2)
and
.BR close (2)
can be performed on
.BR /dev/echo .
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.TP
\fB-n\fR, \fB--nologging\fR
Suppress logging, send output to
.B stdout
and errors to
.BR stderr .
Default: off.
.TP
\fB-b\fR, \fB--basename\fR \fIBASENAME\fR
Only significant when logging.
Set the base name of logging and error files.  Default:
.RB \(lq strvf \(rq.
.TP
\fB-O\fR, \fB--directory\fR \fIDIRECTORY\fR
Only significant when logging.
Set the directory to which log and error files are written.  Default:
.RB \(lq /var/log/streams \(rq.
.TP
\fB-o\fR, \fB--outfile\fR \fIOUTFILE\fR
Only significant when logging.
Set the output file name for logging.  Default:
\(lq\fIBASENAME\fB.log\fR\(rq.
.TP
\fB-e\fR, \fB--errfile\fR \fIERRFILE\fR
Only significant when logging.
Set the output file name for errors.  Default:
\(lq\fIBASENAME\fB.err\fR\(rq.
.TP
\fB-D\fR, \fB--devname\fR \fIDEVNAME\fR
Only significant when logging.
Set the device name to perform test upon.  Default:
.RB \(lq /dev/echo \(rq.
.TP
\fB-q\fR, \fB--quiet\fR
Suppress normal output.
.TP
\fB-d\fR, \fB--debug\fR [\fIlevel\fR]
Increase, or specify the debugging of the output.
.TP
\fB-v\fR, \fB--verbose\fR [\fIlevel\fR]
Increase, or specify the verbosity of the output.
.TP
\fB-h\fR, \fB--help\fR
Print usage information and exit.
.TP
\fB-V\fR, \fB--version\fR
Print version information and exit.
.TP
\fB-C\fR, \fB--copying\fR
Print copying information and exit.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
.B strvf
returns a zero (0) exit status on success.  If
.B strvf
fails, it returns an exit status of one (1) and prints a diagnostic error
message to
.BR stderr .
.PP
An exit status of zero (0) indicates that
.B strvf
was successful; one (1) indicates that an error occured and diagnostic message
is printed on
.BR stderr ;
two (2) indicates that the option syntax was in error and a diagnostic message
is printed on
.BR stderr .
.PP
Errors may result from the failure of any of the test in the verification
procedure, failure to open the
.B /dev/echo
device, or inadequate permissions.
