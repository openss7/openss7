.SH NAME
.B t_sndv
\- gather and send data
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <xti.h>
.HP 8
.BI "int t_sndv(int " fd ", struct t_iovec *" iov ", unsigned int " iovcnt ", int " flags );
.\"
.\"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I fd
specifies the local transport endpoint from which the data is to be sent.
.TP
.I iov
is a pointer to an array of
.B t_iovec
structures that specify the scatter-gather buffer from which to gather the
data.
.TP
.I iovcnt
is the number of
.B t_iovec
structures in the array pointed to by
.IR iov .
.TP
.I flags
describe additional information about the data being sent.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR t_sndv ()
sends connection oriented data, gathering the data from a vector of
user specified scatter-gather buffers.
.PP
The
.I flags
are a bitwise OR of any of the following flags:
.TP
.B T_MORE
specifies that the next send operation will include data belonging to the same
transport service data unit or expedited transport service data unit.
.TP
.B T_EXPEDITED
specifies that the data is part of an expedited transport service data unit.
When not set, specifies that the data is part of a normal transport service
data unit.
.TP
.B T_PUSH
specifies that any accumulated data should be sent without delay.
.PP
The
.B t_iovec
structure is formatted as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
struct t_iovec {
        void *iov_base;
        size_t iov_len;
};
\fR\s+1
.fi
.PP
The
.B t_iovec
structure specifies the following members:
.TP
.I iov_base
The base of the scatter-gather buffer.
.TP
.I iov_len
The length of the scatter-gather buffer pointed to by
.IR iov_base .
.PP
When data is sent, each buffer in the array of scatter-gather buffers,
.IR iov ,
are used in order until they are exhausted and then data is sent from the next
sequential buffer in the array.
.\"
.\"
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
.BR t_sndv ()
is only valid in the
.BR T_DATAXFER " and " T_INREL
states.
.PP
.BR t_sndv ()
is only valid for transport service providers of service type
.BR T_COTS " and " T_COTS_ORD .
.PP
In synchronous mode,
.BR t_sndv ()
blocks until there is sufficient room to buffer the data for transmission
considering flow control.  In asynchronous mode where there is insufficient
room to buffer the data for transmission considering flow control,
.BR t_sndv ()
fails, returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to
.RB [ TFLOW ].
.PP
.BR t_sndv ()
is functionaly equivalent to
.BR writev (2),
and the two functions can be used interchangeably; however,
.BR writev (2)
does not maintain
.IR t_errno (3).
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon success,
.BR t_sndv ()
returns zero (0) or a positive integer reflecting the number of bytes sent.
Upon failure,
.BR t_sndv ()
returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR t_sndv ()
fails, it returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number as follows:
.TP \w'[TNOTSUPPORT]\(em'u
.RB [ TBADF ]
.I fd
is invalid.
.TP
.RB [ TBADFLAG ]
The argument
.I flags
contains invalid flags (other than
.BR T_MORE ", " T_EXPEDITED " or " T_PUSH ).
.TP
.RB [ TFLOW ]
The call would block due to flow control but
.I fd
is in asynchronous mode
.BR "" ( O_NONBLOCK " or " O_NDELAY
was set using
.BR t_open (3)
or
.BR fcntl (2).
.TP
.RB [ TLOOK ]
An asynchronous event occured before the call could complete.  See
.BR t_look (3)
for more information.
.TP
.RB [ TNOTSUPPORT ]
The call requires the use of a TPI primitive not supported by the underlying transport provider.
The can occur when the transport service provider is of service type
.BR T_CLTS .
.TP
.RB [ TOUTSTATE ]
The call was issued with the interface in a state other than
.BR T_DATAXFER " or " T_INREL .
.TP
.RB [ TPROTO ]
A protocol error occured between the XTI/TLI library and the underlying transport provider.
.TP
.RB [ TSYSERR ]
A
.B Linux
system error occured and the
.B Linux
error number is set in
.IR errno (3).

.SH "BUGS"
