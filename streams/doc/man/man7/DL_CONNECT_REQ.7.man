.TH DL_CONNECT_REQ 7 "$Date: 2004/03/01 02:44:06 $" "$Name:  $" "Linux Fast-STREAMS"
.SH NAME
.B DL_CONNECT_REQ (dl_connect_req_t)
\- requests the DLS provider establish a data link connection with a
remote DLS user.
.SH DISCONNECT
.B DL_CONNECT_REQ
requests the DLS provider establish a data link connection with a remote DLS
user.  The request contains the DLSAP address of the remote (called) DLS user
and quality of service parameters to be negotiated during connection
establishment.
.SH SYNOPSIS
The message consists of one
.B M_PROTO
message block containing the structure shown below.
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    t_uscalar_t  dl_primitive;
    t_uscalar_t  dl_dest_addr_length;
    t_uscalar_t  dl_dest_addr_offset;
    t_uscalar_t  dl_qos_length;
    t_uscalar_t  dl_qos_offset;
    t_uscalar_t  dl_growth;
} dl_connect_req_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP 12
.I dl_primitive
conveys
.BR DL_CONNECT_REQ .
.TP
.I dl_dest_addr_length
conveys the length of the DLSAP address that identifies the DLS user with whom
a connection is to be established.  If the called user is implemented using
DLPI, this address is the full DLSAP address returned on the
.BR DL_BIND_ACK (7).
.TP
.I dl_dest_addr_offset
conveys the offset from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
message block where the destination DLSAP address begins.
.TP
.I dl_qos_length
conveys the length of the quality of service (QOS) parameter values
desired by the DLS user initiating a connection.  The desired QOS values
are conveyed in the appropriate structure defined in
.IR "\*(lqQOS Data Structures" . \*(rq
A full specification of these QOS parameters and rules for
negotiating their values is presented in
.IR "\*(lqQuality of Data Link Service" . \*(rq
If the DLS user does not wish to specify a particular QOS value, the value
.B DL_QOS_DONT_CARE
may be specified.  If the DLS user does not care to specify any QOS parameter
values, this field may be set to zero.
.TP
.I dl_qos_offset
conveys the offset from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
message block where the quality of service parameters begin.
.TP
.I dl_growth
defines a growth field for future enhancements to this primitive.  Its
value must be set to zero.
.SH STATE
The message is valid in state
.BR DL_IDLE .
.SH "NEW STATE"
The resulting state is
.BR DL_OUTCON_PENDING .
.SH RESPONSE
There is no immediate response to the connect request.  However, if the
connect request is accepted by the called DLS user,
.BR DL_CONNECT_CON (7)
is sent to the calling DLS user, resulting in state
.BR DL_DATAXFER .
If the connect request is rejected by the called DLS user, the called DLS user
cannot be reached, or the DLS provider and/or called DLS user do not agree on
the specified quality of service, a
.BR DL_DISCONNECT_IND (7)
is sent to the calling DLS user, resulting in state
.BR DL_IDLE .
If the request is erroneous, message
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7)
is returned and the resulting state is unchanged.
.SH ERRORS
.TP 12
.B DL_ACCESS
The DLS user did not have proper permission to use the requested
DLSAP address.
.TP
.B DL_BADADDR
The destination DLSAP address was in an incorrect format or contained
invalid information.
.TP
.B DL_BADQOSPARAM
The quality of service parameters contained invalid values.
.TP
.B DL_BADQOSTYPE
The quality of service structure type was not supported by the DLS provider.
.TP
.B DL_OUTSTATE
The primitive was issued from an invalid state.
.TP
.B DL_SYSERR
A system error has occurred and the Linux system error is indicated in
the
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7).
