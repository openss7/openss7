.SH SYNOPSIS
This primitive consists of one
.B M_PCPROTO
message block structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {

    cd_ulong cd_errno;
    cd_ulong cd_explanation;
} cd_error_ack_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi

.SS State
This primitive is valid in any state where a local acknowledgment is pending
in response to one of the following primitives:
.BR CD_ABORT_OUTPUT_REQ (7),
.BR CD_ALLOW_INPUT_REQ (7),
.BR CD_ATTACH_REQ (7),
.BR CD_DETACH_REQ (7),
.BR CD_DISABLE_REQ (7),
.BR CD_ENABLE_REQ (7),
.BR CD_HALT_INPUT_REQ (7),

.BR CD_MUX_NAME_REQ (7),
.BR CD_READ_REQ (7),
.BR CD_UNITDATA_REQ (7),
.BR CD_WRITE_READ_REQ (7).
The new state remains unchanged from the state in which the request primitive
was issued that illicited the error acknowledgment.
