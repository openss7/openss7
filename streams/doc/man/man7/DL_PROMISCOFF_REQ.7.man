.SH NAME
.B DL_PROMISCOFF_REQ (dl_promiscoff_req_t)
\- this primitive requests the DLS Provider to disable promiscuous mode on a
per Stream basis, either at the physical level or at the SAP level.
.SH SYNOPSIS
The message consists of one
.B M_PROTO
message block, which contains the following structure.
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    t_uscalar_t  dl_primitive;
    t_uscalar_t  dl_level;
} dl_promiscoff_req_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
