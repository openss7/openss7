.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B I_PLINK
.BR ioctl (2s)
command links one Stream, with file descriptor
.IR arg ,
under the multiplexing driver of another Stream, with file descriptor
.IR fd .
.PP
.I fd
is the file descriptor of a Stream connected to a multiplexing driver, that was returned from the
.BR open (2s)
system call when the multiplexing driver was opened and the Stream created.  A multiplexing driver
is a
.I STREAMS
driver that has a lower multiplexer definition.  A lower multiplexer definition exists when the
.I st_muxrinit
and
.I st_muxwinit
members of the
.BR streamtab (9)
structure defining the driver are
.RB non- NULL .
.PP
.I arg
is the file descriptor of another Stream, that was returned from the
.BR open (2s)
or
.BR pipe (2s)
system call when the Stream was created.
In general, the Stream specified by
.I arg
can be any regular Stream,
.IR STREAMS -based
.BR pipe (4),
or
.IR STREAMS -based
.BR fifo (4),
but
.I arg
must be associated with a Stream.
.PP
.B I_PLINK
performs a persistent link of the Stream, specified by
.IR arg ,
beneath the multiplexing driver associated with
.IR fd .
Persistent links are not automatically dismantled when the control Stream,
.IR fd ,
is closed and remain after the last reference to the control Stream is otherwise relinquished.
Persistent links can only be removed with an explicit call to
.BR I_PUNLINK (7).
.PP
The
.B I_PLINK
operation will cause the Stream head to generate a
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
message with a
.BR M_DATA (9)
block containing a
.BR linkblk (9)
structure.  This
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
message is passed downstream to the multiplexing driver.  A positive
.BR M_IOCACK (9)
or negative
.BR M_IOCNAK (9)
acknowledgement is expected from the driver before the operation can complete.
.PP
The
.B I_PLINK
.BR ioctl (2s)
call will block waiting to acquire exclusive access to the Streams associated with
.I fd
and
.IR arg ,
awaiting allocation of the necessary internal
.I STREAMS
.BR linkblk (9)
and
.BR syncq (9)
data structures,
awaiting the allocation of an
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
message to pass downstream,
and
awaiting an acknowledgement from the driver.
.PP
The
.B I_PLINK
operation will fail if the call times out awaiting acknowledgement from the driver,
the call is interrupted by a signal,
or either the control Stream,
.IR fd ,
or the linked Stream,
.IR arg ,
receives a hangup
.BR M_HANGUP (9)
or an asynchronous error
.BR M_ERROR (9)
message before the call can complete.
.PP
When successful, the operation completes and a system-wide unique multiplex link indentifier is
returned.  This value can subsequently be used as an argument to an
.BR I_PUNLINK (7)
operation, to unlink the linked Stream.
.PP
.I STREAMS
records the fact that this link is a persistent link.  Even though the returned multiplex link identifier
is system-wide unique, a call to
.BR I_UNLINK (7)
with a multiplex identifier returned from an
.I I_PLINK
operation will fail and return
.RB [ EINVAL ].
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
.B I_PLINK
is used to form a persistent link between a multiplexing driver and another Stream.  Persistent links
are not associated with the control Stream (specified by
.IR fd ).
When the control Stream is closed and the last reference to the Stream relinquished, persistent
links will remain intact.
.PP
It is not necessary to keep a persistently linked Stream open for it to remain linked.  When the
Stream is unlinked with
.B I_PUNLINK (7),
the Stream will be unlinked and the reference to the Stream released causing the previously linked
Stream to be dismantled.
.PP
The control Stream itself can be later linked underneath another multiplexing driver.  In this
manner, complex trees of multiplexed Streams can be created.  However, if persistent links are used
throughout, all control Streams can be closed and the configuration will remain intact.
.PP
In contrast, the
.BR I_LINK (7)
.BR ioctl (2s)
causes a Stream to be regularly (non-persistently) linked under a multiplexing driver.
.PP
Persistent links are typically used for system initialization without the need for a daemon process.
When the system boots, initialization scripts create the multiplex and then close all file descriptors
associated with the Streams involved.  The multiplex configuration persists for the life of the
system, or until explicitly dismantled or reconfigured.
.PP
In contrast, regular links created with
.BR I_LINK (7)
require the existence of a daemon process to maintain the multiplex by holding a control Stream
open.
See
.BR I_LINK (7).
.PP
Because of the power of persistent links, most multiplexing driver designs require that the caller
have adequate privilege to form a persistent link.  The credentials of the caller are passed to the
driver in the
.BR M_IOCTL (9)
message requesting formation of a persistent link.  The driver will typically deny formation of a
persistent link unless the caller has root privilege.  If the passed credentials reveal that the
caller does not have adequate privilege, the driver normally responds with a
.BR M_IOCNAK (9)
message containing the
.RB [ EPERM ]
error number.
.\"
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon success, the
.B I_PLINK
.BR ioctl (2s)
command returns a positive integer.
Upon failure, the
.B I_PLINK
.BR ioctl (2s)
command returns minus one
.RB ( -1 )
and sets
.IR errno (3)
to an appropriate error number.
.PP
When successful,
.B I_PLINK
returns a positive integer representing the multiplex identifier of the linked Stream.  This value
can subsequently be used in a
.BR I_PUNLINK (7)
command.

.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
The
.I "SVR 4.2 SPG"
.[
svr42spg
.]
indicates that
.I STREAMS
keeps track of linked Streams and detects when a loop could occur in a given multiplex arrangement,
and that
.RB [ EINVAL ]
can be returned when a possible looping configuration is detected.
.RS
.ll -7n
.PP
\(lqThe construction of cycles is not allowed when creating links.  A cycle could be constructued by
creating a persistent link of multiplexer 2 below multiplexer 1 and then closing the controlling
file descriptor associated with the multiplexer 2 and reopening it again and then linking the
multiplexer 1 below the multiplexer 2.  This is not allowed.  The operating system prevents a
multiplexer configuration from containing a cycle to ensure that messages cannot be routed
infinitely, thus creating an infinite loop or overflowing the kernel stack.\(rq

.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
does not detect such arrangements, because, for the most part, they can represent valid
configurations.  This is likely, however, a security issue, particularly if a looping arrangement
can be built by an unprivileged user.
.PP
Because persistent links typically require root privilege, this is not such an issue for persistent
links as it is for regular links.

Note that at line 6, a different Stream to the multiplexing driver was opened to remove the
persistent link as was opened at line 8 in the previous listing.  The persistently linked Stream is
still unlinked, regardless of the control Stream used.

Instead of using
