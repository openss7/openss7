.SH NAME
.B CD_OK_ACK
\- success acknowledgment
.SH SYNOPSIS
This primitive consists of one
.B M_PCPROTO
message block structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    cd_ulong cd_primitive;
    cd_ulong cd_state;
    cd_ulong cd_correct_primitive;
} cd_ok_ack_t;
\fR\s+1

.I cd_state
Indicates the new state of the CD provider following sucessful processing of
the request message that illicited the
.BR CD_OK_ACK .
.RS
.TP
.B CD_UNATTACHED
No PPA attached.
.TP
.B CD_UNUSABLE
PPA cannot be used.
.TP

.B CD_XRAY
Xray-ing another ppa.
.RE
.TP
.I cd_correct_primitive
Indicates the primitive that was successfully received.
.I cd_error_primitive
can be one of the following values:
.RS

.SS State
This primitive is valid in any state where an local acknowledgement is pending
and the primitive is required by the request primitive.  The new state is the
state described under the corresponding request primitive.
