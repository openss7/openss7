\section[Background]{Background}

Pipes have a rich history in the UNIX operating system.  Present on early Bell Laboratories UNIX
Versions, pipes found their way into both BSD and System V releases.  Finally, in 4.4BSD pipes are
implemented with Sockets and in System V Release 4 pipes are implemented with STREAMS.

\subsection[STREAMS]{STREAMS}

STREAMS is a facility first presented in a paper by Dennis M. Ritchie in 1984 \cite[]{Ritchie84},
originally implemented on 4.1BSD and later part of \textsl{Bell Laboratories Eighth and Ninth Edition UNIX},
incorporated into \textsl{UNIX System V Release 3} and enhanced in \textsl{UNIX System V Release 4}
and further in \textsl{UNIX System V Release 4.2}.  STREAMS was used in SVR4 for terminal
input-output, pseudo-terminals, pipes, named pipes (FIFOs), interprocess communication and
networking.  Since its release in
\textsl{System V Release 3}, STREAMS has been implemented across a wide range of UNIX, UNIX-like and
UNIX-based systems, making its implementation and use an ipso facto standard.

STREAMS is a facility that allows for a reconfigurable full duplex communications path,
\textit{Stream}, between a user process and a driver in the kernel.   Kernel protocol modules can be
pushed onto and popped from the \textit{Stream} between the user process and driver.  The
\textit{Stream} can be reconfigured in this way by a user process.  The user process, neighbouring
protocol modules and the driver communicate with each other using a message passing scheme.  This
permits a loose coupling between protocol modules, drivers and user processes, allowing a
third-party and loadable kernel module approach to be taken toward the provisioning of protocol
modules on platforms supporting STREAMS.

On \textsl{UNIX System V Release 4.2}, STREAMS was used for terminal input-output, pipes, FIFOs
(named pipes), and network communications.  Modern UNIX, UNIX-like and UNIX-based systems providing
STREAMS normally support some degree of network communications using STREAMS; however, many do not
support STREAMS-based pipe and FIFOs\footnote{For example, AIX.} or terminal
input-output\footnote{For example, HP-UX.} directly or without reconfiguration.

\subsection[Pipe Implementation]{Pipe Implementation}

Traditionally there have been two approaches to implementation of pipes and named pipes (FIFOs):

\subsubsection*{Legacy Approach to Pipes.}

Under the 4.1BSD or SVR3 approach, pipes were implemented using anonymous FIFOs.  That is, when a
pipe was opened, a new instance of a FIFO was obtained, but which was not attached to a node in the
file system and which had two file descriptors: one open for writing and the other opened for
reading.  As FIFOs are a fundamentally unidirectional concept, legacy pipes can only pass data in
one direction.  Also, legacy pipes do not support the concept of record boundaries and only support
a byte stream.  Each end of the pipe uses a the legacy interface and they do not provide any of the
advanced capabilities provided by STREAMS.

\subsubsection*{SVR4 Approach to Pipes.}

Under the SVR4 approach, both pipes and FIFOs are implemented using STREAMS \cite[]{magic}.  When a
pipe is opened, a new instance of a STREAMS-based pipe is obtained, but which is attached to a
non-accessible node in the \texttt{fifofs} file system instead of the normal STREAMS \texttt{specfs}
file system.  Although one file descriptor was opened for read and the other for write, with a
STREAMS-based pipe it is possible to reopen both for reading and writing.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\center\includegraphics[width=3.0in]{streamspipe}
\caption[STREAMS-Based Pipes]{STREAMS-Based Pipes}
\label{figure:streamspipe}
\end{figure}

The STREAMS-based pipes provide the same rich set of facilities that are also available for other
STREAMS devices such as pseudo-terminals and network interfaces.  As a result, STREAMS-based pipes
provide a number of capabilities that are not provided by legacy pipes:

\begin{description}

\item[\textit{Full Duplex.}]

STREAMS-based pipes are full duplex pipes.  That is, each end of the pipe can be used for reading
and writing.  To accomplish the same effect with legacy pipes requires that two legacy pipes be
opened.

\item[\textit{Pushable Modules.}]

STREAMS-based pipes can have STREAMS modules pushed an popped from either end of the pipe, just as
any other STREAMS device.

\item[\textit{File Attachment.}]

STREAMS-based pipes can have either end (or both ends) attached to a node in the file system using
fattach(3) \cite[]{advprog}.

\item[\textit{File Descriptor Passing.}]

STREAMS-based pipes can pass file descriptors across the pipe using the \texttt{I\_SENDFD} and
\texttt{I\_RECVFD} input-output controls \cite[]{advprog}.

\item[\textit{Record Boundary Preservation.}]

STREAMS-based pipes can preserve record boundaries and can pass messages atomically using the
getmsg(2) and putmsg(2) system calls.

\item[\textit{Prioritization of Messages.}]

STREAMS-based pipes can pass messages in priority bands using the getpmsg(2) and putpmsg(2) system
calls.

\end{description}

\subsubsection*{BSD Approach to Pipes.}

As of 4.2BSD, with the introduction of Sockets, pipes were implemented using the networking
subsystem (UNIX domain sockets) for what was cited as \textit{"performance reasons"} \cite[]{bsd}.
The pipe(2) library call effectively calls sockpair(3) and obtains a pair of connected sockets in
the UNIX domain as illustrated in \textit{Figure \ref{figure:socketpipe}}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\center\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{socketpipe}
\caption[4.2BSD Pipes]{4.2BSD Pipes}
\label{figure:socketpipe}
\end{figure}

Knowing the result of this testing, I can only imagine that the \textit{"performance reasons"} had
to do with the lack of a full flow control mechanism in the legacy file system based pipes.

\subsubsection*{Linux Approach to Pipes.}

Linux adopts the legacy (4.1BSD or SVR3 pre-STREAMS) approach to pipes.  Pipes are file system
based, and obtain an \texttt{inode} from the \texttt{pipefs} file system as illustrated in
\textit{Figure \ref{figure:legacypipe}}.  Pipes are unnamed FIFOs, unidirectional byte streams, and
do not provide any of the capabilities of STREAMS-based pipes or socket pairs in the UNIX
domain.\footnote{It has been said of Linux that, without STREAMS, it is just another BSD...  ...and
not a very good one.}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\center\includegraphics[width=3.0in]{legacypipe}
\caption[Linux Legacy Pipes]{Linux Legacy Pipes}
\label{figure:legacypipe}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Standardization.}

During the POSIX standardization process, pipes and FIFOs were given special treatment to ensure
that both the legacy approach to pipes, 4.2BSD approach and the STREAMS-based approach to pipes were
compatible.  POSIX has standardized the programmatic interface to pipes.  STREAMS-based pipes have
been POSIX compliant for many years and were POSIX compliant in the \textsl{SVR4.2} release.  The
STREAMS-based pipes provided by the \textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS} package provides POSIX compliant
STREAMS-based pipes.

As a result, any application utilizing a legacy Linux pipe in a POSIX compliant manner will also be
compatible with STREAMS-based pipes.\footnote{This compatibility is exemplified by the perftest(8)
program which does not distinguish between legacy and STREAMS-based pipes in their implementation or
use.}

\subsection[Linux Fast-STREAMS]{Linux Fast-STREAMS}

The first STREAMS package for Linux that provided SVR4 STREAMS capabilities was the \textsl{Linux
STREAMS (LiS)} package originally available from GCOM.  This package exhibited incompatibilities
with SVR 4.2 STREAMS and other STREAMS implementations, was buggy and performed very poorly on
Linux.  These difficulties prompted the OpenSS7 Project \cite[]{openss7} to implement an SVR 4.2
STREAMS package from scratch, with the objective of production quality and high-performance, named
\textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS}.

The OpenSS7 Project \cite[]{openss7} also maintains public and internal versions of the \textsl{LiS}
package.  The last public release was \textit{LiS-2.18.3}; the current internal release version is
\textit{LiS-2.18.6}.  The current production public release of \textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS} is
\textit{streams-0.9.3}.

\section[Objective]{Objective}

The objective of the current study is to determine whether, for the Linux operating system, the
newer STREAMS-based pipe approach is (from the perspective of performance) a viable replacement for
the legacy 4.1BSD/SVR3-style pipes provided by Linux.  As a side objective, a comparison is also
made to STREAMS-based pipes implemented on the deprecated LiS (Linux STREAMS) package.  This
comparison will demonstrate one reason why \textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS} was written in the first
place.

\paragraph*{Misconceptions}

When developing STREAMS, the authors oft times found that there were a number of preconceptions from
Linux advocates about both STREAMS and STREAMS-based pipes, as follows:

\begin{itemize}

\item STREAMS is slow.

\item STREAMS is more flexible, but less efficient \cite[]{lkmlfaq}.

\item STREAMS performs poorly on uniprocessor and even poorer on SMP.

\item STREAMS-based pipes are slow.

\item STREAMS-based pipes are unnecessarily complex and cumbersome.

\end{itemize}

For example, the Linux kernel mailing list has this to say about STREAMS:

\footnotesize
\begin{quote}

\begin{description}

\item[(REG)] STREAMS allow you to "push" filters onto a network stack.  The idea is that you can
have a very primitive network stream of data, and then "push" a filter ("module") that implements
TCP/IP or whatever on top of that.  Conceptually, this is very nice, as it allows clean separation
of your protocol layers.  Unfortunately, implementing STREAMS poses many performance problems.  Some
Unix STREAMS based server telnet implementations even ran the data up to user space and back down
again to a pseudo-tty driver, which is very inefficient.

STREAMS will \textbf{never} be available in the standard Linux kernel, it will remain a separate
implementation with some add-on kernel support (that come with the STREAMS package).  Linus and his
networking gurus are unanimous in their decision to keep STREAMS out of the kernel.  They have
stated several times on the kernel list when this topic comes up that even optional support will not
be included.

\item[(REW, quoting Larry McVoy)] "It's too bad, I can see why some people think they are cool, but
the performance cost - both on uniprocessors and even more so on SMP boxes - is way too high for
STREAMS to ever get added to the Linux kernel."

Please stop asking for them, we have agreement amoungst the head guy, the networking guys, and the
fringe folks like myself that they aren't going in.

\item[(REG, quoting Dave Grothe, the STREAMS guy)] STREAMS is a good framework for implementing
complex and/or deep protocol stacks having nothing to do with TCP/IP, such as SNA.  It trades some
efficiency for flexibility.  You may find the Linux STREAMS package (LiS) to be quite useful if you
need to port protocol drivers from Solaris or UnixWare, as Caldera did.

\end{description}

The Linux STREAMS (LiS) package is available for download if you want to use STREAMS for Linux.  The
following site also contains a dissenting view, which supports STREAMS.

\end{quote}
\normalsize


It is possible that the proponents of these statements have worked in the past with an improper or
under-performing STREAMS implementation (such as \textsl{LiS}); however, the current study aims to
prove that none of these statements are correct for the STREAMS-based pipes provided by the
high-performance \textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS}.

\section[Description]{Description}

The three implementations tested vary in their implementation details.  These implementation details
are described below.

\subsection[Linux Pipes]{Linux Pipes}

Linux pipes are implemented using a file-system approach similar to that of 4.1BSD, or that of SVR3
and SVR2 releases, or their common Bell Laboratories predecessors, as illustrated in \textit{Figure
\ref{figure:legacypipe}}.  It should be noted that 4.4BSD (and releases after 4.2BSD) implements
pipes using Sockets and the networking subsystem \cite[]{bsd}.  Also, note that SVR4 implemented
pipes using STREAMS.  As such, the Linux pipe implementation is both archaic and deprecated.

\paragraph*{Write side processing.}

In response to a write(2) system call, message bytes are copied from user space to kernel directly
into a preallocated buffer.  The tail pointer is pushed on the buffer.  If the buffer is full at the
time of the system call, the calling process blocks, or the system call fails and returns an error
number (\texttt{EAGAIN} or \texttt{EWOULDBLOCK}).

\paragraph*{Read side processing.}

In response to a read(2) system call, message bytes are copied from the preallocated buffer to user
space.  The head pointer is pushed on the buffer.  If the buffer is empty at the time of the system
call, the calling process blocks, or the system call fails and returns an error number
(\texttt{EAGAIN} or \texttt{EWOULDBLOCK}).

\paragraph*{Buffering.}

If a writer goes to write and there is no more room left in the buffer for the requested write, the
writer blocks or the system call is failed (\texttt{EAGAIN}).  If a reader goes to read and there
are no bytes in the buffer, the reader blocks or the system call is failed (\texttt{EAGAIN}).  If
there are fewer bytes in the buffer than requested by the read operation, the available bytes are
returned.  No queueing or flow control is performed.

\paragraph*{Scheduling.}

When a writer is blocked or polling for write, the writer is awoken once there is room to write at
least 1 byte into the buffer.  When a reader is blocked or polling for read, the reader is awoken
once there is at least 1 byte in the buffer.

\subsection[STREAMS-based Pipes]{STREAMS-based Pipes}

STREAMS-based pipes are implemented using a specialized STREAMS driver that connects the read and
write queues of two \textit{Stream heads} in a twisted pair configuration as illustrated in
\textit{Figure \ref{figure:streamspipe}}.  Aside from a few specialized settings particular to
pipes, each \textit{Stream head} acts in the same fashion as the \textit{Stream head} for any other
STREAMS device or pseudo-device.

\paragraph*{Write side processing.}

In response to a write(2) system call, message bytes are copied from user space into allocated
message blocks.  Message blocks are passed downstream to the next module (read \textit{Stream head})
in the \textit{Stream}.  If flow control is in effect on the write queue at the time of the system
call, the calling process blocks, or the system call fails and returns an error number
(\texttt{EAGAIN}).  Also, STREAMS has a write message coalescing feature that allows message blocks
to be held temporarily on the write queue awaiting execution of the write queue service procedure
(invoked by the STREAMS scheduler) or the occurrence of another write operation.

\paragraph*{Read side processing.}

In response to a read(2) system call, message blocks are removed from the read queue and message
bytes copied from kernel to user space.  If there are no message blocks in the read queue at the
time of the system call, the calling process blocks, or the system call fails and returns and error
number (\texttt{EAGAIN}).  Also, STREAMS has a read notification feature that causes a read
notification message (\texttt{M\_READ}) containing the requested number of bytes to be issued  and
passed downstream before blocking.  STREAMS has an additional read-fill mode feature which causes
the read side to attempt to satisfy the entire read request before returning to the user.

\paragraph*{Buffering.}

If a writer goes to write and the write queue is flow controlled, the writer blocks or the system
call is failed (\texttt{EAGAIN}).  If a reader goes to read and there are no message blocks
available, the reader blocks or the system call is failed (\texttt{EAGAIN}).  If there are fewer
bytes available in message blocks on the read queue than requested by the read operation, the
available bytes are returned.  Normal STREAMS queueing and flow control is performed as message
blocks are passed along the write side or removed from the read queue.

\paragraph*{Scheduling.}

When a write is blocked or polling for write, the writer is awoken once flow control subsides on the
write side.  Flow control subsides when the downstream module's queue on the write side falls below
its low water mark, the \textit{Stream} is back-enabled, and the write queue service procedure runs.
When a reader is blocked or polling for read, the reader is awoken once the read queue service
procedure runs.  The read queue service procedure is scheduled when the first message block is
placed on the read queue after an attempt to remove a message block from the queue failed.  The
service procedure runs when the STREAMS scheduler runs.

\section[Method]{Method}

To test the performance of STREAMS-based pipes, the \textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS} package was used
\cite[]{LfS}.  The \textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS} package builds and install Linux loadable kernel
modules and includes the
\texttt{perftest} program used for testing.  For comparison, the \textsl{LiS} package \cite[]{LiS}
was used for comparison.

\subsection[Test Program]{Test Program}

To test the maximum throughput performance of both legacy pipes and STREAMS-based pipes, a test
program was written, called \texttt{perftest}.  The \texttt{perftest} program is part of the
\textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS} distribution \cite[]{LfS}.  The test program performs the following
actions:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Opens either a legacy pipe or a STREAMS-based pipe.

\item Forks two child processes: a writer child process and a reader child process.

\item The writer child process closes the reading end of the pipe.

\item The writer child process starts an interval timer.

\item The writer child process begins writing data to the pipe end with the write(2) system call.

\item As the writer child process writes to the pipe end, it tallies the amount of data written.
When the interval timer expires, the tally is output and the interval timer restarted.

\item The reader child process closes the writing end of the pipe.

\item The reader child process starts an interval timer.

\item The reader child process begins reading data from the pipe end with the read(2) system call.

\item As the reader child process reads from the pipe end, it tallies the amount of data written.
When the interval timer expires, the tally is output and the interval timer restarted.

\end{enumerate}

The test program thus simulates a typical use of pipes in a Linux system.  The
\texttt{perftest\_script} performance testing script was used to obtain repeatable results (see
\textit{Appendix \ref{section:script}}).

\subsection[Disributions Tested]{Distrbutions Tested}

To remove the dependence of test results on a particular Linux kernel or machine, various Linux
distributions were used for testing.  The distributions tested are as follows:

\small
\setlength{\tabcolsep}{0.4em}
\setlength{\arraycolsep}{0.4em}
\begin{tabular}{ll}\\

Ubuntu 7.04 & 2.6.20-15-generic\\
Fedora Core 6 & 2.6.20-1.2933.fc6
\end{tabular}\\

\subsection[Test Machines]{Test Machines}

To remove the dependence of test results on a particular machine, various machines were used for
testing as follows:

\small

mspiggy & 1.7GHz PIV & 1Gb (333MHz) & i686 UP\\
\end{tabular}\\
\normalsize

\section[Results]{Results}

The results for the various distributions and machines is tabulated in \textit{Appendix
\ref{section:rawdata}}.  The data is tabulated as follows:

\begin{description}

\item[{\it Performance.}]

Performance is charted by graphing the number of writes per second against the logarithm of the
write size.

\item[{\it Delay.}]

Delay is charted by graphing the number of second per write against the write size.  The delay can
be modelled as a fixed write overhead per write operation and a fixed overhead per byte written.
This model results in a linear graph with the intercept at 1 byte per write representing the fixed
per-write overhead, and the slope of the line representing the per-byte cost.  As all
implementations use the same primary mechanisms for copying bytes to and from user space, it is
expected that the slope of each graph will be similar and that the intercept will reflect most
implementation differences.

\item[{\it Throughput.}]

Throughput is charted by graphing the logarithm of the product of the number of writes per second
and the message size against the logarithm of the message size.  It is expected that these graphs
will exhibit strong log-log-linear (power function) characteristics.  Any curvature in these graphs
represent throughput saturation.

\item[{\it Improvement.}]

Improvement is charted by graphing the quotient of the writes per second of the implementation and
the writes per second of the Linux legacy pipe implementation as a percentage against the write
size.  Values over 0\% represent an improvement over Linux legacy pipes, whereas values under 0\%
represent the lack of an improvement.

\item[Performance.]

\textit{Figure \ref{figure:fc6perf}}
illustrates the performance of \textsl{LiS}, \textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS} and Linux legacy pipes
across a range of write sizes.  As can be see from \textit{Figure \ref{figure:fc6perf}}, the
performance of \textsl{LiS} is dismal across the entire range of write sizes.  The performance of
\textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS} STREAMS-based pipes, on the other hand, is superior across the entire
range of write sizes.  Performance of \textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS} is a full order of magnitude
better than \textsl{LiS}.

\item[Delay.]

\textit{Figure \ref{figure:fc6delay}}
illustrates the average write delay for \textsl{LiS}, \textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS} and Linux legacy
pipes across a range of write sizes.  The slope of all three curves is comparable and about the
same.  This indicates that each implementation is only slightly dependent upon the size of the
message and each implementation has a low per-byte processing overhead.  This is as expected as
pipes primarily copy data from user space to the kernel just to copy it back to user space on the
other end.  Note that the intercepts, on the other hand, differ to a significant extent.
\textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS} STREAMS-based pipes have by far the lowest per-write overhead (about
half that of the Linux legacy pipes, and a sixth of \textsl{LiS} pipes).

\item[Throughput.]

\textit{Figure \ref{figure:fc6thrput}}
illustrates the throughput experienced by \textsl{LiS}, \textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS} and Linux legacy
pipes across a range of write sizes.  As can be seen from \textit{Figure \ref{figure:fc6thrput}},
all implementations exhibit strong power function characteristics, indicating structure and
robustness for each implementation (regardless of performance).

\item[Improvement.]

\textit{Figure \ref{figure:fc6comp}}
illustrates the improvement over Linux legacy pipes of \textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS} STREAMS-based
pipes.  The improvement of \textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS} over Linux legacy pipes is marked:
improvements range from a significant 75\% increase in performance at large write sizes, to a
staggering 200\% increase in performance at lower write sizes.

\subsection[Pumbah]{Pumbah}

Pumbah is a 2.57GHz Pentium IV (i686) uniprocessor machine with 1Gb of memory.  This machine differs

Pumbah is a control machine and is used to rule out differences between recent 2.6 kernels and one
of the oldest and most stable 2.4 kernels.

\subsubsection[RedHat 7.2]{RedHat 7.2}

RedHat 7.2 is one of the oldest (and arguably the most stable) glibc2 based releases of the RedHat

across a range of write sizes.  As can be see from \textit{Figure \ref{figure:rh7perf}}, the
performance of \textsl{LiS} is dismal across the entire range of write sizes.  The performance of
\textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS} STREAMS-based pipes, on the other hand, is superior across the entire
range of write sizes.  At a write size of one byte, the performance of \textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS}
is an order of magnitude greater than \textsl{LiS}.

\item[Delay.]

\textit{Figure \ref{figure:rh7delay}}
illustrates the average write delay for \textsl{LiS}, \textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS} and Linux legacy
pipes across a range of write sizes.  The slope of all three graphs is similar, indicating that
memory caching and copy to and from user performance on a byte-by-byte basis is similar.  The
intercepts, on the other hand, are drastically different.  \textsl{LiS} per-message overheads are
massive.  \textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS} and Linux legacy pipes are far better.  STREAMS-based pipes
have about one third of the per-message overhead of legacy pipes.

\item[Throughput.]

robustness for each implementation (despite performance differences).  On Pumbah, as was experienced
on Porky, \textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS} is beginning to saturate the memory bus at 10Gbps.

\item[Improvement.]

\textit{Figure \ref{figure:rh7comp}}
illustrates the improvement over Linux legacy pipes of \textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS} STREAMS-based
pipes.  The improvement of \textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS} over Linux legacy pipes is significant:
improvements range from a 75\% increase in performance at large write sizes, to a 175\% increase in
performance at lower write sizes.  \textsl{LiS} pipes waddle in at a 75\% {\em decrease} in
performance.

non-hyper-threaded machines.  This machine is hyper-threaded and runs full SMP kernels.  This
machine also supports EMT64 and runs \texttt{x86\_64} kernels.  It is used to rule out both SMP

Mspiggy is a 1.7Ghz Pentium IV (M-processor) uniprocessor notebook (Toshiba Satellite 5100) with 1Gb
of memory.  Linux distributions tested on this machine are as follows:

\small
\setlength{\tabcolsep}{0.4em}
\setlength{\arraycolsep}{0.4em}
\begin{tabular}{ll}\\
Distribution & Kernel\\
\hline
SuSE 10.0 OSS & 2.6.13-15-default\\
\end{tabular}\\[1.0ex]
\normalsize

Note that this is the same distribution that was also tested on Porky.  The purpose of testing on
this notebook is to rule out the differences between machine architectures on the test results.
Tests performed on this machine are control tests.

\subsubsection[SuSE 10.0 OSS]{SuSE 10.0 OSS}

SuSE 10.0 OSS is the public release version of the SuSE/Novell distribution.  There have been two
releases subsequent to this one: the 10.1 and recent 10.2 releases.  The SuSE 10 release sports a
2.6.13 kernel and the 2.6.13-15-default kernel was the tested kernel.

\item[Performance.]

\textit{Figure \ref{figure:nbperf}}
illustrates the performance of \textsl{LiS}, \textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS} and Linux legacy pipes
across a range of write sizes.  As can be see from \textit{Figure \ref{figure:nbperf}}, the
performance of \textsl{LiS} is dismal across the entire range of write sizes.  The performance of
\textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS} STREAMS-based pipes, on the other hand, is superior across the entire
range of write sizes.  \textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS} again performs a full order of magnitude better
than \textsl{LiS}.

\item[Delay.]

\textit{Figure \ref{figure:nbdelay}}
illustrates the average write delay for \textsl{LiS}, \textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS} and Linux legacy
pipes across a range of write sizes.  The slope of the delay curves is, again, similar, but the
intercept for \textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS} is far superior.

\item[Throughput.]

\textit{Figure \ref{figure:nbthrput}}
illustrates the throughput experienced by \textsl{LiS}, \textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS} and Linux legacy
pipes across a range of write sizes.  As can be seen from \textit{Figure \ref{figure:nbthrput}}, all
implementations exhibit strong power function characteristics, indicating structure and robustness
for each implementation.  \textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS} again begins to saturate the memory bus at
10Gbps.

\item[Improvement.]

\textit{Figure \ref{figure:nbcomp}}
illustrates the improvement over Linux legacy pipes of \textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS} STREAMS-based
pipes.  The improvement of \textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS} over Linux legacy pipes is significant:
improvements range from a 100\% increase in performance at large write sizes, to a staggering 400\%
increase in performance at lower write sizes.

\end{description}

\section[Analysis]{Analysis}

The results across the various distributions and machines tested are consistent enough to draw some
conclusions from the test results.

\subsection[Discussion]{Discussion}

The test results reveal that the maximum throughput performance, as tested by the \texttt{perftest}
program, of STREAMS-based pipes (as implemented by \textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS}) is remarkably
superior to that of legacy Linux pipes, regardless of write or read sizes.  In fact, STREAMS-based
pipe performance at smaller write/read sizes is significantly greater (as much as 200-400\%) than
that of legacy pipes.  The performance of \textsl{LiS} is dismal (approx. 75\% {\em decrease})
compared to legacy Linux pipes.

Looking at only the legacy Linux and \textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS} implementations, the difference can
be described by analyzing the implementations.

\paragraph*{Write side processing.}

Linux legacy pipes use a simple method on the write side of the pipe.  The pipe copies bytes from
the user into a preallocated page, by pushing a tail pointer.  If there is a sleeping reader
process, the process is awoken.  If there is no more room in the buffer, the write process sleeps or
fails.

STREAMS, on the other hand, uses full flow control.  On the write side of the STREAMS-based pipe,
the \textit{Stream head} allocates a message block and copies the bytes from the user to the message
block and places the message block onto the \textit{Stream}.  This results in placing the message on
the opposite \textit{Stream head}.  If a reader is sleeping on the opposite \textit{Stream head},
the \textit{Stream head}'s read queue service procedure is scheduled.  If the \textit{Stream} is
flow controlled, the writing process sleeps or fails.

STREAMS has the feature that when a reader finds insufficient bytes available to satisfy the read,
it issues an \texttt{M\_READ} message downstream requesting a specific number of bytes.  When the
writing \textit{Stream head} receives this message, it attempts to satisfy the full read request
before sending data downstream.

\textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS} also has the feature that when flow control is exerted, it saves the
message buffer and a subsequent write of the same size is added to the same buffer.

\paragraph*{Read side processing.}

On the read side of the legacy pipe, bytes are copied from the preallocated page buffer to the user,
pulling a head pointer.  If there are no bytes available to be read in the buffer, the reading
process sleeps or fails.  When bytes have been read from the buffer and a process is sleeping
waiting to write, the sleeping process is awoken.

STREAMS again uses full flow control.  On the read side of the STREAMS-based pipe, messages are
removed from the \textit{Stream head} read queue, copied to the user, and then the message is either
freed (when all the bytes contained are consumed) or placed back on the \textit{Stream head} read
queue.  If the read queue was previously full and falls beneath the low water mark for the read
queue, the \textit{Stream} is back-enabled.  Back-enabling results in the service procedure of the
write side queue of the other \textit{Stream head} to be scheduled for service.  If there are no
bytes available to be read, the reading process sleeps or fails.

STREAMS has the additional feature that if there are no bytes to be read, it can issue an
\texttt{M\_READ} message downstream requesting the number of bytes that were issued to the read(2)
system call.

\paragraph*{Buffering.}

There are two primary differences in the buffering approaches used by legacy and STREAMS-based
pipes:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Legacy pipes use preallocated pinned kernel pages to store data using a simply head and tail
pointer approach.

\item STREAMS-based pipes use full flow control with STREAMS message blocks and message queues.

\end{enumerate}

One would expect that the STREAMS-based approach would present significant overheads in comparison
to the legacy approach; however, the lack of flow control in the Linux approach is problematic.

\paragraph*{Scheduling.}

Legacy pipes schedule by waking a reading process whenever data is available in the buffer to be
read, and waking a writing process whenever there is room available in the buffer to write.  While
accomplishing buffering, this does not provide flow control or scheduling.  By not providing even
the hysteresis afforded by Sockets, the write and read side thrash the scheduler as bytes are
written to and removed from the pipe.

STREAMS-based pipes, on the other hand, use the scheduling mechanisms of STREAMS.  When messages are
written to the reading \textit{Stream head} and a reader is sleeping, the service procedure for the
reading \textit{Stream head}'s read queue is scheduled for later execution.  When the STREAMS
scheduler later runs, the reading process is awoken.  When message are read from the reading
\textit{Stream head} read queue and the queue was previously flow controlled, and the byte count
falls below the low water mark defined for the queue, the writing \textit{Stream head} write queue
service procedure is scheduled.  Once the STREAMS scheduler later runs, the writing process is
awoken.

\textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS} is designed to run tasks queued to the STREAMS scheduler on the same
processor as the queueing process or task.  This avoids unnecessary context switches.

The STREAMS-based pipe approach results in fewer wakeup events being generated.  Because there are
fewer wakeup events, there are fewer context switches.  The reading process is permitted to consume
more messages before the writing process is awoken; and the writing process is permitted to write
more messages before the reading process is awoken.

\paragraph*{Result.}

The result of the differences between the legacy and the STREAMS based approach is that fewer
context switches result: writing processes are allowed to write more messages before a blocked
reader is awoken and the reading process is allowed to read more messages before a blocked writer is
awoken.  This results in greater code path and data cache efficiency and significantly less
scheduler thrashing between the reading and writing process.

The increased performance of the STREAMS-based pipes can be explained as follows:

\begin{itemize}

\item

The STREAMS message coalescing features allows the complexity of the write side process to approach
that of the legacy approach.  This feature provides a boost to performance at message sizes smaller
than a \texttt{FASTBUF}.  The size of a \texttt{FASTBUF} on 32-bit systems is 64 bytes; on 64-bit
systems, 128 bytes.  (However, this STREAMS feature is not sufficient to explain the dramatic
performance gains, as close to the same performance is exhibited with the feature disabled.)

\item

The STREAMS read notification feature allows the write side to exploit efficiencies from the
knowledge of the amount of data that was requested by the read side.  (However, this STREAMS feature
is also not sufficient to explain the performance gains, as close to the same performance is
exhibited with the feature disabled.)

\item

The STREAMS read fill mode feature permits the read side to block until the full read request is
satisfied, regardless of the \texttt{O\_NONBLOCK} flags setting associated with the read side of the
pipe.  (Again, this STREAMS feature is not sufficient to explain the performance gains, as close to
the same performance is exhibited with the feature disabled.)

\item

The STREAMS flow control and scheduling mechanisms permits the read side to read more messages
between wakeup events; and also permits the write side to write more messages between wakeup events.
This results in superior code and data caching efficiencies and a greatly reduced number of context
switches.  This is the only difference that explains the full performance increase in STREAMS-based
pipes over legacy pipes.

\end{itemize}

\section[Conclusions]{Conclusions}

These experiments have shown that the \textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS} implementation of STREAMS-based
pipes outperforms the legacy Linux pipe implementation by a significant amount (up to a factor of 5)
and outperform the \textsl{LiS} implementation by a staggering amount (up to a factor of 25).

\begin{quote}
\textit{The \textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS} implementation of STREAMS-based pipes is superior by a
significant factor across all systems and kernels tested.}
\end{quote}

While it can be said that all of the preconceptions regarding STREAMS and STREAMS-based pipes are
applicable to the under-performing \textsl{LiS}, and may very well be applicable to historical
implementations of STREAMS, these preconceptions with regard to STREAMS and STREAMS-based pipes are
dispelled for the high-performance \textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS} by these test results.

\begin{itemize}

\item \textit{STREAMS is fast.}

Contrary to the preconception that STREAMS must be slower because it is more complex, in fact the
reverse has been shown to be true for \textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS} in these experiments.  The STREAMS
flow control and scheduling mechanisms serve to adapt well and increase both code and data cache as
well as scheduler efficiency.

\item \textit{STREAMS is more flexible {\em and} more efficient.}

Contrary to the preconception that STREAMS trades flexibility for efficiency (that is, that STREAMS
is somehow less efficient because it is more flexible), in fact has shown to be untrue for
\textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS}, which is {\em both} more flexible {\em and} more efficient.  Indeed,
the performance gains achieved by STREAMS appear to derive from its more sophisticated queueing,
scheduling and flow control model. (Note that this is in fitting with the statements made about
4.2BSD pipes being implemented with UNIX domain sockets for \textit{"performance reasons"}
\cite[]{bsd}.)

\item \textit{Linux Fast-STREAMS adequately exploits parallelisms on SMP.}

Contrary to the preconception that STREAMS must be slower due to complex locking and synchronization
mechanisms, \textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS} performed as well on SMP (hyperthreaded) machines as on UP
machines and still outperformed legacy Linux pipes with over 100\% improvements at all write sizes.

\item \textit{STREAMS-based pipes are fast.}

Contrary to the preconception that STREAMS-based pipes must be slower because STREAMS-based pipes
provide such a rich set of features as well as providing full duplex operation where legacy pipes
only unidirectional operation, the reverse has been shown in these experiments for \textsl{Linux
Fast-STREAMS}.  By utilizing STREAMS flow control and scheduling, STREAMS-based pipes indeed perform
better than legacy pipes.

\item \textit{STREAMS-based pipes are neither unnecessarily complex nor cumbersome.}

Contrary to the preconception that STREAMS-based pipes must be poorer due to their increased
implementation complexity, the reverse has shown to be true in these experiments for \textsl{Linux
Fast-STREAMS}.  Also, the fact that legacy, STREAMS and 4.2BSD pipes conform to the same standard
(POSIX), means that they are no more cumbersome from a programming perspective.  Indeed a POSIX
conforming application will not know the difference between the implementation (with the exception
that superior performance will be experienced on STREAMS-based pipes).

\item \textit{\textsl{LiS} performs poorly.}

Despite claiming to be an adequate implementation of SVR4 STREAMS, \textsl{LiS} performance is
dismal enough to make it unusable.  Due to conformance and implementation errors, \textsl{LiS} was
already deprecated by \textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS}, and these tests exemplify why a replacement for
\textsl{LiS} was necessary and why support for \textsl{LiS} was abandoned by the OpenSS7 Project
\cite[]{openss7}.  \textsl{LiS} pipe performance tested about half that of legacy Linux pipes and a
full order of magnitude slower than \textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS}.

\end{itemize}

\section[Future Work]{Future Work}

There are two future work items that immediately come to mind:

\begin{enumerate}

\item

It is fairly straightforward to replace the pipe implementation of an application that uses shared
libraries from underneath it using preloaded libraries.  The \textsl{Linux Fast-STREAMS}
\texttt{libstreams.so} library can be preloaded, replacing the pipe(2) library call with the
STREAMS-based pipe equivalent.  A suitable application that uses pipes extensively could be
benchmarked both on legacy Linux pipes and STREAMS-based pipes to determine the efficiencies
achieved over a less narrowly defined workload.

\item

Because STREAMS-based pipes exhibit superior performance in these respects, it can be expected that
STREAMS pseudo-terminals will also exhibit superior performance over the legacy Linux
pseudo-terminal implementation.  STREAMS pseudo-terminals utilize the STREAMS mechanisms for flow
control and scheduling, whereas the Linux pseudo-terminal implementation uses the over-simplified
approach taken by legacy pipes.

\end{enumerate}

\section[Related Work]{Related Work}

A separate paper comparing a TPI STREAMS implementation of \textsl{UDP} with the Linux BSD Sockets
implementation has also been prepared.  That paper also shows significant performance improvements
for STREAMS attributable to the similar causes.
