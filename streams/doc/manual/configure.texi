@c This file is include from install.texi and contains the descriptions for
@c package-specific enable/disable and with/without options

In addition, the following @command{configure} options, specific to the
@value{PACKAGE_TITLE} package are available:

@table @command

@item --enable-streams-bcm
@opindex streams-bcm
Enable @dfn{STREAMS} binary compatibility mode.
When enabled, exported functions (and callouts) will never pass three arguments in registers on
architectures supporting @code{regparm} (i.e. @var{__i386__}, @var{__x86_64__}, @var{__k8__})
regardless of how the kernel was compiled.  Additional @cite{LiS} binary compatibility is also
enabled (e.g. credentials).
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@item --disable-streams-irq
@opindex streams-irq
Disable @dfn{STREAMS} irq suppression.
When enabled, hard interrupts are suppressed whenever locks are taken throughout the @dfn{STREAMS}
executive.  When profiling using masked interrupt driven profilers, this makes profiling
difficult.  When disabled, soft interrupts are suppressed only.  This allows interrupt driven
profilers to give more meaningful information.  Do not disable hard interrupt suppression unless you
know what your are doing.  Also, as the softirq threads are run whenever soft interrupt locks are
released, this has a negative impact on @dfn{STREAMS} performance.
This option defaults to @samp{enabled}.

@item --enable-streams-stats
@opindex streams-stats
Enable @dfn{STREAMS} statistics counting.
When disabled, it is the module or driver's responsibility to increment @dfn{STREAMS} statistics
upon entry to putp, srvp, qopen, qclose and qadmin procedures.  When enabled, @dfn{STREAMS} will
perform statistics counting of entry to the putp, srvp, qopen, qclose and qadmin procedures whenever
a module_stat structure is associated with the queue.  The @manref{scls(8)} utility can be used to
display the statistics of any module or driver.  Enabling this feature has a slight negative impact
on performance and is contrary to @cite{SVR 4.2} behaviour and is, therefore, disabled by default.
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@item --enable-streams-syncqs
@opindex streams-syncqs
When enabled, MP synchronization queues are enabled for SMP kernels.
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.
This option is not tested for early releases.

@item --disable-streams-kthreads
@opindex streams-kthreads
When enabled, the @dfn{STREAMS} scheduler runs as a kernel thread.  When disabled, the @dfn{STREAMS} scheduler
runs as a software interrupt (bottom half).
Running the @dfn{STREAMS} scheduler at bottom half instead of a kernel thread breaks the @file{strinet}
driver, which must be able to invoke kernel functions that might sleep (but don't).
This option defaults to @samp{enabled}.

@item --disable-streams-utils
@opindex streams-utils
We experimented with putting the @dfn{STREAMS} utilities into their own package, @file{strutil},
however, this is not complete yet.  As the @file{strutil} was only necessary because @cite{LiS} did
not support these utilities itself, and @cite{LiS} is deprecated, the @file{strutil} package is also
deprecated, and this feature should always be left enabled.
This option defaults to @samp{enabled}.
Do not disable this option.

@item --disable-big-compile
@opindex big-compile
When enabled, the @dfn{STREAMS}, the Stream head, and the clone driver are all compiled together in one
big compilation unit.  This allows the compiler greater opportunity to optimize.
This option defaults to @samp{enabled}.
Do not disable this option.

@item --enable-module-sth
@opindex module-sth
Enable @file{sth} (stream head) module linked into @file{streams} object.
The default is to create the module as a separate loadable kernel module,
unless option @samp{big-compile} is specified.
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.
This option defaults to @samp{enabled} if @samp{big-compile} is enabled.

@item --enable-module-bufmod
@opindex module-bufmod
Enable @file{bufmod} module linked into @file{streams} object.
The default is to create the module as a separate loadable kernel module.
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@item --enable-module-nullmod
@opindex module-nullmod
Enable @file{nullmod} module linked into @file{streams} object.
The default is to create the module as a separate loadable kernel module.
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@item --enable-module-pipemod
@opindex module-pipemod
Enable @file{pipemod} module linked into @file{streams} object.
The default is to create the module as a separate loadable kernel module.
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@item --enable-module-connld
@opindex module-connld
Enable @file{connld} module linked into @file{streams} object.
The default is to create the module as a separate loadable kernel module.
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@item --enable-module-sc
@opindex module-sc
Enable @file{sc} module linked into @file{streams} object.
The default is to create the module as a separate loadable kernel module.
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@item --enable-module-testmod
@opindex module-testmod
Enable @file{testmod} module linked into @file{streams} object.
The default is to create the module as a separate loadable kernel module.
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@item --enable-driver-clone
@opindex driver-clone
Enable @file{clone} driver linked into @file{streams} object.
The default is to create the driver as a separate loadable kernel module,
unless option @samp{big-compile} is specified.
This option defaults to @samp{disabled}.
This option defaults to @samp{enabled} if @samp{big-compile} is enabled.

@item --enable-driver-echo
@opindex driver-echo
Enable @file{echo} driver linked into @file{streams} object.

@item --enable-driver-fifo

@item --enable-driver-log
@opindex driver-log
