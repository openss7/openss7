Prerequisites
-------------

The following are prerequisites for building the package:

 1. Linux distribution with a 2.4 or 2.6 kernel with the appropriate
    tool chain.  For supported and tested distributions, see the manual.

 2. OpenSS7 Linux Fast-STREAMS or OpenSS7 Modified Linux STREAMS
    installed, such as
    http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/streams-0.7a.5.tar.bz2 or
    http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/LiS-2.18.3.tar.bz2

    (Note that the `LiS' package is deprecated.  We recommend using the
    `streams' package instead.)

 3. OpenSS7 STREAMS Compatibility Modules installed, such as
    http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/strcompat-0.9.2.3.tar.bz2

When configuring and building multiple OpenSS7 Project release packages,
place all of the source packages (unpackaged tarballs) at the same
directory level and all build directories at the same directory level.

Installation
------------

The following commands will download, configure, build, check, install,
validate, uninstall and remove the package:

	wget http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/strxns-0.9.2.3.tar.bz2
	tar -xjvf strxns-0.9.2.3.tar.bz2
	mkdir build
	cd build
	../strxns-0.9.2.3.configure
	make
	make check
	sudo make install
	sudo make installcheck
	sudo make uninstall
	cd ..
	sudo rm -rf build
	rm -rf strxns-0.9.2.3.
	rm -f strxns-0.9.2.3.tar.bz2

Manual
------

More detailed installation instructions can be found in the Installation
and Reference Manual, contained in the distribution in `text', `info',
`html', and `pdf' formats:

	cd ../strxns-0.9.2.3
	less doc/manual/strxns.txt
	lynx doc/manual/strxns.html
	info -f doc/manual/strxns.info
	xpdf doc/manual/strxns.pdf

Project website at:

Description
-----------

The OpenSS7 STREAMS XNS packagse contains header files and a number of
modules and drivers and the associated documentation that were formerly
contained in the OpenSS7 Linux STREAMS (LiS) releases.  When development
started on Linux Fast-STREAMS in 2003, these modules were removed from
the LiS distribution and separated so that they could build against both
the LiS and Linux Fast-STREAMS packages from the same baseline code.

The package contains the following standard OSI conforming header files:

	- <sys/cdi.h> Communications Device Interface
	- <sys/dlpi.h> Data Link Provider Interface Version 2.0.0
	- <sys/npi.h> Network Provider Interface Version 2.0.0

Note that the TPI header files are contained in the strxnet package.

The package currently includes the following STREAMS kernel modules and
drivers:

	- streams_link_driver.ko    /dev/ldl
	- streams_ip_to_dlpi.ko	    /dev/ip2xinet
	- streams_ip_strms.ko	    module

The ldl(4) driver attempts to provide a DLPI interface to an existing
Ethernet driver under Linux.  This driver was orignally written by Ole
Husgaard and subsequently modified by Dave Grothe and later by Brian
Bidulock of The OpenSS7 Project.  It is distributed under the terms of
the GPL Version 2.

The ip2xnet(4) driver attempts the reverse: to take a STREAMS Ethernet
driver that supports the DLPI interface and link it underneath the
ip2xnet(4) multiplexing driver to make it available for use by the Linux
IP subsystem.  The driver was originally written by The Software Group
Ltd. and subsequently modified by Brian Bidulock of The OpenSS7 Project.
It was originally distributed under the terms of the LGPL, but is
distributed by The OpenSS7 Project under the terms of the GPL Version 2.

The ip_strms(4) module is similar to the ip2xnet(4) driver, however,
this is a module that is pushed over the DLPI Stream corresponding to
the DLPI driver instead of linking the DLPI Stream under a multiplexing
driver as is done with the ip2xnet(4) driver.  Both have a similar
effect.  The module was originally written by Mikel Matthews and Dave
Grothe and subsequently modified by Brian Bidulock of The OpenSS7
Project.  It was originally distributed under the terms of the LGPL, but
is distributed by The OpenSS7 Project under the terms of the GPL Version
2.

The OpenSS7 STREAMS XNS package includes kernel modules, SVR 4.2 STREAMS
drivers, modules, libraries, utilities, test programs, daemons, and
development environment for the development and execution of X/Open
Network Services (XNS) protocol stack components and applications for
the SVR 4.2 STREAMS environment.

This distribution is only currently applicable to Linux 2.4 and 2.6
kernels and was targetted at ix86, x86_64, ppc and ppc64 architectures,
but should build and install for other architectures as well.

Brief Installation Instructions
-------------------------------

The OpenSS7 STREAMS XNS package is available from the downloads area of
The OpenSS7 Project website: <http://www.openss7.org/download.html>
using a command such as:

	wget http://www.openss7.org/tarballs/strxns-0.9.2.3.tar.bz2

Unpack the tarball using a command such as:

	tar -xjvf strxns-0.9.2.3.tar.bz2

The tarball will unpack into the relative subdirectory named after the
package name: strxns-0.9.2.3  The package builds using the GNU autoconf
utilities and the `configure' script.  To build the package, we
recommend using a separate build directory as follows:

	mkdir build
	cd build
	../strxns-0.9.2.3/configure

In general, the package configures and builds without adding any special
options to the configure script.  For general options to the configure
script, see the GNU `INSTALL' file in the distribution:

	less ../strxns-0.9.2.3/INSTALL

For specific options to the configure script, see the INSTALL-strxns
file in the distribution, or simply execute the configure script with
the --help option like so:

	../strxns-0.9.2.3/configure --help

After configuring the package, the package can be compiled simply by
issuing the `make' command:

	make

Some specialized makefile targets exist, see the README-make file in the
distribution or simply invoke the `help' target like so:

	make help

After successfully building the package, the package can be checked by
invoking the `check' make target like so:

	make check

After successfully checking the package, the package can be installed by
invoking the `install' make target (as root) like so:

	sudo make install

The testsuites that ship with the package can be invoked after the
package has been installed by invoking the `installcheck' target.  This
target can either be invoked as root, or as a normal user, like so:

	make installcheck

The package can be cleanly removed by invoking the `uninstall' target
(as root):

	sudo make uninstall

Then the build directory and tarball can be simply removed:

	cd ..
	rm -rf build
	rm -rf strxns-0.9.2.3
	rm -f strxns-0.9.2.3.tar.bz2
