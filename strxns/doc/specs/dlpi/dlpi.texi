@chapter Introduction

This document specifies a STREAMS kernel-level instantiation of the ISO Data
Link Service Definition DIS 8886@footnote{International Organization for
Standardization, "Data Link Service Definition for Open Systems Interconnection,"
DIS 8886, February 1987.} and Logical Link Control DIS 8802/2 (LLC)@footnote{
International Organization for Standardization, "Logical Link Control," DIS
8802/2, 1985.}.  Where the two standards do not conform, DIS 8886 prevails.

The Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI) enables a data link service user to
access and use any of a variety of conforming data link service providers without
special knowledge of the provider's protocol.  Specifically, the interface is
intended to support X.25 LAPB, BX.25 level 2, SDLC, ISDN LAPD, Ethernet(TM),
CSMA/CD, FDDI, token ring, token bus, and Bisync.  Among the expected data link
service users are implementations of the OSI network layer and SNA path control.

The interface specifies access to data link service providers, and does not
define a specific protocol implementation.  Thus, issues of network management,
protocol performance, and performance analysis tools are beyond the scope of
this document and should be addressed by specific implementations of a data link
provider.  However, accompanying each provider implementation should be
information that describes the protocol-specific behavior of that provider.
Currently, there are plans to come up with a set of implementor's
agreements/guidelines for common data link providers.  These agreements will
address issues such as DLSAP address space, subsequent addresses, PPA access and
control, QOS, supported services etc.

This specification assumes the reader is familiar with OSI Reference Model[4]
terminology, OSI Data Link Services, and STREAMS.

@end menu

The data link layer (layer 2 in the OSI Reference Model) is responsible for the
transmission and error-free delivery of bits of information over a physical
communications medium.

The model of the data link layer is presented here to describe concepts that are
used throughout the specification of DLPI.  It is described in terms of an
interface architecture, as well as addressing concepts needed to identify
different components of that architecture.  The description of the model
assumes familiarity with the OSI Reference Model.

@node Model of the Service Interface
@section Model of the Service Interface

Each layer of the OSI Reference Model has two standards:

@itemize @bullet
@item one that defines the services provided by the layer, and
@item one that defines the protocol through which layer services are provided.
@end itemize

DLPI is an implementation of the first type of standard.  It specifies an
interface to the services of the data link layer.  The following figure depicts
the abstract view of DLPI.

@figuresized{dlpi_fig1,1,Abstract View of DLPI,4in}

The data link interface is the boundary between the network and data link layers
of the OSI Reference Model.  The network layer entity is the user of the services
of the data link interface (DLS user), and the data link layer entity is the
provider of those services (DLS provider).  This interface consists of a set
of primitives that provide access to the data link layer services, plus the rules
for using those primitives (state transition rules).  A data link interface
service primitive might request a particular service or indicate a pending event.

To provide uniformity among the various UNIX system networking products, an
effort is underway to develop service interfaces that map to the OSI Reference
Model.  A set of kernel-level interfaces, based on the STREAMS development
environment, constitute a major portion of this effort.  The service
primitives that make up these interfaces are defined as STREAMS messages that are
transferred between the user and provider of the service.  DLPI is one such
kernel-level interface, and is targeted for STREAMS protocol modules that either
use or provide data link services.  In addition, user programs that wish to
access a STREAMS-based data link provider directly may do so using the putmsg(2)
and getmsg(2) system calls.

Referring to the abstract view of DLPI (@figref{1}), the DLS provider is
configured as a STREAMS driver, and the DLS user accesses the provider using
open(2) to establish a stream to the DLS provider.  The stream acts as a
@cpindex Communication endpoint
communication endpoint between a DLS user and the DLS provider.  After the
stream is created, the DLS user and DLS provider communicate via the messages
presented later in this specification.

DLPI is intended to free data link users from specific knowledge of the
characteristics of the data link provider.  Specifically, the definition of DLPI
hopes to achieve the goal of allowing a DLS user to be implemented independent
of a specific communications medium.  Any data link provider (supporting any
communications medium) that conforms to the DLPI specification may be
substituted beneath the DLS user to provide the data link services.  Support of
a new DLS provider should not require any changes to the implementation of the
DLS user.

@node Modes of Communication
@section Modes of Communication

@menu
* Connection-mode Service (1)::
* Connectionless-mode Service::
* Acknowledged Connectionless-mode Service::
@end menu

@cpindex Connectionless mode
The data link provider interface supports three modes of communication:
connection, connectionless and acknowledged connectionless.  The connection mode
@cpindex Connection mode
is circuit-oriented and enables data to be transferred over a pre-established
connection in a sequenced manner.  Data may be lost or corrupted in this service
mode, however, due to provider-initiated resynchronization or connection aborts.

@cpindex Connectionless mode
The connectionless mode is message-oriented and supports data transfer in
self-contained units with no logical relationship required between units.
Because there is no acknowledgment of each data unit transmission, this service
mode can be unreliable in the most general case.  However, a specific DLS
provider can provide assurance that messages will not be lost, duplicated, or
reordered.

@cpindex Connectionless mode
The acknowledged connectionless mode provides the means by which a data link
user can send data and request the return of data at the same time.  Although
the exchange service is connectionless, in-sequence delivery is guaranteed for
data sent by the initiating station.  The data unit transfer is point-to-point.

@node Connection-mode Service (1)
@subsection Connection-mode Service
@cpindex Connection mode
The connection-mode service is characterized by four phases of communication:
@cpindex Connection establishment
local management, connection establishment, data transfer, and connection
release.

@subsubsection Local Management
This phase enables a DLS user to initialize a stream for use in communication
and establish an identity with the DLS provider.

@subsubsection Connection Establishment
@cpindex Called DLS user
@cpindex Calling DLS user
@cpindex Connection establishment
This phase enables two DLS users to establish a data link connection between
them to exchange data.  One user (the calling DLS user) initiates the connection
@cpindex Connection establishment
establishment procedures, while another user (the called DLS user) waits for
incoming connect requests.  The called DLS user is identified by an address
associated with its stream (as will be discussed shortly).

A called DLS user may either accept or deny a request for a data link
connection.  If the request is accepted, a connection is established between the
DLS users and they enter the data transfer phase.  For both the calling and
called DLS users, only one connection may be established per stream.  Thus, the
@cpindex Communication endpoint
stream is the communication endpoint for a data link connection.  The called DLS
user may choose to accept a connection on the stream where it received the
connect request, or it may open a new stream to the DLS provider and accept the
connection on this new, responding stream.  By accepting the connection on a
separate stream, the initial stream can be designated as a listening stream
through which all connect requests will be processed.  As each request arrives,
@cpindex Communication endpoint
a new stream (communication endpoint) can be opened to handle the connection,
enabling subsequent requests to be queued on a single stream until they can be
processed.

@subsubsection Data Transfer
In this phase, the DLS users are considered peers and may exchange data
simultaneously in both directions over an established data link connection.
Either DLS user may send data to its peer DLS user at any time.  Data sent by a
DLS user is guaranteed to be delivered to the remote user in the order in which
it was sent.

@subsubsection Connection Release
This phase enables either the DLS user, or the DLS provider, to break an
established connection.  The release procedure is considered abortive, so any
data that has not reached the destination user when the connection is released
may be discarded by the DLS provider.

@node Connectionless-mode Service
@subsection Connectionless-mode Service
@cpindex Connection establishment
@cpindex Connectionless mode
The connectionless mode service does not use the connection establishment and
@cpindex Connection mode
release phases of the connection-mode service.  The local management phase is
still required to initialize a stream.  Once initialized, however, the
connectionless data transfer phase is immediately entered.  Because there is
no established connection, however, the connectionless data transfer phase
requires the DLS user to identify the destination of each data unit to be
transferred.  The destination DLS user is identified by the address associated
with that user (as will be discussed shortly).

Connectionless data transfer does not guarantee that data units will be
delivered to the destination user in the order in which they were sent.
Furthermore, it does not guarantee that a given data unit will reach the
destination DLS user, although a given DLS provider may provide assurance that
data will not be lost.

@node Acknowledged Connectionless-mode Service
@subsection Acknowledged Connectionless-mode Service
@cpindex Connection establishment
@cpindex Connectionless mode
The acknowledged connectionless mode service also does not use the connection
@cpindex Connection mode
establishment and release phases of the connection-mode service.  The local
management phase is still required to initialize a stream.  Once initialized, the
acknowledged connectionless data transfer phase is immediately entered.

Acknowledged connectionless data transfer guarantees that data units will be
delivered to the destination user in the order in which they were sent.  A data
link user entity can send a data unit to the destination DLS User, request a
previously prepared data unit from the destination DLS User, or exchange data
units.

@node DLPI Addressing
@section DLPI Addressing

@menu
* Physical Attachment Identification::
* Data Link User Identification::
@end menu

Each user of DLPI must establish an identity to communicate with other data link
users.  This identity consists of two pieces.  First, the DLS user must somehow
identify the physical medium over which it will communicate.  This is
particularly evident on systems that are attached to multiple physical
media.  Second, the DLS user must register itself with the DLS provider so that
the provider can deliver protocol data units destined for that user.  The
following figure illustrates the components of this identification approach,
which are explained below.

@figuresized{dlpi_fig2,2,Data Link Addressing Components,4in}

@node Physical Attachment Identification
@subsection Physical Attachment Identification

The physical point of attachment (PPA in @figref{2}) is the point at which a
system attaches itself to a physical communications medium.  All communication
on that physical medium funnels through the PPA.  On systems where a DLS
provider supports more than one physical medium, the DLS user must identify
which medium it will communicate through.  A PPA is identified by a unique PPA
identifier .  For media that support physical layer multiplexing of multiple
channels over a single physical medium (such as the B and D channels of ISDN),
the PPA identifier must identify the specific channel over which communication
will occur.

Two styles of DLS provider are defined by DLPI, distinguished by the way they
enable a DLS user to choose a particular PPA.  The style 1 provider assigns a
PPA based on the major/minor device the DLS user opened.  One possible
implementation of a style 1 driver would reserve a major device for each PPA the
data link driver would support.  This would allow the STREAMS clone open feature
to be used for each PPA configured.  This style of provider is appropriate when
few PPAs will be supported.

If the number of PPAs a DLS provider will support is large, a style 2 provider
implementation is more suitable.  The style 2 provider requires a DLS user to
explicitly identify the desired PPA using a special attach service primitive.
For a style 2 driver, the open(2) creates a stream between the DLS user and DLS
provider, and the attach primitive then associates a particular PPA with that
stream.  The format of the PPA identifier is specific to the DLS provider, and
should be described in the provider-specific addendum documentation.

DLPI provides a mechanism to get and/or modify the physical address.  The
primitives to handle these functions are described in @ref{Optional Primitives
to perform Essential Management Functions}.  The physical address value can be
modified in a post-attached state.  This would modify the value for all streams
for that provider for a particular PPA.  The physical address cannot be modified
if even a single stream for that PPA is in the bound state.

The DLS User uses the supported primitives
(DL_@-ATTACH_@-REQ,
@prindex DL_ATTACH_REQ
DL_@-BIND_@-REQ,
@prindex DL_BIND_REQ
DL_@-ENABMULTI_@-REQ,
@prindex DL_ENABMULTI_REQ
DL_@-PRO@-MISC@-ON_@-REQ)
@prindex DL_PROMISCON_REQ
to define a set of enabled physical and SAP address components on a per Stream
basis.  It is invalid for a DLS Provider to ever send upstream a data message
for which the DLS User on that stream has not requested.  The burden is on the
provider to enforce by any means that it chooses, the isolation of SAP and
physical address space effects on a per-stream basis.

@node Data Link User Identification
@subsection Data Link User Identification

A data link user's identity is established by associating it with a data link
service access point (DLSAP), which is the point through which the user will
communicate with the data link provider.  A DLSAP is identified by a DLSAP
address.

The DLSAP address identifies a particular data link service access point that is
@cpindex Communication endpoint
associated with a stream (communication endpoint).  A bind service primitive
enables a DLS user to either choose a specific DLSAP by specifying its DLSAP
address, or to determine the DLSAP associated with a stream by retrieving the
bound DLSAP address.  This DLSAP address can then be used by other DLS users to
access a specific DLS user.  The format of the DLSAP address is specific to the
DLS provider, and should be described in the provider-specific addendum
documentation.  However, DLPI provides a mechanism for decomposing the DLSAP
address into component pieces.  The
DL_@-INFO_@-ACK
@prindex DL_INFO_ACK
primitive returns the length of the SAP component of the DLSAP address, along
with the total length of the DLSAP address.

Certain DLS Providers require the capability of binding on multiple DLSAP
addresses.  This can be achieved through subsequent binding of DLSAP addresses.
DLPI supports peer and hierarchical binding of DLSAPs.  When the User requests
peer addressing, the DLSAP specified in a subsequent bind may be used in lieu of
the DLSAP bound in the
DL_@-BIND_@-REQ.
@prindex DL_BIND_REQ
This will allow for a choice to be made between a number of DLSAPs on a stream
when determining traffic based on DLSAP values.  An example of this would be to
specify various ether_type values as DLSAPs.  The
DL_@-BIND_@-REQ,
@prindex DL_BIND_REQ
for example, could be issued with ether_type value of IP, and a subsequent bind
could be issued with ether type value of ARP.  The Provider may now multiplex
off of the ether_type field and allow for either IP or ARP traffic to be sent up
this stream.

When the DLS User requests hierarchical binding, the subsequent bind will
specify a DLSAP that will be used in addition to the DLSAP bound using a
DL_@-BIND_@-REQ.
@prindex DL_BIND_REQ
This will allow additional information to be specified, that will be used in a
header or used for de-multiplexing.  An example of this would be to use
hierarchical bind to specify the OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier) to be
used by SNAP.

If a DLS Provider supports peer subsequent bind operations, the first SAP that
is bound is used as the source SAP when there is ambiguity.

DLPI supports the ability to associate several streams with a single DLSAP,
@cpindex Communication endpoint
where each stream may be a unique data link connection endpoint.  However, not
all DLS providers can support such configurations because some DLS providers may
have no mechanism beyond the DLSAP address for distinguishing multiple
connections.  In such cases, the provider will restrict the DLS user to one
stream per DLSAP.

@node The Connection Management Stream
@section The Connection Management Stream

@cpindex Connection management stream
@cpindex Connection mode
The earlier description of the connection-mode service assumed that a DLS user
bound a DLSAP to the stream it would use to receive connect requests.  In some
instances, however, it is expected that a given service may be accessed through
any one of several DLSAPs.  To handle this scenario, a separate stream would be
required for each possible destination DLSAP, regardless of whether any DLS user
actually requested a connection to that DLSAP.  Obvious resource problems can
result in this scenario.

To obviate the need for tying up system resources for all possible destination
@cpindex Connection management stream
DLSAPs, a "connection management stream" utility is defined in DLPI.  A
@cpindex Connection management stream
connection management stream is one that receives any connect requests that are
not destined for currently bound DLSAPs capable of receiving connect
indications.  With this mechanism, a special listener can handle incoming
@cpindex Connection management stream
connect requests intended for a set of DLSAPs by opening a connection management
stream to the DLS provider that will retrieve all connect requests arriving
through a particular PPA.  In the model, then, there may be a connection
management stream per PPA.

The various features of the DLPI interface are defined in terms of the services
provided by the DLS provider, and the individual primitives that may flow
between the DLS user and DLS provider.

@cpindex Connectionless mode
The data link provider interface supports three modes of service: connection,
@cpindex Connection mode
connectionless and acknowledged connectionless.  The connection mode is
circuit-oriented and enables data to be transferred over an established
connection in a sequenced manner.  The connectionless mode is message-oriented
and supports data transfer in self-contained units with no logical relationship
required between units.  The acknowledged connectionless mode is
message-oriented and guarantees that data units will be delivered to the
destination user in the order in which they were sent.  This specification also
defines a set of local management functions that apply to all modes of service.

The XID and TEST services that are supported by DLPI are listed below.  The DLS
User can issue an XID or TEST request to the DLS Provider.  The Provider will
transmit an XID or TEST frame to the peer DLS Provider.  On receiving a
response, the DLS Provider sends a confirmation primitive to the DLS User.
On receiving an XID or TEST frame from the peer DLS Provider, the local DLS
Provider sends up an XID or TEST indication primitive to the DLS User.  The User
must respond with an XID or TEST response frame to the Provider.

The services are tabulated below and described more fully in the remainder of
this section.

@cpindex Connection establishment
The connection establishment service establishes a data link connection between

one data link connection is allowed on each stream.

@node Normal Connection Establishment
@subsubsection Normal Connection Establishment
@cpindex Called DLS user
@cpindex Calling DLS user
@cpindex Connection establishment
In the connection establishment model, the calling DLS user initiates connection
establishment, while the called DLS user waits for incoming requests.
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-REQ
@prindex DL_CONNECT_REQ
requests that the DLS provider establish a connection.
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-IND
@prindex DL_CONNECT_IND
informs the called DLS user of the request, which may be accepted using
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-RES.
@prindex DL_CONNECT_RES
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-CON
@prindex DL_CONNECT_CON
informs the calling DLS user that the connection has been established.

@cpindex Connection establishment
The normal sequence of messages is illustrated in the following figure.

@figuresized{dlpi_fi12,12,Message Flow: Successful Connection Establishment,4in}

Once the connection is established, the DLS users may exchange user data using
DL_@-DATA_@-REQ
@prindex DL_DATA_REQ
and DL_@-DATA_@-IND.
@prindex DL_DATA_IND

The DLS user may accept an incoming connect request on either the stream where
the connect indication arrived or an alternate, responding stream.  The
responding stream is indicated by a token in the
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-RES.
@prindex DL_CONNECT_RES
This token is a value associated with the responding stream, and is obtained by
issuing a
DL_@-TOK@-EN_@-REQ
@prindex DL_TOKEN_REQ
on that stream.  The DLS provider responds to this request by generating a token
for the stream and returning it to the DLS user in a
DL_@-TOK@-EN_@-ACK.
@prindex DL_TOKEN_ACK
The normal sequence of messages for obtaining a token is illustrated in the
following figure.

@figuresized{dlpi_fi13,13,Message Flow: Token Retrieval,4in}

@cpindex Called DLS user
@cpindex Connection establishment
In the typical connection establishment scenario, the called DLS user processes
one connect indication at a time, accepting the connection on another stream.
Once the user responds to the current connect indication, the next connect
indication (if any) can be processed.  DLPI also enables the called DLS user to
multi-thread incoming connect indications.  The user can receive multiple
connect indications before responding to any of them.  This enables the DLS user
to establish priority schemes on incoming connect requests.

@node Connection Establishment Rejections
@subsubsection Connection Establishment Rejections
@cpindex Connection establishment
In certain situations, the connection establishment request cannot be completed.
The following paragraphs describe the occasions under which
DL_@-DIS@-CON@-NECT_@-REQ
@prindex DL_DISCONNECT_REQ
and DL_@-DIS@-CON@-NECT_@-IND
@prindex DL_DISCONNECT_IND
primitives will flow during connection establishment, causing the connect

@node Data Transfer Service
@subsection Data Transfer Service
@cpindex Called DLS user
@cpindex Connection mode
The connection-mode data transfer service provides for the exchange of user data
in either direction or in both directions simultaneously between DLS users.  Data
is transmitted in logical groups called data link service data units (DLSDUs).
The DLS provider preserves both the sequence and boundaries of DLSDUs as they
are transmitted.

Normal data transfer is neither acknowledged nor confirmed.  It is up to the DLS
users, if they so choose, to implement a confirmation protocol.

Each DL_@-DATA_@-REQ
@prindex DL_DATA_REQ
primitive conveys a DLSDU from the local DLS user to the DLS provider.
Similarly, each
DL_@-DATA_@-IND
@prindex DL_DATA_IND
primitive conveys a DLSDU from the DLS provider to the remote DLS user.  The
normal flow of messages is illustrated in the figure below.

@figuresized{dlpi_fi19,19,Message Flow: Normal Data Transfer,4in}

@node Connection Release Service
@subsection Connection Release Service
The connection release service provides for the DLS users or the DLS provider to
initiate the connection release.  Connection release is an abortive operation,
and any data in transit (has not been delivered to the DLS user) may be
discarded.

DL_@-DIS@-CON@-NECT_@-REQ
@prindex DL_DISCONNECT_REQ
requests that a connection be released.
DL_@-DIS@-CON@-NECT_@-IND
@prindex DL_DISCONNECT_IND
informs the DLS user that a connection has been released.  Normally, one DLS
user requests disconnection and the DLS provider issues an indication of the
ensuing release to the other DLS user, as illustrated by the message flow in the
following figure.

@figuresized{dlpi_fi20,20,Message Flow: DLS User-Invoked Connection Release,4in}

DL_@-DIS@-CON@-NECT_@-IND.

@figuresized{dlpi_fi22,22,Message Flow: DLS Provider Invoked Connection Release,4in}

The next figure illustrates that when the DLS provider and the local DLS user

@figuresized{dlpi_fi23,23,Message Flow: Simultaneous DLS User & DLS Provider Invoked Connection Release,4in}

@node Reset Service
@subsection Reset Service
The reset service may be used by the DLS user to resynchronize the use of a data
link connection, or by the DLS provider to report detected loss of data
unrecoverable within the data link service.

Invocation of the reset service will unblock the flow of DLSDUs if the data link
connection is congested; DLSDUs may be discarded by the DLS provider.  The DLS
user or users that did not invoke the reset will be notified that a reset has
occurred.  A reset may require a recovery procedure to be performed by the DLS
users.

The interaction between each DLS user and the DLS provider will be one of the
following:

@itemize @bullet
@item a
DL_@-RE@-SET_@-REQ from the DLS user, followed by a
@prindex DL_RESET_REQ
DL_@-RE@-SET_@-CON from the DLS provider;
@prindex DL_RESET_CON
@item a
DL_@-RE@-SET_@-IND from the DLS provider, followed by a
@prindex DL_RESET_IND
DL_@-RE@-SET_@-RES from the DLS user.
@prindex DL_RESET_RES
@end itemize

The DL_@-RE@-SET_@-REQ
@prindex DL_RESET_REQ
acts as a synchronization mark in the stream of DLSDUs that are transmitted by
the issuing DLS user; the
DL_@-RE@-SET_@-IND
@prindex DL_RESET_IND
acts as a synchronization mark in the stream of DLSDUs that are received by the
peer DLS user.  Similarly, the
DL_@-RE@-SET_@-RES
@prindex DL_RESET_RES
acts as a synchronization mark in the stream of DLSDUs that are transmitted by
the responding DLS user; the
DL_@-RE@-SET_@-CON
@prindex DL_RESET_CON
acts as a synchronization mark in the stream of DLSDUs that are received by the
DLS user which originally issued the reset.

The resynchronizing properties of the reset service are that:

@itemize @bullet

@item No DLSDU transmitted by the DLS user before the synchronization mark in
that transmitted stream will be delivered to the other DLS user after the
synchronization mark in that received stream.

@item The DLS provider will discard all DLSDUs submitted before the issuing of
the
DL_@-RE@-SET_@-REQ
@prindex DL_RESET_REQ
that have not been delivered to the peer DLS user when the DLS provider issues
the
DL_@-RE@-SET_@-IND.
@prindex DL_RESET_IND

@item The DLS provider will discard all DLSDUs submitted before the issuing of
the
DL_@-RE@-SET_@-RES
@prindex DL_RESET_IND
that have not been delivered to the initiator of the
DL_@-RE@-SET_@-REQ
@prindex DL_RESET_REQ
when the DLS provider issues the
DL_@-RE@-SET_@-CON.
@prindex DL_RESET_CON

@item No DLSDU transmitted by a DLS user after the synchronization mark in that
transmitted stream will be delivered to the other DLS user before the
synchronization mark in that received stream.

@end itemize

to the DLS User.  The DLS User must respond with an XID or TEST response
primitive.

If the DLS User requested automatic handling of the XID or TEST response, at

The kernel-level interface to the data link layer defines a STREAMS-based
message interface between the provider of the data link service (DLS provider)
and the consumer of the data link service (DLS user).  STREAMS provides the
mechanism in which DLPI primitives may be passed between the DLS user and DLS
provider.

Before DLPI primitives can be passed between the DLS user and the DLS provider,
the DLS user must establish a stream to the DLS provider using open(2).  The DLS
provider must therefore be configured as a STREAMS driver.  When interactions
between the DLS user and DLS provider have completed, the stream may be closed.

The STREAMS messages used to transport data link service primitives across the
interface have one of the following formats:

@itemize @bullet
@item One M_PROTO message block followed by zero or more M_DATA blocks.  The
M_PROTO message block contains the data link layer service primitive type and all
relevant parameters associated with the primitive.  The M_DATA block(s) contain
any DLS user data that might be associated with the service primitive.
@item One M_PCPROTO message block containing the data link layer service
primitive type and all relevant parameters associated with the service primitive.
@item One or more M_DATA message blocks conveying user data.
@end itemize

The information contained in the M_PROTO or M_PCPROTO message blocks must begin
on a byte boundary that is appropriate for structure alignment (e.g.
word-aligned on the AT&T 3B2 Computer).  STREAMS will allocate buffers that
begin on such a boundary.  However, these message blocks may contain information
whose representation is described by a length and an offset within the block.
An example is the DLSAP address (dl_addr_length and dl_addr_offset) in the
DL_@-BIND_@-ACK
@prindex DL_BIND_ACK
primitive.  The offset of such information within the message block is not
guaranteed to be properly aligned for casting the appropriate data type (such as
an int or a structure).

@ref{Allowable Sequence of DLPI Primitives}, defines the sequence in which DLPI
primitives can be passed between DLS user and DLS provider, and @ref{Precedence
of DLPI Primitives}, summarizes the precedence rules associated with each
primitive for ordering the primitives on the DLS provider and DLS user queues.

The following sections describe the format of the primitives that support the
services described in the previous section.  The primitives are grouped into
four general categories for presentation:

@itemize @bullet
@item Local Management Service Primitives
@item Connection-mode Service Primitives
@cpindex Connection mode
@item Connectionless-mode Service Primitives
@cpindex Connectionless mode
@item Acknowledged Connectionless-mode Service Primitives

@cpindex Connectionless mode
This section describes the local management service primitives that are common
to the connection, connectionless and acknowledged connectionless service modes.
These primitives support the Information Reporting, Attach, Bind,
enabling/disabling of multicast addresses and turning on/off the promiscuous
mode.  Once a stream has been opened by a DLS user, these primitives initialize
the stream, preparing it for use.

@node PPA Initialization / De-initialization
@subsection PPA Initialization / De-initialization
The PPA associated with each stream must be initialized before the DLS provider
can transfer data over the medium.  The initialization and de-initialization of
the PPA is a network management issue, but DLPI must address the issue because
of the impact such actions will have on a DLS user.  More specifically, DLPI
requires the DLS provider to initialize the PPA associated with a stream at some
point before it completes the processing of the
DL_@-BIND_@-REQ.
@prindex DL_BIND_REQ
Guidelines for initialization and de-initialization of a PPA by a DLS provider
are presented here.

A DLS provider may initialize a PPA using the following methods:

@itemize @bullet
@item pre-initialized by some network management mechanism before the
DL_@-BIND_@-REQ
@prindex DL_BIND_REQ
is received; or
@item automatic initialization on receipt of a
DL_@-BIND_@-REQ
@prindex DL_BIND_REQ
or
DL_@-ATTACH_@-REQ.
@prindex DL_ATTACH_REQ
@end itemize

A specific DLS provider may support either of these methods, or possibly some
combination of the two, but the method implemented has no impact on the DLS user.
From the DLS user's viewpoint, the PPA is guaranteed to be initialized on
receipt of a
DL_@-BIND_@-ACK.
@prindex DL_BIND_ACK
For automatic initialization, this implies that the
DL_@-BIND_@-ACK
@prindex DL_BIND_ACK
may not be issued until the initialization has completed.

If pre-initialization has not been performed and/or automatic initialization
fails, the DLS provider will fail the
DL_@-BIND_@-REQ.
@prindex DL_BIND_REQ
Two errors,
DL_@-INITFAILED
@peindex DL_INITFAILED
and
DL_@-NOTINIT,
@peindex DL_NOTINIT
may be returned in the
DL_@-ERROR_@-ACK
@prindex DL_ERROR_ACK
response to a
DL_@-BIND_@-REQ
@prindex DL_BIND_REQ
if PPA initialization fails.
DL_@-INITFAILED
@peindex DL_INITFAILED
is returned when a DLS provider supports automatic PPA initialization, but the
initialization attempt failed.
DL_@-NOTINIT
@peindex DL_NOTINIT
is returned when the DLS provider requires pre-initialization, but the PPA is
not initialized before the
DL_@-BIND_@-REQ
@prindex DL_BIND_REQ
is received.

A DLS provider may handle PPA de-initialization using the following methods:

@itemize @bullet
@item automatic de-initialization upon receipt of the final
DL_@-DETACH_@-REQ
@prindex DL_DETACH_REQ
(for style 2 providers) or
DL_@-UN@-BIND_@-REQ
@prindex DL_UNBIND_REQ
(for style 1 providers), or upon closing of the last stream associated with the
PPA;
@item automatic de-initialization after expiration of a timer following the last
DL_@-DETACH_@-REQ,
@prindex DL_DETACH_REQ
DL_@-UN@-BIND_@-REQ,
@prindex DL_UNBIND_REQ
or close as appropriate; or
@item no automatic de-initialization; administrative intervention is required to
de-initialize the PPA at some point after it is no longer being accessed.
@end itemize

A specific DLS provider may support any of these methods, or possibly some
combination of them, but the method implemented has no impact on the DLS user.
From the DLS user's viewpoint, the PPA is guaranteed to be initialized and
available for transmission until it closes or unbinds the stream associated with
the PPA.

DLS provider-specific addendum documentation should describe the method chosen
for PPA initialization and de-initialization.

@subsubheading Parameters

@vtable @var
@item dl_primitive
conveys
DL_@-INFO_@-ACK.
@prindex DL_INFO_ACK

@item dl_max_sdu
conveys the maximum number of bytes that may be transmitted in a DLSDU.  This
value must be a positive integer that is greater than or equal to the value of
dl_min_sdu.

@item dl_min_sdu
conveys the minimum number of bytes that may be transmitted in a DLSDU.  The
value is never less than one.

@item dl_addr_length
conveys the length, in bytes, of the provider's DLSAP address.  In the case of a
hierarchical subsequent bind, the length returned is the total length i.e.
Physical address + SAP + subsequent address length.

@item dl_mac_type
conveys the type of medium supported by this DLPI stream.  Possible values
include:

@table @var
@item DL_@-CSMACD
@pvindex DL_CSMACD
The medium is Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (ISO8802/3).
@item DL_@-TPB
@pvindex DL_TPB
The medium is Token-Passing Bus (ISO 8802/4).
@item DL_@-TPR
@pvindex DL_TPR
The medium is Token-Passing Ring (ISO 8802/5).
@item DL_@-METRO
@pvindex DL_METRO
The medium is Metro Net (ISO 8802/6).

@item DL_@-CHAR
@pvindex DL_CHAR
The medium is a character synchronous communication line (e.g.  BISYNC).
@item DL_@-CTCA
@pvindex DL_CTCA
The medium is a channel-to-channel adapter.
@item DL_@-FDDI
@pvindex DL_FDDI
The medium is a Fiber Distributed Data Interface.
@item DL_@-OTHER
@pvindex DL_OTHER
Any other medium not listed above.
@end table

@item dl_reserved
is a reserved field whose value must be set to zero.

@item dl_current_state
conveys the state of the DLPI interface for the stream when the DLS provider
issued this acknowledgment.  See @ref{Allowable Sequence of DLPI Primitives},
for a list of DLPI states and an
explanation of each.
@item dl_sap_length
indicates the current length of the SAP component of the DLSAP address.  It may
have a negative, zero or positive value.  A positive value indicates the
ordering of the SAP and PHYSICAL component within the DLSAP address as SAP
component followed by PHYSICAL component.  A negative value indicates PHYSICAL
followed by the SAP.  A zero value indicates that no SAP has yet been bound.
The absolute value of the dl_sap_length provides the length of the SAP component
within the DLSAP address.
@item dl_service_mode
if returned before the
DL_@-BIND_@-REQ
@prindex DL_BIND_REQ
@cpindex Connection mode
is processed, this conveys which service modes (connection-mode,
@cpindex Connectionless mode
connectionless-mode or acknowledged connectionless-mode, or any combination of
these modes) the DLS provider can support.  It contains a bit-mask specifying
one or more than one of the following values:

@table @var
@item DL_@-CODLS
@pvindex DL_CODLS
connection-oriented data link service;
@item DL_@-CLDLS
@pvindex DL_CLDLS
@cpindex Connectionless mode
connectionless data link service;
@item DL_@-ACLDLS
@pvindex DL_ACLDLS
@cpindex Connectionless mode
acknowledged connectionless data link service;
@end table

Once a specific service mode has been bound to the stream, this field returns
that specific service mode.

@item dl_qos_length
conveys the length, in bytes, of the negotiated/selected values of the quality
of service (QOS) parameters.  @ref{Quality of Data Link Service}, describes
quality of service and its associated parameters completely.  For
@cpindex Connection mode
connection-mode service, the returned values are those agreed during
@cpindex Connectionless mode
negotiation.  For connectionless-mode service, the values are those currently
selected by the DLS user.  If quality of service has not yet been negotiated,
default values will be returned; these values correspond to those that will be
@cpindex Connection mode
applied by the DLS provider on a connect request in connection-mode service, or
those that will be applied to each data unit transmission in connectionless-mode
@cpindex Connection mode
service.  If the DLS provider supports both connection-mode and
connectionless-mode services but the DLS user has not yet bound a specific
@cpindex Connection mode
service mode, the DLS provider may return either connection-mode or
@cpindex Connectionless mode
connectionless-mode QOS parameter values.

The QOS values are conveyed in the structures defined in @ref{QOS Data
Structures}.  For any parameter the DLS provider does not support or cannot
determine, the corresponding entry will be set to
DL_@-UNKNOWN.
@pvindex DL_UNKNOWN
If the DLS provider does not support any QOS parameters, this length field will
be set to zero.

@item dl_qos_offset
conveys the offset from the beginning of the M_PCPROTO block where the current
quality of service parameters begin.

@item dl_qos_range_length
@cpindex Calling DLS user
conveys the length, in bytes, of the available range of QOS parameter values
@cpindex Connection mode
supported by the DLS provider.  For connection-mode service, this is the range
@cpindex Connectionless mode
available to the calling DLS user in a connect request.  For connectionless-mode,
this is the range available for each data unit transmission.  If the DLS
@cpindex Connection mode
provider supports both connection-mode and connectionless-mode services but the
DLS user has not yet bound a specific service mode, the DLS provider may return
@cpindex Connection mode
either connection-mode or connectionless-mode QOS parameter values.  The range
of available QOS values is conveyed in the structures defined in @ref{QOS Data
Structures}.  For any parameter the DLS provider does not support or cannot
determine, the corresponding entry will be set to
DL_@-UNKNOWN.
@pvindex DL_UNKNOWN
If the DLS provider does not support any QOS parameters, this length field will
be set to zero.

@item dl_qos_range_offset
conveys the offset from the beginning of the M_PCPROTO block where the available
range of quality of service parameters begins.

@item dl_provider_style
conveys the style of DLS provider associated with the DLPI stream
(@pxref{Physical Attachment Identification}).  The following provider classes
are defined:

@table @var
@item DL_@-STYLE1
@pvindex DL_STYLE1
The PPA is implicitly attached to the DLPI stream by opening the
appropriate major/minor device number.
@item DL_@-STYLE2
@pvindex DL_STYLE2
The DLS user must explicitly attach a PPA to the DLPI stream using
DL_@-ATTACH_@-REQ.
@prindex DL_ATTACH_REQ
@end table

DLS users implemented in a protocol-independent manner must access this
parameter to determine whether the DLS attach service must be invoked explicitly.

@item dl_addr_offset
conveys the offset of the address that is bound to the associated stream.  If the
DLS user issues a
DL_@-INFO_@-REQ
@prindex DL_INFO_REQ
prior to binding a DLSAP, the value of dl_addr_len will be 0 and consequently
indicate that there has been no address bound.

@item dl_version
indicates the current version of the DLPI that's supported.

@item dl_brdcst_addr_length
indicates the length of the physical broadcast address.

@item dl_brdcst_addr_offset
indicates the offset of the physical broadcast address from the beginning of the
M_PCPROTO block.

@item dl_growth
conveys a growth field for future use.  The value of this field will be zero.

@end vtable

@subsubheading State
The message is valid in any state in response to a
DL_@-INFO_@-REQ.
@prindex DL_INFO_REQ

@subsubheading New State
The resulting state is unchanged.


@page
@node Message DL_ATTACH_REQ (dl_attach_req_t)
@subsection Message DL_ATTACH_REQ (dl_attach_req_t)
@prindex DL_ATTACH_REQ
@tpindex dl_attach_req_t
Requests the DLS provider associate a physical point of attachment (PPA) with a
stream.
DL_@-ATTACH_@-REQ
@prindex DL_ATTACH_REQ
is needed for style 2 DLS providers to identify the physical medium over which
communication will transpire.  The request may not be issued to a style 1 DLS
provider; doing so may cause errors.

The DLS provider may initialize the physical line on receipt of this primitive
or the
DL_@-BIND_@-REQ.
@prindex DL_BIND_REQ
Otherwise, the line must be initialized through some management mechanism before
this request is issued by the DLS user.  Either way, the physical link must be
initialized and ready for use on successful completion of the
DL_@-BIND_@-REQ.
@prindex DL_BIND_REQ

@subsubheading Message Format
The message consists of one M_PROTO message block, which contains the following
structure.

@example

@tpindex dl_attach_req_t
@end example

@subsubheading Parameters

@vtable @var
@item dl_primitive
conveys
DL_@-ATTACH_@-REQ.
@prindex DL_ATTACH_REQ

@item dl_ppa
conveys the identifier of the physical point of attachment to be associated with
the stream.  The format of the identifier is provider-specific, and it must
contain sufficient information to distinguish the desired PPA from all possible
PPAs on a system.

At a minimum, this must include identification of the physical medium over
which communication will transpire.  For media that multiplex multiple channels
over a single physical medium, this identifier should also specify a specific
channel to be used for communication(where each channel on a physical medium is
associated with a separate PPA).

Because of the provider-specific nature of this value, DLS user software that is
to be protocol independent should avoid hard-coding the PPA identifier.  The DLS
user should retrieve the necessary PPA identifier from some other entity (such
as a management entity) and insert it without inspection into the
DL_@-ATTACH_@-REQ.

@node Message DL_BIND_REQ (dl_bind_req_t)
@subsection Message DL_BIND_REQ (dl_bind_req_t)
@prindex DL_BIND_REQ
@tpindex dl_bind_req_t
Requests the DLS provider bind a DLSAP to the stream.  The DLS user must
identify the address of the DLSAP to be bound to the stream.  For
@cpindex Connection mode
connection-mode service, the DLS user also indicates whether it will accept
incoming connection requests on the stream.  Finally, the request directs the
DLS provider to activate the stream associated with the DLSAP.

A stream is viewed as active when the DLS provider may transmit and receive
protocol data units destined to or originating from the stream.  The PPA
associated with each stream must be initialized upon completion of the
processing of the
DL_@-BIND_@-REQ
@prindex DL_BIND_REQ
(@pxref{PPA Initialization / De-initialization}).  More specifically, the DLS
user is ensured that the PPA is initialized when the
DL_@-BIND_@-ACK is
@prindex DL_BIND_ACK
received.  If the PPA cannot be initialized, the
DL_@-BIND_@-REQ will
@prindex DL_BIND_REQ
fail.

@cpindex Connection management stream
A stream may be bound as a "connection management" stream, such that it will
receive all connect requests that arrive through a given PPA (@pxref{The
Connection Management Stream}).  In this case, the dl_sap will be ignored.

@subsubheading Message Format
The message consists of one M_PROTO message block, which contains the following
structure.

@example
typedef struct @{
        ulong dl_primitive;
        ulong dl_sap;
        ulong dl_max_conind;
        ushort dl_service_mode;
        ushort dl_conn_mgmt;
        ulong dl_xidtest_flg;
@} dl_bind_req_t;
@tpindex dl_bind_req_t
@end example

@subsubheading Parameters

@vtable @var
@item dl_primitive
conveys
DL_@-BIND_@-REQ.
@prindex DL_BIND_REQ

@item dl_sap
conveys sufficient information to identify the DLSAP that will be bound to the
DLPI stream (@pxref{DLPI Addressing}, for a description of DLSAP addresses).
The format of this information is specific to a given DLS provider, and may
contain the full DLSAP address or some portion of that address sufficient to
uniquely identify the DLSAP in question.  The full address of the bound DLSAP
will be returned in the
DL_@-BIND_@-ACK.
@prindex DL_BIND_ACK

The following rules are used by the DLS provider when binding a DLSAP address.

@itemize @bullet
@item The DLS provider must define and manage its DLSAP address space.

@item DLPI allows the same DLSAP to be bound to multiple streams, but a given
DLS provider may need to restrict its address space to allow one stream per
DLSAP.

@item The DLS provider may not be able to bind the specified DLSAP address for
the following reasons:

@enumerate
@item the DLS provider may statically associate a specific DLSAP with each
stream; or
@item the DLS provider may only support one stream per DLSAP and the DLS user
attempted to bind a DLSAP that was already bound to another stream.
@end enumerate

In case (1), the value of dl_sap is ignored by the DLS provider and the
DL_@-BIND_@-ACK
@prindex DL_BIND_ACK
returns the DLSAP address that is already associated with the stream.  In case
(2), if the DLS provider cannot bind the given DLSAP to the stream, it may
attempt to choose an alternate DLSAP and return that on the
DL_@-BIND_@-ACK.  If
@prindex DL_BIND_ACK
an alternate DLSAP cannot be chosen, the DLS provider will return a
DL_@-ERROR_@-ACK
@prindex DL_ERROR_ACK
and set dl_errno to
DL_@-NOADDR.
@peindex DL_NOADDR
@end itemize

Because of the provider-specific nature of the DLSAP address, DLS user software
that is to be protocol independent should avoid hard-coding this value.  The DLS
user should retrieve the necessary DLSAP address from some other entity (such as
a management entity or higher layer protocol entity) and insert it without
inspection into the
DL_@-BIND_@-REQ.
@prindex DL_BIND_REQ

@item dl_max_conind
conveys the maximum number of outstanding
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-IND messages allowed on the
@prindex DL_CONNECT_IND
DLPI stream.  If the value is zero, the stream cannot accept any
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-IND
@prindex DL_CONNECT_IND
messages.  If greater than zero, the DLS user will accept

up to the given value before having to respond with a
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-RES or a
@prindex DL_CONNECT_RES
DL_@-DIS@-CON@-NECT_@-REQ (@pxref{Multi-threaded Connection Establishment}, for details
@prindex DL_CONNECT_REQ
on how this value is used to support multi-threaded connect processing).  The
DLS provider may not be able to support the value supplied in dl_max_conind, as
specified by the following rules.

@itemize @bullet
@item If the provider cannot support the specified number of outstanding connect
indications, it should set the value down to a number it can support.

@item Only one stream that is bound to the indicated DLSAP may have an allowed
number of maximum outstanding connect indications greater than zero.  If a
DL_@-BIND_@-REQ
@prindex DL_BIND_REQ
specifies a value greater than zero, but another stream has already bound itself
to the DLSAP with a value greater than zero, the DLS provider will fail the
request, setting dl_errno to
DL_@-BOUND on the
@peindex DL_BOUND
DL_@-ERROR_@-ACK.
@prindex DL_ERROR_ACK

@item If a stream with dl_max_conind greater than zero is used to accept a
connection, the stream will be found busy during the duration of the connection,
and no other streams may be bound to the same DLSAP with a value of
dl_max_conind greater than zero.  This restriction prevents more than one stream
bound to the same DLSAP from receiving connect indications and accepting
connections.  Accepting a connection on such a stream is only allowed if there
is just a single outstanding connect indication being processed.

@item A DLS user should always be able to request a dl_max_conind value of zero,
since this indicates to the DLS provider that the stream will only be used to
originate connect requests.

@item A stream with a negotiated value of dl_max_conind that is greater than
zero may not originate connect requests.

@end itemize

@cpindex Connectionless mode
This field is ignored in connectionless-mode service.

@item dl_service_mode
conveys the desired mode of service for this stream, and may contain one of the
following:

@table @var
@item DL_@-CODLS
@pvindex DL_CODLS
connection-oriented data link service;
@item DL_@-CLDLS
@pvindex DL_CLDLS
@cpindex Connectionless mode
connectionless data link service.
@item DL_@-ACLDLS
@pvindex DL_ACLDLS
@cpindex Connectionless mode
acknowledged connectionless data link service.
@end table

If the DLS provider does not support the requested service mode, a
DL_@-ERROR_@-ACK
@prindex DL_ERROR_ACK
will be generated, specifying
DL_@-UNSUPPORTED.
@peindex DL_UNSUPPORTED

@item dl_conn_mgmt
@cpindex Connection management stream
if non-zero, indicates that the stream is the "connection management" stream for
the PPA to which the stream is attached.  When an incoming connect request
arrives, the DLS provider will first look for a stream bound with dl_max_conind
greater than zero that is associated with the destination DLSAP.  If such a
stream is found, the connect indication will be issued on that stream.
Otherwise, the DLS provider will issue the connect indication on the "connection
management" stream for that PPA, if one exists.  Only one "connection
management" stream is allowed per PPA, so an attempt to bind a second
@cpindex Connection management stream
"connection management" stream on a PPA will fail with the DLPI error set to
DL_@-BOUND.  When dl_conn_mgmt is non-zero, the value of dl_sap will be ignored.
@peindex DL_BOUND
@cpindex Connectionless mode
In connectionless-mode service, dl_conn_mgmt is ignored by the DLS provider.

@item dl_xidtest_flg
indicates to the DLS Provider that XID and/or TEST responses for this stream are
to be automatically generated by the DLS Provider.  The DLS Provider will not
generate
DL_@-XID_@-IND and/or
@prindex DL_XID_IND
DL_@-TEST_@-IND, and will error a
@prindex DL_TEST_IND
DL_@-XID_@-REQ and/or
@prindex DL_XID_REQ
DL_@-TEST_@-REQ.
@prindex DL_TEST_REQ
If the DLS Provider does not support automatic handling of XID and/or TEST
responses, a
DL_@-ERROR_@-ACK
@prindex DL_ERROR_ACK
will be generated, specifying
DL_@-NOAUTO,
@peindex DL_NOAUTO
DL_@-NOXIDAUTO or
@peindex DL_NOXIDAUTO
DL_@-NOTESTAUTO.
@peindex DL_NOTESTAUTO
If the Provider receives an XID or TEST request from the DLS User, a

@prindex DL_ERROR_ACK
will be generated specifying
DL_@-XIDAUTO or
@peindex DL_XIDAUTO
DL_@-TESTAUTO
@peindex DL_TESTAUTO
respectively.

The dl_xidtest_flg contains a bit-mask specifying zero or more of the following

@node Multi-threaded Connection Establishment
@subsection Multi-threaded Connection Establishment
@cpindex Called DLS user
@cpindex Calling DLS user
@cpindex Connection establishment
In the connection establishment model, the calling DLS user initiates a request
for a connection, and the called DLS user receives each request and either
accepts or rejects it.  In the simplest form (single threaded), the called DLS
user is passed a connect indication and the DLS provider holds any subsequent
indications until a response for the current outstanding indication is received.
At most one connect indication is outstanding at any time.

DLPI also enables a called DLS user to multi-thread connect indications and
responses.  This capability is desirable, for example, when imposing a priority
scheme on all DLS users attempting to establish a connection.  The DLS provider
will pass all connect indications to the called DLS user (up to some
pre-established limit as set by
DL_@-BIND_@-REQ
@prindex DL_BIND_REQ
and
DL_@-BIND_@-ACK).
@prindex DL_BIND_ACK
The called DLS user may then respond to the requests in any order.

To support multi-threading, a correlation value is needed to associate responses
with the appropriate connect indication.  A correlation value is contained in
each
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-IND,
@prindex DL_CONNECT_IND
and the DLS user must use this value in the
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-RES
@prindex DL_CONNECT_RES
or
DL_@-DIS@-CON@-NECT_@-REQ
@prindex DL_DISCONNECT_REQ
primitive used to accept or reject the connect request.  The DLS user can also
receive a
DL_@-DIS@-CON@-NECT_@-IND
@prindex DL_DISCONNECT_IND
with a correlation value when the calling DLS user or the DLS provider abort a
connect request.

Once a connection has been accepted or rejected, the correlation value has no
meaning to a DLS user.  The DLS provider may reuse the correlation value in
another
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-IND.
@prindex DL_DISCONNECT_IND
Thus, the lifetime of a correlation value is the duration of the connection
@cpindex Connection establishment
establishment phase, and as good programming practice it should not be used for
any other purpose by the DLS provider.

The DLS provider assigns the correlation value for each connect indication.
Correlation values must be unique among all outstanding connect indications on a
given stream.  The values may, but need not, be unique across all streams to the
DLS provider.  The correlation value must be a positive, non-zero value.  There
is no implied sequencing of connect indications using the correlation value; the
values do not have to increase sequentially for each new connect indication.

@subsection Message DL_CONNECT_REQ (dl_connect_req_t)
@prindex DL_CONNECT_REQ
@tpindex dl_connect_req_t
@cpindex Called DLS user
@cpindex Connection establishment
Requests the DLS provider establish a data link connection with a remote DLS

DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-REQ.
@prindex DL_CONNECT_REQ

@item dl_dest_addr_length
@cpindex Called DLS user
conveys the length of the DLSAP address that identifies the DLS user with whom a
connection is to be established.  If the called user is implemented using DLPI,
this address is the full DLSAP address returned on the
DL_@-BIND_@-ACK.
@prindex DL_BIND_ACK

@item dl_dest_addr_offset
conveys the offset from the beginning of the M_PROTO message block where the
destination DLSAP address begins.

@item dl_qos_length
conveys the length of the quality of service (QOS) parameter values desired by
the DLS user initiating a connection.  The desired QOS values are conveyed in
the appropriate structure defined in @ref{QOS Data Structures}.  A full
specification of these QOS parameters and rules for negotiating their values is
presented in @ref{Quality of Data Link Service}.

If the DLS user does not wish to specify a particular QOS value, the value
DL_@-QOS_@-DONT_@-CARE
@pvindex DL_QOS_DONT_CARE
may be specified.  If the DLS user does not care to specify any QOS parameter
values, this field may be set to zero.

@item dl_qos_offset
conveys the offset from the beginning of the M_PROTO message block where the
quality of service parameters begin.

@item dl_growth
defines a growth field for future enhancements to this primitive.  Its value must
be set to zero.

If the connect request is rejected by the called DLS user, the called DLS user
cannot be reached, or the DLS provider and/or called DLS user do not agree on the
specified quality of service, a
DL_@-DIS@-CON@-NECT_@-IND
@prindex DL_DISCONNECT_IND
is sent to the calling DLS user, resulting in state
DL_@-IDLE.
@stindex DL_IDLE

If the request is erroneous, message

@page
@node Message DL_DATA_REQ
@subsection Message DL_DATA_REQ
@prindex DL_DATA_REQ
Conveys a complete DLSDU from the DLS user to the DLS provider for transmission
over the data link connection.

The DLS provider guarantees to deliver each DLSDU to the remote DLS user in the
same order as received from the local DLS user.  If the DLS provider detects
unrecoverable data loss during data transfer, this may be indicated to the DLS
user by a
DL_@-RE@-SET_@-IND,
@prindex DL_RESET_IND
or by a
DL_@-DIS@-CON@-NECT_@-IND
@prindex DL_DISCONNECT_IND
(if the connection is lost).

@subsubheading Message Format
The message consists of one or more M_DATA message blocks containing at least
one byte of data.

To simplify support of a read(2)/write(2) interface to the data link layer, the
DLS provider must recognize and process messages that consist of one or more
M_DATA message blocks with no preceding M_PROTO message block.  This message type
may originate from the write(2) system call.@footnote{This does not imply that
DLPI will directly support a pure read(2)/write(2).  If such an interface is
desired, a STREAMS module could be implemented to be pushed above the DLS
provider.}

@subsubheading State
The message is valid in state
DL_@-DATAXFER.
@stindex DL_DATAXFER
If it is received in state
DL_@-IDLE
@stindex DL_IDLE
or
DL_@-PROV_@-RE@-SET_@-PEND@-ING,
@stindex DL_RESET_PENDING
it should be discarded without generating an error.

@subsubheading New State
The resulting state is unchanged.

@subsubheading Response
If the request is valid, no response is generated.

If the request is erroneous, a STREAMS M_ERROR message should be issued to the
DLS user specifying an errno value of EPROTO.  This action should be interpreted
as a fatal, unrecoverable, protocol error.  A request is considered erroneous
under the following conditions.

@itemize --
@item The primitive was issued from an invalid state.  If the request is issued
in state
DL_@-IDLE
@stindex DL_IDLE
or
DL_@-PROV_@-RE@-SET_@-PEND@-ING,
@stindex DL_PROV_RESET_PENDING
however, it is silently discarded with
no fatal error generated.
@item The amount of data in the current DLSDU is not within the DLS provider's
acceptable bounds as specified by dl_min_sdu and dl_max_sdu in the
DL_@-INFO_@-ACK.
@prindex DL_INFO_ACK
@end itemize

@subsubheading Note (Support of Direct User-Level Access)
A STREAMS module would implement "more" field processing itself to support
direct user-level access.  This module could collect messages and send them in one
larger message to the DLS provider, or break large DLSDUs passed to the DLS user
into smaller messages.  The module would only be pushed if the DLS user was a
user-level process.

@tpindex dl_unitdata_req_t
Conveys one DLSDU from the DLS user to the DLS provider for transmission to a
peer DLS user.

@cpindex Connectionless mode
Because connectionless data transfer is an unacknowledged service, the DLS
provider makes no guarantees of delivery of connectionless DLSDUs.  It is the

@subsubheading Response
If the DLS provider accepts the data for transmission, there is no response.
This does not, however, guarantee that the data will be delivered to the

is returned, and the resulting state is unchanged.

If for some reason the request cannot be processed, the DLS provider may
generate a

The quality of data link service is defined by the term "Quality of Service"
(QOS), and describes certain characteristics of transmission between two DLS
users.  These characteristics are attributable solely to the DLS provider, but
are observable by the DLS users.  The visibility of QOS characteristics enables a
DLS user to determine, and possibly negotiate, the characteristics of
transmission needed to communicate with the remote DLS user.

Quality of service characteristics apply to both the connection and

@page
@node Connection-mode Service (2)
@subsection Connection-mode Service
@cpindex Connection mode
"Quality of Service" (QOS) refers to certain characteristics of a data link
@cpindex Communication endpoint
connection as observed between the connection endpoints.  QOS describes the
specific aspects of a data link connection that are attributable to the DLS
provider.  QOS is defined in terms of QOS parameters.  The parameters give DLS
users a means of specifying their needs.  These parameters are divided into two
groups, based on how their values are determined:

@itemize @bullet
@item QOS parameters that are negotiated on a per-connection basis during
@cpindex Connection establishment
connection establishment; and
@item QOS parameters that are not negotiated during connection establishment.
@cpindex Connection establishment
The values are determined or known through other methods, usually administrative.
@end itemize

@cpindex Connection establishment
The QOS parameters that can be negotiated during connection establishment are:
throughput, transit delay, priority, and protection.  The QOS parameters for
throughput and transit delay are negotiated end-to-end between the two DLS users
and the DLS provider.  The QOS parameters for priority and protection
are negotiated locally by each DLS user with the DLS provider.  The QOS parameters
that cannot be negotiated are residual error rate and resilience.
@ref{Procedures for QOS Negotiation and Selection}, describes the rules for QOS
negotiation.

@cpindex Connection establishment
Once the connection is established, the agreed QOS values are not renegotiated
at any point.  There is no guarantee by any DLS provider that the original QOS
values will be maintained, and the DLS users are not informed if QOS changes.
The DLS provider also need only record those QOS values selected at connection
establishment for return in response to the
DL_@-INFO_@-REQ
@prindex DL_INFO_REQ
primitive.

@node QOS for Connectionless-mode and Acknowledged Connectionless-mode Service
@subsection QOS for Connectionless-mode and Acknowledged Connectionless-mode Service
@cpindex Connectionless mode
The QOS for connectionless-mode and acknowledged connectionless-mode service
refers to characteristics of the data link layer between two DLSAPs, attributable
to the DLS provider.  The QOS applied to each
DL_@-UNITDATA_@-REQ/DL_@-DATA_@-ACK_@-REQ
@prindex DL_UNITDATA_REQ
@prindex DL_DATA_ACK_REQ
primitive may be independent of the QOS applied to preceding and following
DL_@-UNITDATA_@-REQ/DL_@-DATA_@-ACK_@-REQ
@prindex DL_UNITDATA_REQ
@prindex DL_DATA_ACK_REQ
primitives.  QOS cannot be negotiated between two DLS users as in the
@cpindex Connection mode
connection-mode service.  Every
DL_@-UNITDATA_@-REQ/DL_@-DATA_@-ACK_@-REQ
@prindex DL_UNITDATA_REQ
@prindex DL_DATA_ACK_REQ
primitive may have certain QOS values associated with it.  The supported range
of QOS parameter values is made known to the DLS user in response to the
DL_@-INFO_@-REQ
@prindex DL_INFO_REQ
primitive.  The DLS user may select specific QOS parameter values to be
associated with subsequent data unit transmissions using the
DL_@-UD@-QOS_@-REQ
@prindex DL_UDQOS_REQ
primitive.  This selection is a strictly local management function.  If
different QOS values are to be associated with each transmission,
DL_@-UD@-QOS_@-REQ

@cpindex Connection establishment
This section describes the quality of service parameters supported by DLPI for
@cpindex Connectionless mode
@cpindex Connection mode
both connection-mode and connectionless-mode services.  The following table
summarizes the supported parameters.  It indicates to which service mode
(connection, connectionless, or both) the parameter applies.  For those
@cpindex Connection mode
parameters supported by the connection-mode service, the table also indicates
whether the parameter value is negotiated during connection establishment.  If
so, the table further indicates whether the QOS values are negotiated end-to-end
among both DLS users and the DLS provider, or locally for each DLS user
independently with the DLS provider.

@page
@node Throughput
@subsection Throughput
@cpindex Connection mode
Throughput is a connection-mode QOS parameter that has end-to-end significance.
It is defined as the total number of DLSDU bits successfully transferred by a
DL_@-DATA_@-REQ/DL_@-DATA_@-IND
@prindex DL_DATA_REQ
@prindex DL_DATA_IND
primitive sequence divided by the input/output time, in
seconds, for that sequence.  Successful transfer of a DLSDU is defined to occur
when the DLSDU is delivered to the intended user without error, in proper
sequence, and before connection termination by the receiving DLS user.  The
input/output time for a
DL_@-DATA_@-REQ/DL_@-DATA_@-IND
@prindex DL_DATA_REQ
@prindex DL_DATA_IND
primitive sequence is the greater of:

@itemize @bullet
@item the time between the first and last
DL_@-DATA_@-REQ
@prindex DL_DATA_REQ
in a sequence; and
@item the time between the first and last
DL_@-DATA_@-IND
@prindex DL_DATA_IND
in the sequence.
@end itemize

@cpindex Connection establishment
Throughput is only meaningful for a sequence of complete DLSDUs.  Throughput is
specified and negotiated for the transmit and receive directions independently
at connection establishment.  The throughput specification defines the target and
minimum acceptable values for a connection.  Each specification is an average
rate.  The DLS user can delay the receipt or sending of DLSDUs.  The delay caused
by a DLS user is not included in calculating the average throughput values.

@subsubheading Parameter Format
@example
typedef struct @{
        long dl_target_value;
        long dl_accept_value;
@} dl_through_t;
@tpindex dl_through_t
@end example

This typedef is used to negotiate the transmit and receive throughput values.
@vtable @var
@item dl_target_value
specifies the desired throughput value for the connection in bits/second.

@item dl_accept_value
specifies the minimum acceptable throughput value for the connection in
bits/second.

@end vtable

@page
@node Transit Delay
@subsection Transit Delay
@cpindex Connectionless mode
Connection and connectionless modes can specify a transit delay, which indicates
the elapsed time between a
DL_@-DATA_@-REQ
@prindex DL_DATA_REQ
or
DL_@-UNITDATA_@-REQ
@prindex DL_UNITDATA_REQ
primitive and the corresponding
DL_@-DATA_@-IND
@prindex DL_DATA_IND
or
DL_@-UNITDATA_@-IND
@prindex DL_UNITDATA_IND
primitive.  The elapsed time is only computed for DLSDUs successfully
transferred, as described previously for throughput.

@cpindex Connection establishment
@cpindex Connection mode
In connection mode, transit delay is negotiated on an end-to-end basis during
connection establishment.  For each connection, transit delay is negotiated for
the transmit and receive directions separately by specifying the target value
@cpindex Connectionless mode
and maximum acceptable value.  For connectionless-mode service, a DLS user selects
a particular value within the supported range using the
DL_@-UD@-QOS_@-REQ
@prindex DL_UDQOS_REQ
primitive, and the value may be changed for each DLSDU submitted for
@cpindex Connectionless mode
connectionless transmission.  The transit delay for an individual DLSDU may be
increased if the receiving DLS user flow controls the interface.  The average
and maximum transit delay values exclude any DLS user flow control of the
interface.  The values are specified in milliseconds, and assume a DLSDU size of
128 octets.

@subsubheading Parameter Format
@example
typedef struct @{
        long dl_target_value;
        long dl_accept_value;
@} dl_transdelay_t;
@tpindex dl_transdelay_t
@end example

This typedef is used to negotiate the transmit and receive transit delay values.
@vtable @var
@item dl_target_value
specifies the desired transit delay value.

@item dl_accept_value
specifies the maximum acceptable transit delay value.

@end vtable

@page
@node Priority
@subsection Priority
Priority is negotiated locally between each DLS user and the DLS provider in
@cpindex Connectionless mode
@cpindex Connection mode
connection-mode service, and can also be specified for connectionless-mode
service.  The specification of priority is concerned with the relationship
@cpindex Connectionless mode
between connections or the relationship between connectionless data transfer
requests.  The parameter specifies the relative importance of a connection with
respect to:

@itemize @bullet
@item the order in which connections are to have their QOS degraded, if
necessary; and

@item the order in which connections are to be released to recover resources, if
necessary;

@end itemize

@cpindex Connectionless mode
For connectionless-mode service, the parameter specifies the relative importance
of unitdata objects with respect to gaining use of shared resources.

@cpindex Connection establishment
@cpindex Connection mode
For connection-mode service, each DLS user negotiates a particular priority
value with the DLS provider during connection establishment.  The value is
specified by a minimum and a maximum within a given range.  For
@cpindex Connectionless mode
connectionless-mode service, a DLS user selects a particular priority value
within the supported range using the
DL_@-UD@-QOS_@-REQ
@prindex DL_UDQOS_REQ
primitive, and the value may be changed for each DLSDU submitted for
@cpindex Connectionless mode
connectionless transmission.  This parameter only has meaning in the context of
some management entity or structure able to judge relative importance.  The
priority has local significance only, with a value of zero being the highest
priority and 100 being the lowest priority.

@subsubheading Parameter Format
@example
typedef struct @{
        long dl_min;
        long dl_max;
@} dl_priority_t;
@tpindex dl_priority_t
@end example

@vtable @var
@item dl_min
specifies the minimum acceptable priority.

@item dl_max
specifies the maximum desired priority.

@end vtable

@page
@node Protection
@subsection Protection
Protection is negotiated locally between each DLS user and the DLS provider in
@cpindex Connectionless mode
@cpindex Connection mode
connection-mode service, and can also be specified for connectionless-mode
service.  Protection is the extent to which a DLS provider attempts to prevent
unauthorized monitoring or manipulation of DLS user-originated
information.  Protection is specified by a minimum and maximum protection option
within the following range of possible protection options:

@table @var
@item DL_@-NONE
@pvindex DL_NONE
DLS provider will not protect any DLS user data

@item DL_@-MONITOR
@pvindex DL_MONITOR
DLS provider will protect against passive monitoring

@item DL_@-MAXIMUM
@pvindex DL_MAXIMUM
DLS provider will protect against modification, replay, addition, or deletion of
DLS user data

@end table

@cpindex Connection establishment
@cpindex Connection mode
For connection-mode service, each DLS user negotiates a particular value with
the DLS provider during connection establishment.  The value is specified by a
@cpindex Connectionless mode
minimum and a maximum within a given range.  For connectionless-mode service, a
DLS user selects a particular value within the supported range using
the
DL_@-UD@-QOS_@-REQ
@prindex DL_UDQOS_REQ
primitive, and the value may be changed for each DLSDU submitted for
@cpindex Connectionless mode
connectionless transmission.  Protection has local significance only.

@subsubheading Parameter Format
@example
typedef struct @{
        long dl_min;
        long dl_max;
@} dl_protect_t;
@tpindex dl_protect_t
@end example

@vtable @var
@item dl_min
specifies the minimum acceptable protection.

@item dl_max
specifies the maximum desired protection.

@end vtable

@page
@node Residual Error Rate
@subsection Residual Error Rate
Residual error rate is the ratio of total incorrect, lost and duplicate DLSDUs
to the total DLSDUs transferred between DLS users during a period of time.  The
relationship between these quantities is defined below:

@example
       DLSDUl + DLSDUi + DLSDUe
RER = ---------------------------
             DLSDUtot
@end example

where

@table @var
@item DLSDUtot
= total DLSDUs transferred, which is the total of DLSDUl,  DLSDUi, DLSDUe, and
correctly received DLSDUs.

@item DLSDUe
= DLSDUs received 2 or more times.

@item DLSDUi
= incorrectly received DLSDUs.

@item DLSDUl
= DLSDUs sent, but not received.

@end table

@subsubheading Parameter Format

@example
long dl_residual_error;
@end example

The residual error value is scaled by a factor of 1,000,000, since the parameter
is stored as a long integer in the QOS data structures.  Residual error rate is
not a negotiated QOS parameter.  Its value is determined by procedures outside
the definition of DLPI.  It is assumed to be set by an administrative mechanism,
which is informed of the value by network management.

@page
@node Resilience
@subsection Resilience
@cpindex Connection mode
Resilience is meaningful in connection mode only, and represents the probability
of either: DLS provider-initiated disconnects or DLS provider-initiated resets
during a time interval of 10,000 seconds on a connection.  Resilience is not a
negotiated QOS parameter.  Its value is determined by procedures outside the
definition of DLPI.  It is assumed to be set by an administrative mechanism, which
is informed of the value by network management.

@subsubheading Parameter Format
@example
typedef struct @{
        long dl_disc_prob;
        long dl_reset_prob;
@} dl_resilience_t;
@tpindex dl_resilience_t
@end example

@vtable @var
@item dl_disc_prob
specifies the probability of receiving a provider-initiated disconnect, scaled
by 10000.

@item dl_reset_prob
specifies the probability of receiving a provider-initiated reset, scaled by
10000.

To simplify the definition of the primitives containing QOS parameters and the
discussion of QOS negotiation, the QOS parameters are organized into four
structures.  This section defines the structures and indicates which structures
apply to which primitives.  Each structure is tagged with a type field contained
in the first four bytes of the structure, similar to the tagging of primitives.
The type field has been defined because of the current volatility of QOS
parameter definition within the international standards bodies.  If new QOS
parameter sets are defined in the future for the data link layer, the type field
will enable DLPI to accommodate these sets without breaking existing DLS user or
provider implementations.  However, DLS user and provider software should be
cognizant of the possibility that new QOS structure types may be defined in
future issues of the DLPI specification.  If a DLS provider receives a structure
type that it does not understand in a given primitive, the error
DL_@-BADQOSTYPE
@peindex DL_BADQOSTYPE
should be returned to the DLS user in a
DL_@-ERROR_@-ACK
@prindex DL_ERROR_ACK
primitive.

Currently the following QOS structure types are defined:

@table @var
@item DL_@-QOS_@-CO_@-RANGE@-1
@pvindex DL_QOS_CO_RANGE1
@cpindex Connection mode
QOS range structure for connection-mode service for Issue 1 of DLPI

@item DL_@-QOS_@-CO_@-SEL@-1
@pvindex DL_QOS_CO_SEL1
@cpindex Connection mode
QOS selection structure for connection-mode service for Issue 1 of DLPI

@cpindex Connection establishment
This section describes the methods used for negotiating and/or selecting QOS
@cpindex Connection mode
parameter values.  In the connection-mode service, some QOS parameter values may
@cpindex Connectionless mode
be negotiated during connection establishment.  For connectionless-mode service,
parameter values may be selected for subsequent data transmission.

Throughout this section, two special QOS values are referenced.  These are
defined for all the parameters used in QOS negotiation and selection.  The
values are:

@table @var
@item DL_@-UNKNOWN
@pvindex DL_UNKNOWN
This value indicates that the DLS provider does not know the value for the field
or does not support that parameter.

@item DL_@-QOS_@-DONT_@-CARE
@pvindex DL_QOS_DONT_CARE
This value indicates that the DLS user does not care to what value the QOS
parameter is set.

@end table

These values are used to distinguish between DLS providers that support and
negotiate QOS parameters and those that cannot.  The following sections include
the interpretation of these values during QOS negotiation and selection.

@page
@node Connection-mode QOS Negotiation
@subsection Connection-mode QOS Negotiation
@cpindex Connection mode
The current connection-mode QOS parameters can be divided into three types as
follows:

@itemize @bullet
@item Those that are negotiated end-to-end between peer DLS users and the DLS
@cpindex Connection establishment
provider during connection establishment (throughput and transit delay);

@item those that are negotiated locally between each DLS user and the DLS
@cpindex Connection establishment
provider during connection establishment (priority and protection); and

@item those that cannot be negotiated (residual error rate and resilience).
@end itemize

The rules for processing these three types of parameters during connection
@cpindex Connection establishment
establishment are described in this section.

The current definition of most existing data link protocols does not describe a
@cpindex Connection establishment
mechanism for negotiating QOS parameters during connection establishment.  As
such, DLPI does not require every DLS provider implementation to support QOS
negotiation.  If a given DLS provider implementation cannot support
QOS negotiation, two alternatives are available:

@itemize
@item The DLS provider may specify that any or all QOS parameters are unknown.
This is indicated to the DLS user in the
DL_@-INFO_@-ACK,
@prindex DL_INFO_ACK
where the values in the QOS range field (indicated by dl_qos_range_length and
dl_qos_range_offset) and the current QOS field (indicated by dl_qos_length and
dl_qos_offset) of this primitive are set to
DL_@-UNKNOWN.
@pvindex DL_UNKNOWN
This value will also be indicated on the
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-IND
@prindex DL_CONNECT_IND
and
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-CON
@prindex DL_CONNECT_CON
primitives.  If the DLS provider does not support any QOS parameters, the QOS
length field may be set to zero in each of these of these primitives.

@item The DLS provider may interpret QOS parameters with strictly local
significance, and their values in the
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-IND
@prindex DL_CONNECT_IND
primitive will be set to
DL_@-UNKNOWN.
@pvindex DL_UNKNOWN
@end itemize

A DLS user need not select a specific value for each QOS parameter.  The special
QOS parameter value,
DL_@-QOS_@-DONT_@-CARE,
@pvindex DL_QOS_DONT_CARE
is used if the DLS user does not care what quality of service is provided for a
particular parameter.  The negotiation procedures presented below explain the
exact semantics of this value during
@cpindex Connection establishment
connection establishment.

If QOS parameters are supported by the DLS provider, the provider will define a
set of default QOS parameter values that are used whenever
DL_@-QOS_@-DONT_@-CARE
@pvindex DL_QOS_DONT_CARE
is specified for a QOS parameter value.  These default values can be defined for
all DLS users or can be defined on a per DLS user basis.  The default parameter
value set is returned in the QOS field (indicated by dl_qos_length and
dl_qos_offset) of the
DL_@-INFO_@-ACK
@prindex DL_INFO_ACK
before a DLS user negotiates QOS parameter values.

DLS provider addendum documentation must describe the known ranges of support
for the QOS parameters and the default values, and also specify whether they are
used in a local manner only.  The following procedures are used to negotiate QOS
@cpindex Connection establishment
parameter values during connection establishment.

@table @asis
@item (1)
@cpindex Calling DLS user
The
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-REQ
@prindex DL_CONNECT_REQ
specifies the DLS user's desired range of QOS values in the dl_qos_co_range1_t
structure.  The target and least-acceptable values are specified for throughput
and transit delay, as described in @ref{Throughput}, and @ref{Transit Delay}.
The target value is the value desired by the calling DLS user for the QOS
parameters.  The least acceptable value is the lowest value the calling user
will accept.  These values are specified separately for both the transmit and
receive directions of the connection.

If either value is set to
DL_@-QOS_@-DONT_@-CARE
@pvindex DL_QOS_DONT_CARE
the DLS provider will supply a default value, subject to the following
consistency constraints:

@itemize --
@item If
DL_@-QOS_@-DONT_@-CARE
@pvindex DL_QOS_DONT_CARE
is specified for the target value, the value chosen by the DLS provider may not
be less than the least-acceptable value.

@item If
DL_@-QOS_@-DONT_@-CARE
@pvindex DL_QOS_DONT_CARE
is specified for the least-acceptable value, the value set by the DLS provider
cannot be greater than the target value.

@item If
DL_@-QOS_@-DONT_@-CARE
@pvindex DL_QOS_DONT_CARE
is specified for both the target and least-acceptable value, the DLS provider is
free to select any value, without constraint, for the target and least
acceptable values.
@end itemize

For priority and protection, the
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-REQ
@prindex DL_CONNECT_REQ
specifies a minimum and maximum desired value as defined in @ref{Priority}, and
@ref{Protection}.  As with throughput and transit delay, the DLS user may
specify a value of
DL_@-QOS_@-DONT_@-CARE
@pvindex DL_QOS_DONT_CARE
for either the minimum or maximum value.  The DLS provider will interpret this
value subject to the following consistency constraints:

@itemize --
@item If
DL_@-QOS_@-DONT_@-CARE
@pvindex DL_QOS_DONT_CARE
is specified for the maximum value, the value chosen by the DLS provider may not
be less than the minimum value.

@item If
DL_@-QOS_@-DONT_@-CARE
@pvindex DL_QOS_DONT_CARE
is specified for the minimum value, the value set by the DLS provider cannot be
greater than the maximum value.

@item If
DL_@-QOS_@-DONT_@-CARE
@pvindex DL_QOS_DONT_CARE
is specified for both the minimum and maximum values, the DLS provider is free
to select any value, without constraint, for the maximum and minimum values.
@end itemize

The values of the residual error rate and resilience parameters in the
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-REQ
@prindex DL_CONNECT_REQ
have no meaning and are ignored by the DLS provider.

If the value of dl_qos_length in the
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-REQ
@prindex DL_CONNECT_REQ
is set to zero by the DLS user, the DLS provider should treat all QOS parameter
values as if they were set to
DL_@-QOS_@-DONT_@-CARE,
@pvindex DL_QOS_DONT_CARE
selecting any value in its supported range.

@cpindex Calling DLS user
If the DLS provider cannot support throughput, transit delay, priority, and
protection values within the ranges specified in the
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-REQ,
@prindex DL_CONNECT_REQ
a
DL_@-DIS@-CON@-NECT_@-IND
@prindex DL_DISCONNECT_IND
should be sent to the calling DLS user.

@item (2)
@cpindex Called DLS user
If the requested ranges of values for throughput and transit delay in the
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-REQ
@prindex DL_CONNECT_REQ
are acceptable to the DLS provider, the QOS parameters will be adjusted to
values the DLS provider will support.  Only the target value may be adjusted,
and it is set to a value the DLS provider is willing to provide (which may be of
lower QOS than the target value).  The least-acceptable value cannot be
modified.  The updated QOS range is then sent to the called DLS user in the
dl_qos_co_range1_t structure of the
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-IND,
@prindex DL_CONNECT_IND
where it is interpreted as the available range of service.

@cpindex Calling DLS user
If the requested range of values for priority and protection in the
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-REQ
@prindex DL_CONNECT_REQ
is acceptable to the DLS provider, an appropriate value within the range is
selected and saved for each parameter; these selected values will be returned to
the DLS user in the corresponding
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-CON
@prindex DL_CONNECT_CON
primitive.  Because priority and protection are negotiated locally, the
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-IND
@prindex DL_CONNECT_IND
will not contain values selected during negotiation with the calling DLS user.
Instead, the DLS provider will offer a range of values in the
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-IND
@prindex DL_CONNECT_IND
that will be supported locally for the called DLS user.

The DLS provider will also include the supported values for residual error rate
and resilience in the
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-IND
@prindex DL_CONNECT_IND
that is passed to the called DLS user.

If the DLS provider does not support negotiation of throughput, transit delay,
priority, or protection, a value of
DL_@-UNKNOWN
@pvindex DL_UNKNOWN
should be set in the least-acceptable, target, minimum, and maximum value fields
of the
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-IND.
@prindex DL_CONNECT_IND
Also, if the DLS provider does not support any particular QOS
parameter,
DL_@-UNKNOWN
@pvindex DL_UNKNOWN
should be specified in all value fields for that parameter.  If the DLS provider
does not support any QOS parameters, the value of dl_qos_length may be set to
zero in the
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-IND.
@prindex DL_CONNECT_IND

@item (3)
@cpindex Called DLS user
Upon receiving the
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-IND,
@prindex DL_CONNECT_IND
the called DLS user examines the QOS parameter values and selects a specific
value from the proffered range of the throughput, transit delay, priority, and
protection parameters.  If the called DLS user does not agree on values in the
given range, the connection should be refused with a
DL_@-DIS@-CON@-NECT_@-REQ
@prindex DL_DISCONNECT_REQ
primitive.  Otherwise, the selected values are returned to the DLS provider in
the dl_qos_co_sel1_t structure of the
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-RES
@prindex DL_CONNECT_RES
primitive.

The values of residual error rate and resilience in the
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-RES
@prindex DL_CONNECT_RES
are ignored by the DLS provider.  These parameters may not be negotiated by the
called DLS user.  The selected values of throughput and transit delay are
meaningful, however, and are adopted for the connection by the DLS provider.
Similarly, the selected priority and protection values are adopted with local
significance for the called DLS user.

If the user specifies
DL_@-QOS_@-DONT_@-CARE
@pvindex DL_QOS_DONT_CARE
for either throughput, transit delay, priority, or protection on the
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-RES,
@prindex DL_CONNECT_RES
the DLS provider will select a value from the range specified for that parameter
in the
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-IND
@prindex DL_CONNECT_IND
primitive.  Also, a value of zero in the dl_qos_length field of the
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-RES
@prindex DL_CONNECT_RES
is equivalent to
DL_@-QOS_@-DONT_@-CARE
@pvindex DL_QOS_DONT_CARE
for all QOS parameters.

@item (4)
@cpindex Called DLS user
@cpindex Calling DLS user
@cpindex Connection establishment
Upon completion of connection establishment, the values of throughput and
transit delay as selected by the called DLS user are returned to the calling DLS
user in the dl_qos_co_sel1_t structure of the
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-CON
@prindex DL_CONNECT_CON
primitive.  The values of priority and protection that were selected by the DLS
provider from the range indicated in the
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-REQ
@prindex DL_CONNECT_REQ
will also be returned in the
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-CON.
@prindex DL_CONNECT_CON
This primitive will also contain the values of residual error rate and
resilience associated with the newly established connection.  The DLS provider
also saves the negotiated QOS parameter values for the connection, so that they
may be returned in response to a
DL_@-INFO_@-REQ
@prindex DL_INFO_REQ
primitive.

As with
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-IND,
@prindex DL_CONNECT_IND
if the DLS provider does not support negotiation of throughput, transit delay,
priority, or protection, a value of
DL_@-UNKNOWN
@pvindex DL_UNKNOWN
should be returned in the selected value fields.  Furthermore, if the DLS
provider does not support any particular QOS parameter,
DL_@-UNKNOWN
@pvindex DL_UNKNOWN
should be specified in all value fields for that parameter, or the value of
dl_qos_length may be set to zero in the
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-CON
@prindex DL_CONNECT_CON
primitive.

@end table

@page
@node Connectionless-mode QOS Selection
@subsection Connectionless-mode QOS Selection
@cpindex Connectionless mode
This section describes the procedures for selecting QOS parameter values that
will be associated with the transmission of connectionless data or acknowledged
connectionless data.

@cpindex Connection mode
As with connection-mode protocols, the current definition of most existing
(acknowledged) connectionless data link protocols does not define a quality of
service concept.  As such, DLPI does not require every DLS provider
implementation to support QOS parameter selection.  The DLS provider may specify
that any or all QOS parameters are unsupported.  This is indicated to the DLS user
in the
DL_@-INFO_@-ACK,
@prindex DL_INFO_ACK
where the values in the supported range field (indicated by dl_qos_range_length
and dl_qos_range_offset)and the current QOS field (indicated by dl_qos_length
and dl_qos_offset) of this primitive are set to
DL_@-UNKNOWN.
@pvindex DL_UNKNOWN

If the DLS provider supports no QOS parameters, the QOS length fields in the
DL_@-INFO_@-ACK
@prindex DL_INFO_ACK
may be set to zero.  If the DLS provider supports QOS parameter selection, the
DL_@-INFO_@-ACK
@prindex DL_INFO_ACK
primitive will specify the supported range of parameter values for transit
delay, priority, protection and residual error rate.  Default values are also
returned in the
DL_@-INFO_@-ACK.
@prindex DL_INFO_ACK

For each
DL_@-UNITDATA_@-REQ/DL_@-DATA_@-ACK_@-REQ,
@prindex DL_UNITDATA_REQ
@prindex DL_DATA_ACK_REQ
the DLS provider should apply the currently selected QOS parameter values to the
transmission.  If no values have been selected, the default values should be
used.

At any point during data transfer, the DLS user may issue a
DL_@-UD@-QOS_@-REQ
@prindex DL_UDQOS_REQ
primitive to select new values for the transit delay, priority, and protection
parameters.  These values are selected using the dl_qos_cl_sel1_t structure.
The residual error rate parameter is ignored by this primitive and cannot be
set by a DLS user.

In the
DL_@-UD@-QOS_@-REQ,
@prindex DL_UDQOS_REQ
the DLS user need not require a specific value for every QOS parameter.
DL_@-QOS_@-DONT_@-CARE
@pvindex DL_QOS_DONT_CARE
may be specified if the DLS user does not care what quality of service is
provided for a particular parameter.  When specified, the DLS provider should
retain the current (or default if no previous selection has occurred) value for
that parameter.

This appendix presents the allowable sequence of DLPI primitives.  The sequence
is described using a state transition table that defines possible states as
viewed by the DLS user.  The state transition table describes transitions based
on the current state of the interface and a given DLPI event.  Each
transition consists of a state change and possibly an interface action.  The
states, events, and related transition actions are described below, followed by
the state transition table itself.

@appendixsec Variables and Actions for State Transition Table
The following tables describe variables and actions used to describe the DLPI
state transitions.  The variables are used to distinguish various uses of the
same DLPI primitive.  For example, a
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-RES
@prindex DL_CONNECT_RES
causes a different state transition depending on the current number of
outstanding connect indications.  To distinguish these different connect
response events, a variable is used to track the number of outstanding connect
indications.

@tabfig{dlpi_tab8,3,DPLI State Transition Table Variables}

The actions represent steps the DLS provider must take during certain state
transitions to maintain the interface state.  When an action is indicated in the
state transition table, the DLS provider should change the state as indicated
and perform the specified action.

@tabref{7}, @tabref{8}, @tabref{9} and @tabref{10} describe the DLPI state
transitions.  Each column represents a state of DLPI (@tabref{2a}) and each row
represents a DLPI event (@tabref{5} and @tabref{6}).  The intersecting transition
cell defines the resulting state transition (i.e.  next state) and associated
actions, if any, that must be executed by the DLS provider to maintain the
interface state.  Each cell may contain the following:

@image{dlpi_ta12}

The
DL_@-INFO_@-REQ,
@prindex DL_INFO_REQ
DL_@-INFO_@-ACK,
@prindex DL_INFO_ACK
DL_@-TOK@-EN_@-REQ, and
@prindex DL_TOKEN_REQ
DL_@-TOK@-EN_@-ACK primitives
@prindex DL_TOKEN_ACK
are excluded from the state transition table because they can be issued from many
states and, when fully processed, do not cause a state transition to occur.
However, the DLS user may not issue a
DL_@-INFO_@-REQ or
@prindex DL_INFO_REQ
DL_@-TOK@-EN_@-REQ if any local
@prindex DL_TOKEN_REQ
acknowledgments are pending.  In other words, these two primitives may not be
issued until the DLS user receives the acknowledgment for any previously issued
primitive that is expecting local positive acknowledgment.  Thus, these
primitives may not be issued from the
DL_@-ATTACH_@-PEND@-ING,

DL_@-DIS@-CON@-12_@-PEND@-ING, or
@stindex DL_DISCON12_PENDING
DL_@-DIS@-CON@-13_@-PEND@-ING states.  Failure to
@stindex DL_DISCON13_PENDING
comply by this restriction may result in loss of primitives at the stream head
if the DLS user is a user process.  Once a
DL_@-INFO_@-REQ or
@prindex DL_INFO_REQ
DL_@-TOK@-EN_@-REQ
@prindex DL_TOKEN_REQ
has been issued, the DLS provider must respond with the appropriate
acknowledgment primitive.

The following rules apply to the maintenance of DLPI state:

@itemize @bullet
@item The DLS provider is responsible for keeping a record of the state of the
interface as viewed by the DLS user, to be returned in the
DL_@-INFO_@-ACK.
@prindex DL_INFO_ACK

@item The DLS provider may never generate a primitive that places the interface
out of state (i.e.  would correspond to a "-" cell entry in the state transition
table below).

@item If the DLS provider generates a STREAMS M_ERROR message upstream, it
should free any further primitives processed by it's write side put or service
procedure.

@item The close of a stream is considered an abortive action by the DLS user,
and may be executed from any state.  The DLS provider must issue appropriate
indications to the remote DLS user when a close occurs.  For example, if the DLPI
state is
DL_@-DATAXFER,
@stindex DL_DATAXFER
a
DL_@-DIS@-CON@-NECT_@-IND
@prindex DL_DISCONNECT_IND
should be sent to the remote DLS user.
The DLS provider should free any resources associated with that stream and reset
the stream to its unopened condition.  The following points clarify the state
transition table.

@item If the DLS provider supports connection-mode service, the value of the
@cpindex Connection mode
outcnt state variable must be initialized to zero for each stream when that
stream is first opened.

@item The initial and final state for a style 2 DLS provider is
DL_@-UNATTACHED.
@stindex DL_UNATTACHED
However, because a style 1 DLS provider implicitly attaches a PPA to a stream
when it is opened, the initial and final DLPI state for a style 1 provider is
DL_@-UNBOUND.
@stindex DL_UNBOUND
The DLS user should not issue
DL_@-ATTACH_@-REQ
@prindex DL_ATTACH_REQ
or DL_@-DETACH_@-REQ
@prindex DL_DETACH_REQ
primitives to a style 1 DLS provider.

@item A DLS provider may have multiple connect indications outstanding (i.e.  the
DLS user has not responded to them) at one time (@pxref{Multi-threaded Connection
Establishment}).  As the state transition table points out, the stream on which

@item The DLPI state associated with a given stream may be transferred to
another stream only when the

@prindex DL_CONNECT_RES
primitive indicates this behavior.  In this case, the responding stream (where
the connection will be established) must be in the

@item The DLS provider must be ready to receive M_FLUSH messages from upstream
and flush it's queues as specified in the message.

@end menu

This appendix presents the precedence of DLPI primitives relative to one
another.  Two queues are used to describe DLPI precedence rules.  One queue
contains DLS user-originated primitives and corresponds to the STREAMS write
queue of the DLS provider.  The other queue contains DLS
provider-originated primitives and corresponds to the STREAMS read queue of the
DLS user.  The DLS provider is responsible for determining precedence on its write
queue and the DLS user is responsible for determining precedence on its read
queue as indicated in the precedence tables below.  For each precedence table,
the rows (labeled PRIM X) correspond to primitives that are on the given queue
and the columns (labeled PRIM Y) correspond to primitives that are about to be
placed on that queue.  Each pair of primitives (PRIM X, PRIM Y) may be
manipulated resulting in:

@itemize @bullet
@item Change of order, where the order of a pair of primitives is reversed if,
and only if, the second primitive in the pair (PRIM Y) is of a type defined to be
able to advance ahead of the first primitive in the pair (PRIM X).

@item Deletion, where a primitive (PRIM X) may be deleted if, and only if, the
primitive that follows it(PRIM Y) is defined to be destructive with respect to
that primitive.  Destructive primitives may always be added to the queue.  Some
primitives may cause both primitives in the pair to be destroyed.  The precedence
rules define the allowed manipulations of a pair of DLPI primitives.  Whether
these actions are performed is the choice of the DLS provider for user-originated
primitives and the choice of the DLS user for provider-originated primitives.
@end itemize

@page
@node Write Queue Precedence
@appendixsec Write Queue Precedence
The following table presents the precedence rules for DLS user-originated
primitives on the DLS provider's STREAMS write queue.  It assumes that only
non-local primitives (i.e.  those that generate protocol data units to a peer DLS
user) are queued by the DLS provider.

@cpindex Connection establishment
For connection establishment primitives, this table represents the possible
pairs of DLPI primitives when connect indications/responses are single-threaded.
For the multi-threading scenario, the following rules apply:

@itemize @bullet
@item A
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-RES
@prindex DL_CONNECT_RES
primitive has no precedence over either a
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-RES
@prindex DL_CONNECT_RES
or a
DL_@-DIS@-CON@-NECT_@-REQ primitive that is associated with another connection
@prindex DL_DISCONNECT_REQ
correlation number (dl_correlation), and should therefore be placed on the queue
behind such primitives.

@item Similarly, a
DL_@-DIS@-CON@-NECT_@-REQ
@prindex DL_DISCONNECT_REQ
primitive has no precedence over either a
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-RES
@prindex DL_CONNECT_RES
or a
DL_@-DIS@-CON@-NECT_@-REQ
@prindex DL_DISCONNECT_REQ
primitive that is associated with another connection correlation number, and
should therefore be placed on the queue behind such primitives.  Notice,
however, that a
DL_@-DIS@-CON@-NECT_@-REQ
@prindex DL_DISCONNECT_REQ
does have precedence over a
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-RES
@prindex DL_CONNECT_RES
primitive that is associated with the same correlation number (this is indicated
in the table below).

@node Read Queue Precedence
@appendixsec Read Queue Precedence
The following table presents the precedence rules for DLS provider-originated
primitives on the DLS user's STREAMS read queue.

@cpindex Connection establishment
For connection establishment primitives, this table represents the possible
pairs of DLPI primitives when connect indications/responses are single-threaded.
For the multi-threading scenario, the following rules apply:

@enumerate
@item A
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-IND
@prindex DL_CONNECT_IND
primitive has no precedence over either a
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-IND or a
@prindex DL_CONNECT_IND
DL_@-DIS@-CON@-NECT_@-IND
@prindex DL_DISCONNECT_IND
primitive that is associated with another connection correlation number
(dl_correlation), and should therefore be placed on the queue behind such
primitives.

@item Similarly, a
DL_@-DIS@-CON@-NECT_@-IND
@prindex DL_DISCONNECT_IND
primitive has no precedence over either
a
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-IND
@prindex DL_CONNECT_IND
or a
DL_@-DIS@-CON@-NECT_@-IND
@prindex DL_DISCONNECT_IND
primitive that is associated with another connection correlation number, and
should therefore be placed on the queue behind such primitives.

@item A
DL_@-DIS@-CON@-NECT_@-IND
@prindex DL_DISCONNECT_IND
does have precedence over a
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-IND
@prindex DL_CONNECT_IND
primitive that is associated with the same correlation number (this is indicated
in the table below).  If a
DL_@-DIS@-CON@-NECT_@-IND
@prindex DL_DISCONNECT_IND
is about to be placed on the DLS user's read queue, the user should scan the
read queue for a possible
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-IND
@prindex DL_CONNECT_IND
primitive with a matching correlation number.  If a match is found, both the
DL_@-DIS@-CON@-NECT_@-IND
@prindex DL_DISCONNECT_IND
and matching
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-IND
@prindex DL_CONNECT_IND
should be removed.
@end enumerate

If the DLS user is a user-level process, it's read queue is the stream head read
queue.  Because a user process has no control over the placement of DLS primitives
on the stream head read queue, a DLS user cannot straightforwardly initiate the
actions specified in the following precedence table.  Except for the connection
@cpindex Connection establishment
establishment scenario, the DLS user can ignore the precedence rules defined in
the table below.  This is equivalent to saying the DLS user's read queue contains
at most one primitive.  The only exception to this rule is the processing of
connect indication/response primitives.  A problem arises if a user issues a
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-RES
@prindex DL_CONNECT_RES
primitive when a
DL_@-DIS@-CON@-NECT_@-IND
@prindex DL_DISCONNECT_IND
is on the stream head read queue.  The DLS provider will not be expecting the
connect response because it has forwarded the disconnect indication to the DLS
user and is in the
DL_@-IDLE
@stindex DL_IDLE
state.  It will therefore generate an error upon seeing the
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-RES.
@prindex DL_CONNECT_RES
To avoid this error, the DLS user should not respond to a
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-IND
@prindex DL_CONNECT_IND
primitive if the stream head read queue is not empty.  The assumption here is a
nonempty queue may be holding a disconnect indication that is associated with
the connect indication that is being processed.

When connect indications/responses are single-threaded, a non-empty read queue
can only contain a
DL_@-DIS@-CON@-NECT_@-IND,
@prindex DL_DISCONNECT_IND
which must be associated with the outstanding
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-IND.
@prindex DL_CONNECT_IND
This
DL_@-DIS@-CON@-NECT_@-IND
@prindex DL_DISCONNECT_IND
primitive indicates to the DLS user that the
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-IND
@prindex DL_CONNECT_IND
is to be removed.  The DLS user should not issue a response to the
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-IND
@prindex DL_CONNECT_IND
if a
DL_@-DIS@-CON@-NECT_@-IND
@prindex DL_DISCONNECT_IND
is received.  The multi-threaded scenario is slightly more complex, because
multiple
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-IND
@prindex DL_CONNECT_IND
and
DL_@-DIS@-CON@-NECT_@-IND
@prindex DL_DISCONNECT_IND
primitives may be interspersed on the stream head read queue.  In this scenario,
the DLS user should retrieve all indications on the queue before responding to a
given connect indication.  If a queued primitive is a
DL_@-CON@-NECT_@-IND,
@prindex DL_CONNECT_IND
it should be stored by the user process for eventual response.  If a queued
primitive is a
DL_@-DIS@-CON@-NECT_@-IND,
@prindex DL_DISCONNECT_IND
it should be matched (using the correlation number) against any stored connect
indications.  The matched connect indication should then be removed, just as is
done in the single-threaded scenario.

@node Guidelines for Protocol Independent DLS Users
@appendix Guidelines for Protocol Independent DLS Users
DLPI enables a DLS user to be implemented in a protocol-independent manner such
that the DLS user can operate over many DLS providers without changing the DLS
user software.  DLS user implementors must adhere to the following guidelines,
however, to achieve this independence.

@itemize @bullet
@item The protocol-specific service limits returned in the
DL_@-INFO_@-ACK
@prindex DL_INFO_ACK
primitive (e.g.  dl_max_sdu) mustn't be exceeded.  The DLS user should access
these limits and adhere to them while interacting with the DLS provider.

@item Protocol-specific DLSAP address and PPA identifier formats should be
hidden from DLS user software.  Hard-coded addresses and identifiers must be
avoided.  The DLS user should retrieve the necessary information from some other
entity (such as a management entity or a higher layer protocol entity) and insert
it without inspection into the appropriate primitives.

@item The DLS user should not be written to a specific style of DLS provider
(i.e.  style 1 vs.  style 2).  The
DL_@-INFO_@-ACK
@prindex DL_INFO_ACK
returns sufficient information to identify which style of provider has been
accessed, and the DLS user should perform (or not perform) a
DL_@-ATTACH_@-REQ
@prindex DL_ATTACH_REQ
accordingly.

@item The names of devices should not be hard-coded into user-level programs
that access a DLS provider.

@item The DLS user should access the dl_service_mode field of the
DL_@-INFO_@-ACK
@prindex DL_INFO_ACK
primitive to determine whether connection or connectionless services are
available on a given stream.

@node Required Information for DLS Provider-Specific Addenda
@appendix Required Information for DLS Provider-Specific Addenda
DLPI is a general interface to the services of any DLS provider.  However, areas
have been documented in this specification where DLS provider-specific
information can be conveyed and interpreted.  This appendix summarizes all
provider-specific issues as an aid to developers of DLS provider implementations.
As such, it forms a checklist of required information that should be documented
in some manner as part of the provider implementation.  The areas DLS
provider-specific addendum documentation must address are:

@itemize @bullet
@item DLSAP Address Space

@item PPA Access and Control

@item Quality of Service

@item DL_@-INFO_@-ACK Values
@prindex DL_INFO_ACK

@item Supported Services
@end itemize

For each area listed, a brief description of the provider-specific item(s)
associated with it will be presented, including references to the appropriate
section in this specification.

DLSAP Address Space (Sections 2.3.2 and 4.1.6)
The format of a DLSAP address is specific to each DLS provider, as is the
management of that address space.  There are no restriction on the format or
style of a DLSAP address.  As such, a specific implementation should document
the format, size, and restrictions of a DLSAP address, as well as information on
how the address space is managed.  For example, DLPI enables a DLS user to
choose a specific DLSAP address to be bound to a stream, but a given
implementation may pre-associate addresses with streams based, for example, on
the major/minor device number of the stream.  In this case, the DLS user could
only retrieve the address associated with a stream.  If the DLS provider enables
a user to select the DLSAP address for a stream, the implementation must
document the contents of the dl_sap field in the
DL_@-BIND_@-REQ.
@prindex DL_BIND_REQ
This field must contain sufficient information to enable the DLS provider to
determine the chosen DLSAP address.  This may be the full DLSAP address (if it
is not larger than sizeof(ulong)), or some distinguishable part of that address.
For example, an implementation of a DLS provider conforming to the ISO 8802/2
address space might allow the DSAP or SSAP portion of the DLSAP address to be
specified here, where the MAC address portion remains constant over all DLSAP
addresses managed by that provider.

Another aspect of address management is whether the provider supports the
ability to dynamically allocate DLSAPs other than the requested DLSAP in a
DL_@-BIND_@-REQ.
@prindex DL_BIND_REQ
Restrictions on DLSAPs might cover the range of supported DLSAP values, services
@cpindex Connection management stream
provided by a DLSAP, connection management, and multiplexing.  An example of
connection management restrictions is the number of connections allowed per
DLSAP.  Examples of multiplexing restrictions include the number of DLSAPs per
PPA, and requirements that certain DLSAPs are attached to specific PPAs.

Subsequent DLSAP Addresses (Section 4.1.9)
The IEEE 802.2 link layer standard allows two ways of specifying a DLSAP value:

@itemize @bullet
@item Using an IEEE reserved DLSAP which corresponds to a well-defined protocol.

@item Using a privately defined DLSAP.  Previously, subnetworks used privately
defined DLSAP values.  As these subnetworks move into the OSI world, they may
exist in environments with other vendors machines.  This presents a problem
because there are only 64 privately definable DLSAPS and any other vendor may
choose to use these same DLSAP values.
@end itemize

IEEE 802.1 has defined a third way of assigning DLSAP values that will allow for
unique private protocol de-multiplexing.  The
DL_@-SUBS_BIND_@-REQ
@prindex DL_SUBS_BIND_REQ
may be used to support this method.  The Subsequent binding of DLSAPs can be
peer or hierarchical.  When the User requests peer addressing, the
DL_@-SUBS_BIND_@-REQ
@prindex DL_SUBS_BIND_REQ
will specify a DLSAP that may be used in lieu of the DLSAP that was bound in the
DL_@-BIND_@-REQ.
@prindex DL_BIND_REQ
This will allow for a choice to be made between a number of DLSAPs on a stream
when determining traffic based on DLSAP values.  An example of this would be to
various ether_type values as DLSAPs.  The
DL_@-BIND_@-REQ,
@prindex DL_BIND_REQ
for example, could be issued with ether_type value of IP, and a subsequent bind
could be issued with ether type value of ARP.  The Provider may now multiplex
off of the ether_type field and allow for either IP or ARP traffic to be sent up
this stream.  When the DLS User requests hierarchical binding, the
DL_@-SUBS_BIND_@-REQ
@prindex DL_SUBS_BIND_REQ
will specify a DLSAP that will be used in addition to the DLSAP bound using a
DL_@-BIND_@-REQ.
@prindex DL_BIND_REQ
This will allow additional information to be specified, that will be used in a
header or used for de-multiplexing.  An example of this would be to use
hierarchical bind to specify the OUI (organizationally unique identifier) to be
used by SNAP.  If a DLS Provider supports peer subsequent bind operations, the
first SAP that is bound is used as the source SAP when there is ambiguity.

PPA Access and Control (Sections 2.3.1 and 4.1.1)
A physical point of attachment (PPA) is referenced in DLPI by a PPA identifier,
which is of type 'ulong'.  The format of this identifier is provider-specific.
The DLS provider addendum documentation should describe the format and
generation of PPA identifiers for all physical media it is expected to control.
It should also describe how a PPA is controlled, the capabilities of the PPA,
the number of PPAs supported, and the administrative interface.  Multiplexing
capabilities of a PPA should also be described in the DLS provider addendum
documentation.  This conveys information on the number of DLSAPs that may be
supported per PPA, and the number of PPAs supported.  Another item that should
be described is the manner in which a PPA is initialized.  Section 4.1.1, PPA
Initialization/De-initialization, presents the alternative methods supported by
DLPI for initializing a PPA.  The interactions of auto-initialization or
pre-initialization with the Attach and Bind services should be discussed, and
the following items should be addressed.

@itemize @bullet
@item Is auto-initialization, pre-initialization, or both supported for a PPA?

@item Can the method of initialization be restricted on a PPA basis?
@end itemize

Quality of Service (Section 5)
Support of QOS parameter negotiation and selection is a provider-specific issue
that must be described for each implementation.  The DLS provider addendum
documentation should describe which, if any, QOS parameters are supported by the
provider.  For parameters that are negotiated end-to-end, the addendum should
describe whether the provider supports end-to-end negotiation, or whether these
parameters are negotiated in a local manner only.  Finally, default QOS
parameter values should be documented.

DL_@-INFO_@-ACK Values (Section 4.1.3)
@prindex DL_INFO_ACK
The
DL_@-INFO_@-ACK
@prindex DL_INFO_ACK
primitive specifies information on a DLS provider's restrictions
and capabilities.  The DLS provider addendum documentation should describe the
values for all fields in the
DL_@-INFO_@-ACK, and how they are determined (static,
@prindex DL_INFO_ACK
tunable, dynamic).  At a minimum, the addendum must describe the provider style
and the service modes supported by the DLS provider.

Supported Services (Section 3)
The overall services that a specific DLS provider supports should be described.
@cpindex Connection mode
These include whether a provider supports connection-mode service,
connectionless-mode service (acknowledged or OSI Work Group unacknowledged), or
both, and how a DLS user selects the appropriate mode.  For example, the mode
maybe mapped directly to a specific major/minor device, and the user selects an
appropriate mode by opening the corresponding special file.  Alternatively, a
DLS provider that supports both modes may enable a DLS user to select the
service mode on the
DL_@-BIND_@-REQ.
@prindex DL_BIND_REQ

The file name(s) used to access a particular DLS provider and/or specific
service modes of that provider must also be documented.
