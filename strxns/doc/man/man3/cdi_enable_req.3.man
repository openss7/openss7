.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B cdi_enable_req
is a CDI API Library
.[
cdiapi
.]
subroutine.
It issues a
.BR CD_ENABLE_REQ (7)
primitive on the NPI Stream specified by file descriptor, \fIfd\fP, and awaits
and processes either a
.BR CD_ENABLE_CON (7)
primitive confirming the enable request, or a
.BR CD_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive negatively acknowledging the enable request.
.BR cd_put_enable_req (3)
is used to issue to issue the
.BR CD_ENABLE_REQ (7)
primitive, and
.BR cd_wait_ack (3)
is used to await and process the confirmation or negative acknowledgement.
.PP
When the operation is confirmed or negatively acknowledged, upon return, the
area pointed to by \fIstate_ptr\fP, when non-\fBNULL\fP, will contain the CDS
provider's current view of the state of the interface.
.PP
This library call is only valid when the CDI Stream is in the
\fB\)CD_DISABLED\fP state.  The next state upon successful completion is the
\fB\)CD_ENABLED\fP state.
.PP
The function prototype for
.B cdi_enable_req
cannot control the dial type or dial string.  The \fIcd_dial_type\fP member is
always set by this function to \fBCD_NODIAL\fP and the \fIcd_dial_length\fP and
\fIcd_dial_offset\fP members of the
.BR CD_ENABLE_REQ (7)
primitive are set to zero (0).
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
To use the
.B cdi_enable_req
function, include
.RB < sys/cdi.h >
and
.RB < cdiapi.h >
header files in C language programs.
Add the
.RB ` -lcdiapi '
flag to the linker command when linking C language programs that use the
.B cdi_enable_req
function.
.\"
.\"
.SH MT CONTEXT
.PP
.B cdi_enable_req
is fully thread-safe.
What is described as global variables are in fact thread-specific data when
linked with
.BR libpthread .
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
When
.B cdi_enable_req
is successful, it returns one (1), indicating that the
.BR CD_ENABLE_REQ (7)
primtive was issued and confirmed by a
.BR CD_ENABLE_CON (7)
primitive, as is normally the case.  If the \fIstate_ptr\fP argument is
non-\fBNULL\fP, the CDS provider's view of the state of the interface is stored
in the pointed-to extent.
.PP
When
.B cdi_enable_req
is unsuccessful, zero (0) is returned, indicating that the
.BR CD_ENABLE_REQ (7)
primitive was issued, but negatively acknowledged by a
.BR CD_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive.
.
The CDI error number is in
.IR cerrno (3)
and, when
.IR cerrno (3)
is
.BR CD_SYSERR ,
.IR errno (3)
holds the \fBLinux\fP system error number.  If the \fIstate_ptr\fP argument is
non-\fBNULL\fP, the CDS provider's view of the state of the interface is stored
in the pointed-to extent.
.PP
When
.B cdi_enable_req
fails, it returns a negative integer value (-1).
.
The CDI error number is
.IR cerrno (3)
and, when
.IR cerrno (3)
is
.BR CD_SYSERR ,
.IR errno (3)
holds the \fBLinux\fP system error number.
.
The area pointed to by the \fIstate_ptr\fP is unaffected.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.B cdi_enable_req
is unsuccessful or fails, it returns zero (0) or a negative integer value (-1).
.
.B cdi_enable_req
is unsuccessfull or fails when:
.PP
A CDI provider error occurs:
.TP \w'[\fB\)CD_PROTOSHORT\fP]\(em'u
.RB [ CD_BADDIAL ]
dial information was invalid.
.TP
.RB [ CD_BADDIALTYPE ]
invalid dial information type.
.TP
.RB [ CD_BADPRIM ]
unrecognized primitive.
.TP
.RB [ CD_EVENT ]
protocol-specific event occurred.
.TP
.RB [ CD_FATALERR ]
device has become unusable.
.TP
.RB [ CD_INITFAILED ]
line initialization failed.
.TP
.RB [ CD_NOTSUPP ]
primitive not supported by this device.
.TP
.RB [ CD_OUTSTATE ]
primitive was issued from an invalid state.
.TP
.RB [ CD_PROTOSHORT ]
.BR M_PROTO (9)
block too short.
.TP
.RB [ CD_SYSERR ]
A \fBLinux\fP system error occurred and the \fBLinux\fP system error code is
contained in the \fIerrno\fP(3) global variable.
.PP
A \fBLinux\fP system error occurs:
.TP \w'[\fB\)CD_PROTOSHORT\fP]\(em'u
.RB [ ELIBACC ]
The CDI API library was not initialized.  See \fBcdi_init\fP(3).
.TP
.RB [ EBADF ]
the file descriptor, \fIfd\fP, supplied does not correspond to a valid CDI
Stream open for reading and writing.
.TP
.RB [ EINVAL ]
one or more of the arguments are invalid.
.TP
.RB [ ETIMEDOUT ]
the call timed out awaiting a \fB\)CD_ENABLE_CON\fP(7) or
\fB\)CD_ERROR_ACK\fP(7) primitive.  The default time for which these primitives
are awaited is \fB15000\fP milliseconds (15 seconds).
.TP
.RB [ EINTR ]
the call was interrupted by a signal before it could complete.
.TP
.RB [ ERESTART ]
the call was interrupted by a signal before it could begin.
.TP
.RB [ ERESTARTSYS ]
See [\fBERESTART\fP].
.TP
.RB [ EAGAIN ]
the call was non-blocking and a message was not immediately available or
flow control was in effect.
.TP
.RB [ EBADMSG ]
a message of the incorrect type was waiting on the Stream.
.PP
In addition, any of the error number returned by
.BR cdi_put_proto (3)
or
.BR cdi_wait_ack (3)
can be returned by
.BR cdi_enable_req .

.SH NOTICES
.PP
.B cdi_enable_req
is a
.IR GCOM -specific
function.  It may be necessary to define the C preprocessor symbol,
.BR _GCOM_SOURCE ,
before including the
.RB < sys/cdi.h >
header file,
to expose this symbolic constants, data structures and declarations necessary
for the use of this function.
It may also be necessary to include the
.RB < cdiapi.h >
header file
to expose this symbolic constants, data structures and declarations necessary
for the use of this function.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
.B cdi_enable_req
is compatible with the
.I GCOM
CDI API Library,
.[
npiapi
.]
and system providing an interface equivalent to the
.I GCOM
CDI API Library,
with the following portability considerations:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
The earlier versions of the CDI API library were unable to dial a modem.  For
support in later version, see
.BR cdi_dial_req (3)
and
.BR cdi_put_dial_req (3)
for library calls that accept dial strings.
.IP \(em
.B cdi_enable_req
blocks awaiting a response regardless of the blocking or non-blocking flag
settings associated with the open file descriptor.  That is, the function
internally uses
.BR poll (2s).
.IP \(em
.B CDI API Library
functions are
.IR GCOM -specific,
and are provided only for porting
.IR GCOM
software to
.BR Linux .
They are inherently non-portable.  These functions will be avoided by portable
CDI programs.
.IP \(em
Binary compatibility is not attempted, only source compatibility: any binary
compatibility experienced is coincidental and may change on a future release.
It may be necessary to recompile all \fISTREAMS\fP drivers and modules that
share definitions with the CDI API library using
.B @PACKAGE_TITLE@
supplied header files.
