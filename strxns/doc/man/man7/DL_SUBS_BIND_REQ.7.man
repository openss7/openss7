.TH DL_SUBS_BIND_REQ 7 "$Date: 2004/07/11 09:08:24 $" "$Name:  $" "Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI)"
.SH NAME
.B DL_SUBS_BIND_REQ (dl_subs_bind_req_t)
\- requests the DLS provider bind a subsequent DLSAP to the stream.  The DLS
user must identify the address of the subsequent DLSAP to be bound to the
stream.
.SH SYNOPSIS
The message consists of one
.B M_PROTO
message block, which contains the following structure.
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    t_uscalar_t  dl_primitive;
    t_uscalar_t  dl_subs_sap_offset;
    t_uscalar_t  dl_subs_sap_length;
    t_uscalar_t  dl_subs_bind_class;
} dl_subs_bind_req_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.I dl_primitive
conveys
.BR DL_SUBS_BIND_REQ .
.TP
.I dl_subs_sap_offset
conveys the offset of the DLSAP from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
block.
.TP
.I dl_subs_sap_length
conveys the length of the specified DLSAP.
.TP
.I dl_subs_bind_class
specifies either peer or hierarchical addressing:
.RS
.TP
.B DL_PEER_BIND
specifies peer addressing.  The DLSAP specified is used in lieu of the DLSAP
bound in the BIND request.
.TP
.B DL_HIERARCHICAL_BIND
specifies hierarchical addressing.  The DLSAP specified is used in addition
to the DLSAP specified using the BIND request.
.RE
.SH STATE
The message is valid in state
.BR DL_IDLE .
.SH "NEW STATE"
The resulting state is
.BR DL_SUBS_BIND_PND .
.SH RESPONSE
If the subsequent bind request is successful,
.BR DL_SUBS_BIND_ACK (7)
is sent to the DLS user resulting in state
.BR DL_IDLE .
If the request fails, message
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7)
is returned and the resulting state
is unchanged.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B DL_ACCESS
The DLS user did not have proper permission to use the requested
DLSAP address.
.TP
.B DL_BADADDR
The DLSAP address information was invalid or was in an incorrect
format.
.TP
.B DL_OUTSTATE
The primitive was issued from an invalid state.
.TP
.B DL_SYSERR
A System error has occurred and the Linux system error is indicated in
the
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7).
.TP
.B DL_TOOMANY
Limit exceeded on the maximum number of DLSAPs per stream.
.TP
.B DL_UNSUPPORTED
Requested addressing class not supported.
