.TH DL_SUBS_UNBIND_REQ 7 "$Date: 2004/07/04 01:13:14 $" "$Name:  $" "Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI)"
.SH NAME
.B DL_SUBS_UNBIND_REQ (dl_subs_unbind_req_t)
\- requests the DLS Provider to unbind the DLSAP that had been bound
by aprevious
.BR DL_SUBS_BIND_REQ (7)
from this stream.
.SH SYNOPSIS
The message consists of one
.B M_PROTO
message block, which contains the following structure:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    t_uscalar_t  dl_primitive;
    t_uscalar_t  dl_subs_sap_offset;
    t_uscalar_t  dl_subs_sap_length;
} dl_subs_unbind_req_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.I dl_primitive
conveys
.BR DL_SUBS_UNBIND_REQ .
.TP
.I dl_subs_sap_offset
conveys the offset of the DLSAP from the beginning of the
.B M_PROTO
block.
.TP
.I dl_subs_sap_length
conveys the length of the specified DLSAP.
.SH STATE
The message is valid in state
.BR DL_IDLE .
.SH "NEW STATE"
The resulting state is
.BR DL_SUBS_UNBIND_PND .
.SH RESPONSE
If the unbind request is successful, a
.BR DL_OK_ACK (7)
is sent to the DLS User.  The resulting state is
.BR DL_IDLE .
If the request fails, message
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7)
is returned and the resulting state is unchanged.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B DL_BADADDR
The DLSAP address information was invalid or was in an incorrect
format.
.TP
.B DL_OUTSTATE
The primitive was issued from an invalid state
.TP
.B DL_SYSERR
A system error has occurred and the Linux system error is indicated in the
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7).
