.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B DLC_QUERY_LS
input-output control queries statistics of a particular link station (LS).
.PP
Both service access point (SAP) and link station (LS) statistics can be queried
by a GLDC user.  Link station (LS) statistics consist of the current station
states and various reliability, availability, and servicability counters that
monitor the activity of the station fomr the time it is started.
.PP
The argument to the
.B DLC_ADDR_FUNC_ADDR
input-output control is a pointer to a
.B dlc_qls_arg
structure, formatted as follows:
.PP
.nf
\f(CW\s-1\
struct dlc_ls_counters {
    uint32_t test_cmds_sent;
    uint32_t test_cmds_fail;
    uint32_t test_cmds_rec;

    uint32_t data_pkt_resent;
    uint32_t max_cont_resent;

.PP
The
.B dlc_qls_arg
structure contains the following members:
.TP
.I gdlc_sap_corr
Specifies the generic data link control (GDLC) service access point (SAP)
correlator of the target LS.
.TP
.I gdlc_ls_corr
Specifies the generic data link Control (GDLC) link station (LS) to be queried.
.TP
.I user_sap_corr
Indicates the user SAP correlator returned for routing purposes.
.TP
.I user_ls_corr
Indicates the user LS correlator, that is the user LS identifier returned for
routing purposes.
.TP
.I ls_diag
Indicates the link station (LS) diagnostic tag.  Indicates the ASCII character
string tag passed to GDLC at the
.BR DLC_START_LS (4)
input-output control operation to identify the station being queried.  For
example, SNA services puts the attachment profile name in this field.
.TP
.I ls_state
Indicates the current state of the LS.  This is one of the following values:
.RS
.TP
.B DLC_OPENING

.TP
.B DLC_OPENED
Indicates the SAP or link station has been opened.
.TP
.B DLC_CLOSING
Indicates the SAP or link station is in the process of closing.
.TP
.B DLC_INACTIVE
Indicates the link station is currently inactive.
.RE
.TP
.I ls_sub_state
Indicates the current substate of this LS.  Several indicators may be active
concurrently.
.RS
.TP
.B DLC_CALLING

Indicates the local link station is currently busy.
.TP
.B DLC_REMOTE_BUSY
Indicates the remote link station is currently busy.
.RE
.TP
.I dlc_ls_counters 
Indictates the link station reliablity, availability, servicability counters.
These 14 reliability, availability, servicability counters are shown as an
example only.  Each GDLC device manager provides as many of these counters as
necessary to diagnose specific network problems for its protocol type.
.RS
.TP
.B test_cmds_sent
Indicates the number of test command sent.
.TP
.B test_cmds_fail
Indicates the number of test commands failed.
.TP
.B test_cmds_rec

.TP
.B data_pkt_sent
Indicates the number of sequenced data packets sent.
.TP
.B data_pkt_resent
Indicates the number of sequenced data packets resent.
.TP
.B max_cont_resent
Indicates the maximum number of contiguous resendings.
.TP
.B data_pkt_rec
Indicates the number of data packets received.
.TP
.B inv_pkt_rec
Indicates the number of invalid packets received.
.TP
.B adp_rec_err
Indicates the number of data-detected receive errors.
.TP
.B adp_send_err
Indicates the number of data-detected transmit errors.
.TP
.B rec_inact_to
Indicates the number of received inactivity timeouts.
.TP
.B cmd_polls_sent
Indicates the number of command polls sent.
.TP
.B cmd_repolls_sent
Indicates the number of comand repolls sent.
.TP
.B cmd_cont_repolls
Indicates the maximum number of continuous repolls sent.
.RE
.TP
.I protodd_len
Indicates the length of protocol-dependent data.  This field contains the byte
length of the following area.
.PP
The protocol-dependent data contains any additional statistics that a
particular GDLC device manager might provide.  See the individual GDLC
specifications for information on the specific fields returned.  This optional
data area must directly follow (or append to) the end of the
.B dlc_qls_arg
structure.
.\"
.\"
.SH RETURN
.PP
Upon success, the input-output control returns zero (0).  Upon failure, the
input-output control returnes minus one (-1) and sets
.BR errno (3)
to an appropriate error code.
.\"
.\"
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When the input-output control fails, it returns minus one (-1) and set the
.BR errno (3)
to an appropriate error code.  In addition to the reasons given in
.BR ioctl (2s),
this input-output control can fail because of the following:
.TP \w'[\fBEDEADLK\fP]\(em'u
.RB [ EINVAL ]
A parameter of the input-output control is invalid.
.TP
.RB [ EFAULT ]
A memory extent exceeds the callers valid address space.
.TP
.RB [ EPROTO ]
A rule of the interface protocol was violated.
.TP
.RB [ EAGAIN ]
The operation could not be immediately processed.
.TP
.RB [ ENOBUFS ]
There were insufficient message buffers to complete the operation.
.TP
.RB [ ENOSR ]
There were insufficient STREAMS resources to complete the operation.
.TP
.RB [ ENOMEM ]
There was insufficient memory to complete the operation.
.TP
.RB [ EDEADLK ]
A deadlock condition was detected and avoided.

.SH NOTICES
.PP
Note that
.IR AIX \(rg
terminology for GDLC conflict with that of LLC
.[
iso/iec 8802-2 : 1998
.]
and LAPB.
.[
iso7776
.]
Under IEEE terminology, a link station is associated with the MAC entity or a
point-to-point data link endpoint, and one or more service access points (SAP)
are associated with the one link station.  LLC Type 2 supporting link stations
can have associated with them zero or more connections that represent a
connection between a local MAC address and a remote MAC address, a local SAP
and a remote SAP.  LAPB link stations can have associated with them 1
connection that represents a connection between the local and remote stations.
LAPD
.[
q921
.]
link stations can have associated with them one or more connections that
represent a connection associated with a local and remote SAP (TEI).
LAPF
.[
q922
.]
link stations can have associated with them one or more connections that
represent a connection associated with a local and remote SAP (DLCI).
.PP
.IR AIX \(rg
terminology in the GDLC documentation refers to this latter connection,
confusingly, as a link station (LS).
The
.IR AIX \(rg
GDLC service access point (SAP) is really a Physical Point of Attachment (PPA) and
DLSAP combination under the DLPI,
.[
dlpi revision 2.0.0
.]
and the
.IR AIX \(rg
GDLC link station (LS) is really a connection identifier.
It may be helpful to think of a GDLC link station (LS) as an identifier of a
local and remote link station combination for a given DLSAP.
.PP
.B DLC_QUERY_LS
is an
.IR AIX \(rg-specific
input-output control.
It might be necessary to define C preprocessor symbol
.B _AIX_SOURCE
before including the
.RB < sys/dlpi.h >,
.RB < sys/dlpi_ext.h >,
or
.RB < sys/dlpi_ioctl.h >
header files to expose the definitions, structures and declarations associated
with the input-output control.
