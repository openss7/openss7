         element of the object identifier.  When coded as an integer, 
         because of the way that object identifiers are BER encoded, the 
         value might be displayed as two elements.
         
         This parameter defines further qualification as to the probable 
         cause of the alarm.  Probable cause values for notifications 
         shall be indicated in the behaviour clause of the object class

SpecificIdentifier ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
        "Provides the specification of the syntax of the identification 
         of a specific problem.  It is either an object identifier or an 
         integer.  When valued as an integer, the integer is coded in 
         the first an donly element of the object identifier.  When 
         coded as an integer, because of the way that non-relative

SpecificProblems ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
        "This parameter, when present, identifies further refinements to 
         the probable cause of the alarm.  This parameter qualifies the 
         chosen probable cause and may be used by the managed object 
         class definer to specify a set of identifiers for use in 
         managed object classes.
         
         This parameter is either a set of integers or a set of object 
         identifiers.  However, only object identifiers shall be used 
         within the system management context defined in ITU-T Rec.  
         X.701 | ISO/IEC 10040.
         
         This is either an object identifier or an integer.  When valued

         element of the object identifier.
         When coded as an integer, because of the way that object 
         identifiers are BER encoded, the value will likely be displayed

PerceivedSeverity ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
        "This parameter defines six severity levels that provide an 
         indication of how it is perceived that the capability of the 
         managed object has been affected.  Those severity levels that 
         represent service affecting conditions ordered from most sever 
         to lease severe are Critical, Major, Minor and Warning.  The 
         levels defined for use with this mandatory parameter of alarm 
         notifications are:
         
         - cleared: The Cleared severity level indicates the clearing of 
           one or more previously reported alarms.  This alarm clears 
           all alarms for this managed object that have the same Alarm 
           type, Probable cause and Specific problems (if given).  
           Multiple associated notifications may be cleared by using the 
           Correlated notifications parameter (defined below).  ITU-T 
           Rec.  X.733 | ISO/IEC 10164-2 does not require that the 
           clearing of previously reported alarms be reported.  
           Therefore, a managing system cannot assume that the absence 
           of an alarm with the Cleared severity level means that the 
           condition that caused the generation of previous alarms is 
           still present. Managed object definers shall state if, and 
           under which conditions, the Cleared severity level is used.
         
         - indeterminate: The Indeterminate severity level indicates 
           that the severity level cannot be determined.
         
         - critical: The Critical severity level indicates that a 
           service affecting condition has occurred and an immediate 
           corrective action is required. Such a severity can be 
           reported, for example, when a managed object becomes totally 
           out of service and its capability must be restored.
         
         - major: The Major severity level indicates that a service 
           affecting condition has developed and an urgent corrective 
           action is required. Such a severity can be reported, for 
           example, when there is a severe degradation in the capability 
           of the managed object and its full capability must be 
           restored.
         
         - minor: The Minor severity level indicates the existence of a 
           non-service affecting fault condition and that corrective 
           action should be taken in order to prevent a more serious 
           (for example, service affecting) fault. Such a severity can 
           be reported, for example, when the detected alarm condition 
           is not currently degrading the capacity of the managed 
           object.
         
         - warning: The Warning severity level indicates the detection 
           of a potential or impending service affecting fault, before 
           any significant effects have been felt. Action should be 
           taken to further diagnose (if necessary) and correct the 
           problem to prevent it from becoming a more serious service 
           affecting fault.
         
         This is the perceived severity of an alarm defined in 
         accordance with the definitions in the OSI SMI.  When it 
         appears within a scalar defined for use in a notification, it 
         represents the severity of the notification.  Under OSI SMI, 
         the perceived severity is used to indicate both the onset of an 
         alarm condition and the clearing of an alarm condition.
         
         When set to any value other than cleared(5), the notification 
         represents the onset of the alarm corresponding to the 
         notification with a severity level indicated by the value.  
         Normal telecommunications warning, minor, major, critical alarm 
         indications can be indicated.  (Note that the setting of 
         indeterminate(0) is only applied when none of the other 
         characterizations will suffice.)
         
         When set to to cleared(5), the notification represents the 
         clearing of the alarm condition corresponding to the 
         notification."

        "This parameter, when present, specifies whether or not the

TrendIndication ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
        "This parameter, when present, specifies the current severity 
         trend of the managed object. If present it indicates that there 
         are one or more alarms ('outstanding alarms') which have not 
         been cleared, and pertain to the same managed object as that to 
         which this alarm ('current alarm') pertains. The Trend 
         indication parameter has three possible values:
         
         - more severe: The Perceived severity in the current alarm is 
           higher (more severe) than that reported in any of the 
           outstanding alarms;
         
         - no change: The Perceived severity reported in the current 
           alarm is the same as the highest (most severe) of any of the 
           outstanding alarms;
           
         - less severe: There is at least one outstanding alarm of a 
           severity higher (more severe) than that in the current alarm.
         
         For Trend indication to be meaningful, the Perceived severity 
         parameter value of each alarm that may be emitted by the 
         managed object must be defined consistently over all of the 
         defined alarm types for that managed object class. Trend 
         indication information is of particular use to managing systems 
         which receive alarm reports from an event forwarding 
         discriminator configured to pass alarms above a Perceived 
         severity level. The severity trend can also be determined by a 
         managing system that monitors the Perceived severity parameter 
         in received alarm reports.
         
         The Trend indication parameter shall not be present if there 
         are no outstanding alarms.
         
         The absence of the Trend indication parameter cannot be taken

ThresholdInfo ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
        "This parameter shall be present when the alarm is a result of 
         crossing a threshold. It consists of four subparameters.
         
         - triggered threshold: The identifier of the threshold 
           attribute that caused the notification;
         
         - threshold level: In the case of a gauge the threshold level 
           specifies a pair of threshold values, the first being the 
           value of the crossed threshold and the second, its 
           corresponding hysteresis; in the case of a counter the 
           threshold level specifies only the threshold value.
         
         - observed value: The value of the gauge or counter which 
           crossed the threshold. This may be different from the 
           threshold value if, for example, the gauge may only take on 
           discrete values.
         
         - arm time: For a gauge threshold, the time at which the 
           threshold was last re-armed, namely the time after the 
           previous threshold crossing at which the hysteresis value of 
           the threshold was exceeded thus again permitting generation 
           of notifications when the threshold is crossed. For a counter 
           threshold, the later of the time at which the threshold 
           offset was last applied, or the time at which the counter was 
           last initialized (for resettable counters)."

         - repair action required: This value is used to indicate that 
           the manager is required to initiate repair action to correct 
           the problem reported in the alarm report.  This value also 
           indicates that no specific repair action is proposed by the 
           agent system.
         
         This is either an object identifier or an integer.  When valued

         This is either an object identifier or an integer.  When valued 
         as an integer, the integer is coded in the first and only 
         element of the object identifier.
         When coded as an integer, because of the way that object 
         identifiers are BER encoded, the value will likely be displayed 
         as two elements."

         The admninistrative state textual convention is single valued 
         and read-write.  It can have one of the following values, not 
         all of which are applicable to every class of managed object:
         
         - locked: The resource is administratively prohibited from 
           performing services for its users.
         
         - unlocked: The resource is administratively permitted to 
           perform services for its users.  This is independent of its 
           inherent operability.
         
         - shutting down: Use of the resource is administratively 
           permitted to existing instances of use only.  While the 
           system remains in the shutting down state, the manager may at 
           any time cause the managed object to revert to the unlocked 
           state.
         
         Precise definition of the states is specific to the managed 
         object represented.
         
         When placed in a column of a conceptual table, this textual 
         convention is given an MAX-ACCESS of read-write or read-create, 
         permitting management stations the ability to set the value.
         
         Values that can be set are locked(0), unlocked(1) or 
         shuttingDown(2).  The actions performed when set to locked(0), 
         unlocked(1) or shuttingDown(2) will be described specifically 
         in the DESCRIPTION section for the object. however, in general, 
         setting the object to locked(0) results in immediate and 
         disruptive withdrawal from service of the object represented by 
         the row and all contained objects.  Setting the object to 
         shuttingDown(2) results in the graceful withdrawal from service 
         of the object represented by the row and all contained objects.  
         Setting the object to unlocked(1) results in placing back into 
         service the represented object and all contained objects that 
         do not have an administrative state of their own, or that have 
         an administrative state which is also unlocked(1).
         
         The default value associated with this row is locked(0) and the

    DESCRIPTION 
        "This texutal convention represents the alarm status of an 
         managed object in accordance with the definitions in the OSI

         refers to the alarm status of the managed object represented by 
         the row.  Rows in conceptual tables representing managed 
         objects that may generate alarms should contain this textual 
         convention.
         
         The alarm status textual convention is set-valued and 
         read-write.  It can have zero or more of the following values, 
         not all of which are applicable to every class of managed

         - under repair: The resource is currently being repaired.  When 
           the under repair value is present, the operational state is 
           either disabled or enabled.
         
         - critical: One or more citical alarms indicating a fault have 
           been detected in the resource, and have not been cleared.  
           The operational state of the managed object can be disabled 
           or enabled.
         
         - major: One or more major alarms indicating a fault have been 
           detected in the resource, and have not yet been cleared.  The 
           operational state of the managed object can be disabled or 
           enabled.
         
         - minor: One or more minor alarms indicating a fault have been 
           detected in the resource, and have not yet been cleared.  The 
           operational state of the managed object can be disabled or 
           enabled.
         
         - alarm outstanding: One or more alarms have been detected in 
           the resource, the condition of which may or may not be 
           disabling.  If the operational state is enabled, additional 
           attributes, particular to the managed object class, may 
           indicate the nature and cause of the condition and the 
           services that are affected.
         
         The presence of the above alarm state conditions do not 
         suppress the generation of future fault related notifications.
         
         When placed in a column of a conceptual table, this textual

ProceduralStatus ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
        "This is the procedural status of an Entry in accodance with the 
         definitions in ITU-T Recommendation X.731 (1992).  Under X.731 
         the syntax of a ProceduralStatus is a SET OF INTEGER with these 
         defined values, however, SNMP can't do that, so we use BITS 
         instead.  When it appears in an entry in a conceptual table, 
         this textual convention refers to the procedural or active 
         status of the managed object represented by the entry.
         
         The procedural status textual convention is supported only by 
         those managed objects that represent some procedure (e.g, a 
         test process) which progresses through a sequence of phases.  
         Depending upon the managed object class definition, the 
         procedure may be required to reach certain phase for the 
         resource to be operational and available for use (i.e, for the 
         managed object to be enabled).  Not all phases may be 
         applicable to every class of managed object.  If the value of 
         this textual convention is an emtpy set, the managed object is 
         ready, for example, the initialization is complete.
         
         - intialization required: The resource requires initialization 
           to be invoked by the manager before it can perform its normal 
           functions, and this procedure has not been initiated.  The 
           manager may be able to invoke such initialization through an 
           action.  The terminating condition may also be present.  The 
           operational state is disabled.
         
         - not initialized: The resource requires initialization before 
           it can perform its normal functions, and this procedure has 
           not been initiated.  The resource initializes itself 
           autonomously, but the operational state may be either 
           disabled or enabled, depending upon the managed object class 
           definition.
         
         - initializing: The resource requires initialization before it 
           can perform its normal functions, and this procedure has been 
           initiated but is not yet complete.  When this condition is 
           present, the intitialization required condition is absent, 
           since initialization has already begun.  The operational 
           state may be disabled or enabled, depending upon the managed 
           object class defintion.
         
         - terminating: The resource is in a termination phase.  If the 
           resource does not reinitialize itself autonomously, the 
           initialization required condition is also present and the 
           operational state is disabled; otherwise, the operational 
           state may be either disabled or enabled, depending upon the

AvailabilityStatus ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
        "This is the availability status of an Entry in accordance with 
         the definitions in the OSI SMI.  When it appears within a 
         conceptual row it refers to the availability status of the 
         manage objected represented by the conceptual row.
         
         The availability status textual convention is set-valued and 
         read-only.  It can have zero or more of the following values, 
         not all of which are applicable to every class of managed 
         object.  When the value of this attribute is empty, this 
         implies that none of the status conditions described below are 
         present.
         
         - in test: The resource is undergoing a test procedure.  If the 
           administrative state is locked or shutting down then normal 
           users are precluded from using the resource and the control 
           status attribute has the value reserved for test.  Tests that 
           do not exclude additional users can be present in any 
           operational or administrative state but the reserved for test 
           condition should not be present.
         
         - failed: The resource has an internal fault that prevents it 
           from operating.  The operational state is disabled.
         
         - power off: The resource requires power to be applied and is 
           not powered on.  For example, a fuse or other protection 
           device is known to have removed power or a low voltage 
           condition has been detected.  The operational state is 
           disabled.
         
         - offline: The resource requires a routing operation to be 
           performed to place it online and make it available for use.  
           The operation may be manual or automatic, or both.  The 
           operational state is disabled.
         
         - off duty: The resource has been made inactive by an internal 
           control process in accordance with a predetermined time 
           schedule.  Under normal conditions the control process can be 
           expected to reactivate the resource at some scheduled time, 
           and it is therefore considered to be optional.  The 
           operational state is enabled or disabled.
         
         - dependency: The resource cannot operate because some other 
           resource on which it depends is (i.e, a resource not 
           represented by the same managed object) unavailable.  For 
           example, a device is not accessible because its controller is 
           powered off.  The operational state is disabled.
         
         - degraded: The service available from the resource is degraded 
           in some respect, such as in speed or operating capacity.  
           Failure of a teset or an unacceptable performance measurement 
           has established that some or all services are not functional 
           or are degraded due to presence of a defect.  However, the 
           resource remains available for service, either because some 
           services are satisfactory or because degraded service is 
           preferable to no service at all.  Object specific attributes 
           may be deinfed to represent further information indicating, 
           for example, which serivces are not functional and the nature 
           of the degradation.  The operational state is enabled.
         
         - not installed: The resource represented by the managed object 
           is not present, or is incomplete.  For example, a plug-in 
           module is missing, a cable is disconnected or a software 
           module is not loaded.  The operational state is disabled.
         
         - log full: This indicates a log full condition the semantics 
           of which are defined in ITU-T Rec. X.735.
         
         When placed in a column of a conceptual table, this textual 
         convention is given a MAX-ACCESS of read-only, permitting 
         management stations the ability to retrieve the value only.
         
         The default value associated with this row is the empty set 
         ('000000000'B) and the managed object created by the conceptual 
         row is created is an available state.
         
         Precise definition of the states is specific to the managed 
         object represented.  Not all states are applicable to all 
         managed objects.  Precise definitions of which states are 
         applicable and what conditions exist in each applicable state 
         must appear in the DESCRIPTION of the object type definition

ControlStatus ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
        "This textual convention represents the control status of an 
         managed object in accordance with the definitions in ITU-T 
         Recommendation X.731 (1992).  When it appears within a row of a 
         coneceptual table, it refers to the control status of the 
         managed object represented by the row.
         
         The control status textual convention is read-write and 
         set-valued.  It can have zero or more of the following values, 
         not all of which are applicable to every class of managed 
         object.  When the value of this textual convention is empty, 
         this implies that none of the status conditions described below 
         are present.
         
         - subject to test: The resource is available to normal users, 
           but tests may be conducted on it simultaneously at 
           unpredicatble times, which may cause it to exhibit unusual 
           characteristics to users.
         
         - part of services locked: This value indicates whether a 
           manager has administratively restricted a particular part of 
           a service from the user(s) of a resource.  The administrative 
           state is unlocked.  Examples are incoming service barred, 
           outgoing service barred, write locked by media key, read 
           locked.
         
         - reserved for test: The resource has been made 
           administratively unavailable to normal users because it is 
           undergoing a test procedure.  The administrative state is 
           locked.
         
         - suspended: Service has been administratively suspended to the 
           users of the resource.  The resource may retain knowledge of 
           current users and/or requests for usage, depending upon the 
           managed object class definition, but does not resume 
           performing serivces until the suspended condition is revoked.  
           The administrative state is unlocked.
         
         When placed in a column of a conceptual table, this textual 
         convention is given a MAX-ACCESS of read-write or read-create, 
         permitting management stations the ability to set or retrieve

StandbyStatus ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
        "This textual convention represents the standby status of an 
         Entry in accordance with the defintions in ITU-T Recommendation 
         X.731 (1992).  When it appears within a row of a conceptual 
         table it refers to the standby status of the managed object 
         represented by the row.
         
         The standby status textual convention is single-valued and 
         read-only.  It shall have one of the following values.  The 
         value is only meaningful when the back-up relationship role 
         exists.
         
         - hot standby: The resource is not providing service, but is 
           operating in synchronism with another resource that is to be 
           backed-up (e.g, a computer shadowing another computer).  A 
           resource with a hot standby status will be immediately able 
           to take over the role of the resource to be backed-up, 
           without the need for intialization activity, and will contain 
           the same information as the resource being backed up.  The 
           hot standby condition is mutually exclusive with the cold 
           standby and providing service conditions.
           The operational state is enabled.  The administrative state 
           is unlocked.  The availability status is offline.
         
         - cold standby: The resource is to back-up another resource, 
           but is not syncrhonized with that resource.  A resource with 
           a cold standby status will not be immediately able to take 
           over the role of a resource to be backed up, and will require 
           some initialization activity.  The cold standby condition is 
           mutually exclusive with the hot standby and providing service 
           condition.  The operational state is enabled or disabled.  
           The administrative state is locked or unlocked.  The 
           procedural status contains not initialized or initialization 
           required.  The availability status is offline.
         
         - providing service: The back-up resource is providing service 
           and is backing up another resource.  The providing service 
           condition is mutually exclusive with the hot stanbdy and cold 
           standby conditions.  The operational state is enabled.  The 
           administrative state is unlocked.  The availability status is 
           online.
         
         When placed in a column of a conceptual table, this textual

         intervals (interval-start and interval-end times of day) for 
         which the log will exhibit the logging-on condition, if the

communicationsAlarm NOTIFICATION-TYPE

    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
        "This notification type is used to report when the object 
         detects a communications error.
         
         This is one of two mechanisms of providing communications 
         alarms corresponding to TMN alarms.  One method is to provide a 
         single notification which is parameterized in a similar fashion 
         to TMN.  The other method is providing indepdendent 
         notifications for each cause.  The advantages of providing a 
         single notification for communications alarms is that the 
         management station need only monitor a single trap to receive 
         all alarm indications.  On a managed system with thousands of 
         unique alarms, this has scale benefits.
         
         The communicationsAlarm is modelled on the TMN notification of 
         the same name.  TMN too has the ability to provide independent 
         notifications and chose a similar unified alarm notification.
         
         The first parameter of the communicationsAlarm is the probable 
         cause, which is an object identifier defined with the 
         OBJECT-IDENTITY macro.  The probable cause identifies the 
         alarm.  The third parameter (second object in SNMP) is the 
         perceived severity.  Following the PerceivedSeverity textual 
         convention, this parameter indicates when the alarm has onset 
         or cleared, and when indicating onset, the relative severity in 
         telecommunications terms (warning, minor, major, critical).  
         The second parameter (optional additional object in SNMP) is a 
         sequence of specific problems that refined the alarm 
         indication.
         
         Because their values are defined by an OBJECT-IDENTITY macro, 
         the DESCRIPTION clause in that macro defining a probable cause 
         or specific problem should clearly identify the purpose of the 
         alarm, when it is generated, when it is cleared, and how a 
         specific problem refines the probable cause.  This makes this 
         information available to managers via the MIB generating the 
         alarms.  Where a generic value is not used, the probable cause 
         and specific problems should be defined within the MIB module 
         that use them.
         
         State changes and attribute value changes can be reported by 
         simply including the object with the old value and the object 
         with the new value for each object reported."

communicationsInformation NOTIFICATION-TYPE

    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
        "This notification may be used to report the occurrence of 
         events pertaining to the normal operation of a managed object. 
         These are informational events; important enough to report, but 
         not requiring any further action by a manager.  Faults and 
         abnormal conditions (which may require manager action) shall be 
         reported using the event types defined in CCITT Rec.  X.733 
         (1992) | ISO/IEC 10164-4:1992.
         
         The communicationsInformation notification is modelled on the 
         TMN notification of the same name.
         
         The first paraemter of the communicationInformation 
         notification is the information type, which is an object 
         identifier defined with the OBJECT-IDENTITY macro.  The 
         information type identifies the event.
         
         Beacuse its value is defined by an OBJECT-IDENTITY macro, the 
         DESCRIPTION clause in that macro defining an information type 
         should clearly identify the purpose of the event notification, 
         when it is geenrtated, ahd how any information data refines the 
         information type.  This makes this information available to 
         managers via the MIB generating the alarms.  When a generic 
         value is not used, the information type should be defined 
         within the MIB module that issues them."
