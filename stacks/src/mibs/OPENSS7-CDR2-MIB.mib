         - reaching a volumn threshold;

        "callDetailData objects are created and deleted implicitly, that 
         is, they are created and deleted upon the occurrence of defined 
         trigger events and are not explicitly manipulated by a managing 
         system; i.e. a manager cannot perform any operations on 
         instances of this object class. To support recording data in a 
         callDetailData object two sets of triggers coming from the 
         control objects are defined:
         
         - Creation Triggers: events that cause creation of a 
           callDetailData object, these triggers are defined as part of 
           the control object.
         
         - Termination Triggers: events that cause deletion of a 
           callDetailData object.  Currently the termination is implicit 
           as part of the data object behaviour.  Deletion occurs upon 
           completion of usage data collection for that instance of 
           service.
         
         CDR notifications are emitted in response to reporting triggers 
         (ITU-T Rec. X.742) that are also defined as part of 
         the control objects.
         
         Entries in this table generate a callDetailRecordNotification 
         when a reporting trigger has fired."

    DESCRIPTION 
        "simpleUsageMeteringControl object class allows the definition 
         of different types of triggers for usage metering recording.  
         One of the defined reporting triggers requires periodic 
         reporting and can be used to transfer partial service usage 
         data to a log or remote OS for long duration service usage.  
         Another type of trigger is determined by the occurrence of a 
         particular event during usage of the service, e.g. completion 
         of usage. This object class fully supports the requirements for 
         usage metering. If only Usage Metering application is required, 
         then simpleUsageMeteringControl object class shall be used.  
         This object class controls the generation of CDRs in the NE.  
         CDRs are actually produced if the transaction fulfils the 
         conditions defined in the creationTriggerList attribute.  If 
         the creationTriggerList is empty, no CDR will be generated.  
         The value of the time period in reportingTriggers defines the 
         time interval between partial records. No attribute value 
         change notification is sent by this object when data object 
         reference list is changed and no attribute change value 
         reflects this data object reference list."

    DESCRIPTION 
        "Entries in this table are derived from entries in the 
         usageMeteringControlObjectTable in the OPENSS7-UMC-MIB module 
         with the same index of the controlObjectId.
         
         When deleted, the associated entry in the 
         usageMeteringControlObjectTable and the referenced data objects 
         in the dataObjectReferenceTable of the OPENSS7-UMC-MIB module 
         are also deleted.
         
         Note that the associated usageMeteringControlObjectTable 
         entries do not normally support actions taken on data objects 
         and starting, suspending and resuming call detail records one 
         an individual data object by data object basis would be 
         nonsensical.   Suspending CDRs on all data objects for all 
         accontable object references might make sense in some 
         circumstances.
         
         Periodic triggering of CDR reporting from the 
         usageMeteringControlObjectTable has special value for cutting 
         partial records for long-duration calls.  Induced report 
         triggering due to a change in operational state is also 
         possible.  Event driver report triggering can determine at what 
         points in the call a CDR wil be generated.  The controlObject- 
         ReportingTriggersEvent is set valued and may contain:
         
         - registration(0), reporting is triggered upon off-hook or 
           seizure;
         
         - request(1), reporting is triggered when the first digit is 
           received from the origination;
         
         - accept(2), reporting is triggerd when the ACM (last digit) is 
           received;
         
         - complete(3), reporting is triggered when the call is 
           completed and terminating data is available;
         
         - corresponding(4), reporting is triggered when additional data 
           corresponding to the call is available;
         
         - bulk(5), reporting is triggered when bulk data is available 
           (such as mid-call during long-duration calls);
         
         - interruption(6), reporting is triggered whenever an error or 
           an exception occurs (e.g. abnormal release, circuit reset or 
           hardware blocking)."

    DESCRIPTION 
        "This attribute consists of a list of values that specify the 
         conditions that will lead to the creation of Call Detail data 
         objects.  Triggers can be call related (Seizure or first digit 
         or ACM received or ANM received) and non-call related 
         (supplementary service invocation and/or input). When multiple 
         triggers are present, the recording process is activated by the 
         first recordable event.  Note that this mask controls creation 
         and does not control reporting.  The controlObjectReporting-
         Triggers in the UsageMeteringControlObjectTable at the 
         coresponding controlObjectId index is responsible for reporting 
         triggers.
         
         The creation mask provides a specification of a set of triggers 
         for creating usage meter data objects.  The object is 
         set-valued and may contain the following:
         
         - seizure(0), when present, trigger call detail recording 
           creation when the originating trunk is siezed (unless this 
           value is included in the set, seizure time will not be 
           collected);
         
         - firstDigitReceived(1), when present, trigger call detail 
           recording creation when the first digit is received from the 
           origination (unless this value or earlier values are is 
           included in the set, IAM times and associated transient 
           information (e.g. COT) will not be collected);
         
         - aCMReceived(2), when present, trigger call detail recording 
           creation when the ACM (last digit) is received (unless this 
           value or earlier values are included in the set, ACM times 
           and associated transient information will not be collected;
         
         - aNMReceived(3), when present, trigger call detail recording 
           creation when an ANM is received from the termination (unless 
           this value or earlier values are included in the set, ANM 
           times and associated transient information will not be 
           collected);
         
         - supplementaryServiceInvocation(4), when present, trigger call 
           detail recording creation whenever a supplementary service is 
           invoked (unless this value or earlier values are included in 
           the set, supplementary service invocation and any transient 
           data associated with such invocation will not be collected);
         
         - supplementaryServiceInput(5), when present, trigger call 
           detail recording creation whenever a supplementary service 
           input occurs.
         
         aCMreceived(2) is defined as the receipt of ACM for an external 
         call. In the case of a terminating exchange the event ACM 
         received will occur when the ACM is normally generated. This is 
         either when a B-subscriber port is free (early ACM) or when a 
         B-subscriber terminal is free (late ACM).  The choice between 
         early and late ACM is a network option in the terminating 
         network.  For local calls a corresponding time shall be used.
         
         For trunks that have no seizure event (such as SS7 ISUP trunks 
         which only have an IAM or first digit event) the earliest event 
         at which the CDR can be create is at firstDigitReceived(1).  
         Setting seizure(0) on trunks with no seizure has no effect."

supplementaryServices OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX      OCTET STRING (SIZE(4..256))
    MAX-ACCESS  read-only
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION 
        "An octet string representing a list of supplementary services.  
         This is a list of concetenations of a single octet length 
         indicator and a SupplementaryService octet string.
         
         This attribute contains information about the use of one or 
         more supplementary services. Information about the use of one 
         or more supplementary service is only possible in connection 
         with a call record type. Each supplementary service is included 
         as a SEQUENCE OF SupplementaryService.
         
         Each SupplementaryService construct contains relevant 
         information about the use of a supplementary service.  The 
         attribute contains a service code identifying the supplementary 
         service and an addition information about the action taken. An 
         optional time stamp is provided for time dependent charging of 
         supplementary services.  The time stamp is a duration time 
         relative to the startTimeStamp and is recorded in centisecond.
         
         For each service code information is provided indicating the 
         action taken. The following actions are defined:
         
         - Provision of supplementary service;
         - Withdrawal of supplementary service;
         - Registration of supplementary service;
         - Erasure of supplementary service;
         - Activation of supplementary service;
         - Deactivation of supplementary service;
         - Invocation of supplementary service;
         - Disabling of supplementary service;
         - Interrogation of supplementary service;
         
         If provided by the network, actions can be made on 
         supplementary service by the operator. In such a case the 
         service user element in the CDR will indicate the operator as 
         the initiator of the action.
         
         In the case of functional signalling on ISDN further 
         information of the supplementary service usage is provided by 
         the optional functional information field.  This field contains 
         a set of 'management extensions' as defined by ITU-T 
         Rec. X.721."
