5.5.1 Defect Notices
--------------------

"OpenSS7 SS7 Stack" has unknown defects.  This is a "alpha" release.
Some defects could be harmful.  No validation testing whatsoever has
been performed by the `OpenSS7 Project' on this software.  The software
might fail to configure or compile on some systems.  The `OpenSS7
Project' recommends that you do not use this software for purposes
other than develoment or evaluation, and then only with great care. Use
at your own risk.  Remember that there is NO WARRANTY.(1)

This software is alpha software.  As such, it can likely crash your
kernel.  Installation of the software can irreparably mangle your
header files or Linux distribution in such a way as to make it
unusable.  Crashes could lock your system and rebooting the system
might not repair the problem.  You can possibly loose all the data on
your system.  Because this software can crash your kernel, the
resulting unstable system could destroy computer hardware or
peripherals making them unusable.  You could void the warranty on any
system on which you run this software.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

manual.

5.5.2 Known Defects
-------------------

With the exception of packages not originaly created by the `OpenSS7
Project', the `OpenSS7 Project' software does not ship with known bugs
in any release stage except "pre-alpha".  "OpenSS7 SS7 Stack" had no
known bugs at the time of release.

5.5.3 Defect History
--------------------

This section contains historical bugs that were encountered during
development and their resolutions.  This list serves two purposes:

  1. It captures bugs encountered between releases during development
     that could possibly reoccur (and the Moon is made of blue cheese).
     It therefore provides a place for users to look if they encounter
     a problem.

  2. It provides a low overhead bug list between releases for
     developers to use as a `TODO' list.
