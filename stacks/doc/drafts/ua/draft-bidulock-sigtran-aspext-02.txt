1.  Introduction

1.1.  Scope

     This Internet-Draft provides parameters and procedures in extension
  to the parameters and procedures of the Signalling User Adaptation
  Layers (UAs) [IUA..SUA, IUA-BIS..TUA], for the purpose of supporting a

Internet Draft                  UA ASPEXT                  July 26, 2003

  ASP Extension (ASPEXT) - An extension to one or more of the the UAs
      that requires identification of the capabilities of the SPP to
      support the extension as part of its requirements.

  Signalling Peer Process (SPP) - refers to an ASP, SGP or IPSP.

  Signalling User Adaptation Layer (UA) - one or more of the Stream
      Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [RFC 2960] ISDN Signalling
      User Adaptation Layers [IUA, IUA-BIS..GR303UA00] or SS7 Signalling
      User Adaptation Layers [M2UA..SUA, ISUA, TUA].  supporting the
      concept of ASP Management[1].

1.4.  Overview

     There is a need to provide extensions for the Signalling User
  Adaptation Layer protocols that require interworking between
  Signalling Peer Processes (SPPs) implementing a specific extension and
  SPPs not implementing the extension.

     ASPEXT provides parameters and procedures that allow Signalling
  Peer Processes (SPPs) implementing a given set of extensions to
  indicate its support to other SPPs as well as to discover the support
  for extensions provided by peer SPPs.

1.4.1.  Existing Extension Management

     The existing UA procedures[2] make no provisions for the management
  of extensions.  Any mechanism that an SPP might use to determine the
  extension support of peer SPPs depends upon implementation dependent
  configuration information or protocols between SPPs.

     For example, if an ASP implements and extension that requires that
  the ASP have knowledge of whether a peer SGP supports the extension,
  the ASP would have to be configured with this SGP-specific
  information, or would need to use some implementation-dependent
  mechanism to determine this information.

     The lack of an IETF procedure for managing extension support
  represents a deficiency of the existing UA procedures[2] that detracts
  from interoperability between separate implementations of SPP peers.

1.4.2.  ASP Extension Management

     ASPEXT provide support for the following:

   + Support for an SPP indicating to peer SPPs the extensions that are
     supported.
   + Support for an SPP discovering what extensions are supported by
     peer SPPs.
   + Support for an SPP supporting ASPEXT interworking with an SPP that
     does not support ASPEXT.

3.  Protocol Elements

     ASPEXT provides the following parameters and the messages in which
  they are included in addition to the parameters of the UAs.[1]

3.1.  Parameters

     ASPEXT provides the following parameters in addition to the
  parameters defined for the UAs.[1]

3.1.1.  ASP Extensions

     The ASP Extensions parameter is a common parameter used in the
  ASPUP and ASPUP ACK messages to identify the extension capabilities of
  the ASP (ASPUP) and the extension capabilities of the SGP or IPSP
  (ASPUP ACK).

     The ASP Extensions parameter is formatted as follows: [2]

     0                   1                   2                   3

Internet Draft                  UA ASPEXT                  July 26, 2003

     The ASP Extensions parameter contains one or more of the following
  fields:

  ASP Extension field: 32-bits (unsigned integer)

    The ASP Extension field contains an IANA registered extension
    identifier number that identifies the extension supported by the ASP
    in an ASPUP or an extension supported by the SGP or IPSP in an ASPUP
    ACK.  Examples of valid values for the ASP Extension field are as
    follows:

        0   None
        1   Protocol Limits Extension [SGINFO]
        2   Load Selection Extension [LOADSEL]
        3   Load Grouping Extension [LOADGRP]
        4   Correlation Id and Heartbeat Extension [CORID]
        5   Registration Extension [REGEXT]
        6   Session Identification Extension [SESSID]
        7   Dynamic Registration Option
        8   Double-Ended (DE) IPSP Model Option [M3UAIG]
        -   (All other values are IETF reserved.)

    Each occurrence of an ASP Extension field indicates that the sending
    SPP supports the specified extension.  The ASP Extension parameter
    MUST contain at least one ASP Extension value.  An ASP Extension
    field containing the value "None" MUST be the only ASP Extension
    field included in the ASP Extension parameter.

3.2.  Messages

     ASPEXT extends the following messages defined for the UAs.[1]

3.2.1.  ASP Up (ASPUP)

     ASPEXT supplements the ASPUP message by permitting the following
  optional parameters to be included in the message:

4.  Procedures

     The following procedures are provided in extension to the UA
  procedures by ASPEXT.

4.1.  ASP Management Procedures

Internet Draft                  UA ASPEXT                  July 26, 2003

4.1.1.  ASP Up Procedures

     In extension of the "ASP Up Procedures" of the UAs[2], ASPEXT
  provides the following procedures:

     Whenever an ASP, as part of the normal UA procedures, sends an ASP
  Up (ASPUP) message to an SGP or IPSP it MAY include the ASP Extensions
  parameter indicating the extensions supported by the ASP.

     Upon receiving an ASP Up (ASPUP) message from an ASP that contains
  the ASP Extensions parameter, an SGP or IPSP supporting ASPEXT MUST
  register the ASP's support of the specified extensions and MUST place
  an ASP Extensions parameter of its own in the responding ASP Up
  Acknowledgment (ASPUP ACK) indicating which of the extensions provided
  in the ASPUP are supported.

     If an SGP or IPSP supporting ASPEXT receives an ASPUP message that
  does not contain an ASP Extensions parameter, the SGP or IPSP MAY
  assume that the ASP does not support any extensions, or MAY rely on
  internal configuration data to determine the extensions supported by
  the ASP.  The SGP or IPSP SHOULD NOT include the ASP Extensions
  parameter in the responding ASPUP ACK message.

     Upon receiving an ASP Up Acknowledgment (ASPUP ACK) containing an
  ASP Extensions parameter, an ASP supporting ASPEXT MUST register the
  SGP or IPSP's support of the specified extensions.

     If an SPP supporting ASPEXT receives an ERR message indicating the
  ASP Extensions parameter as an "Invalid Parameter" in response to an
  ASPUP or ASPUP ACK message, the SPP SHOULD re-attempt sending the
  ASPUP or ASPUP ACK message without the ASP Extensions parameter.

4.1.2.  ASP Down Procedures

     In extension to the "ASP Down Procedure" of the UAs[2], ASPEXT
  provides the following procedures:

     Whenever an ASP, as part of the normal UA procedures, sends an ASP
  Down (ASPDN) message to an SGP or IPSP, the ASP supporting ASPEXT
  SHOULD clear any ASP Extensions previously registered while the ASP
  was in the ASP-UP state for the SGP.

     Upon sending an ASP Down Acknowledgment (ASPDN ACK), either in
  response to an ASPDN or unsolicited, an SGP supporting ASPEXT SHOULD
  clear any ASP Extensions previously registered while the ASP was in
  the ASP-UP state at the SGP.

5.  Examples

5.1.  Both ASP and SGP/IPSP support ASP Extensions

     Figure 1 illustrates an example where both the ASP and the SGP or
  IPSP support ASPEXT.

          Figure 1.  Both ASP and SGP/IPSP support ASP Extensions


     The example sequence of events for the example illustrated in
  Figure 1 is as follows:

   (1)   An SCTP Association is established or the ASP is otherwise in
         the ASP-DOWN state.

   (2)   The ASP sends an ASPUP message to the SGP or IPSP containing an
         ASP Extensions parameter identifying (for example) two
         extensions: Load Selection [LOADSEL] and Correlation
         Id/Heartbeat [CORID]; indicating the ASP's support for these
         two extensions requiring interworking support.

   (3)   The SGP or IPSP responds with an ASPUP ACK message containing
         an ASP Extensions parameter identifying (for example) support
         for only one extension: Load Selection [LOADSEL]

   (4)   The ASP and SGP/IPSP register the peer's support (or lack of
         support) for the LOADSEL and CORID extensions and modify
         subsequent procedures accordingly.

     The example sequence of events for the example illustrated in
  Figure 2 is as follows:

   (1)   An SCTP Association is established or the ASP is otherwise in
         the ASP-DOWN state.

   (2)   The ASP sends an ASPUP message to the SGP or IPSP containing an
         ASP Extensions parameter identifying (for example) two
         extensions: Load Selection [LOADSEL] and Correlation
         Id/Heartbeat [CORID]; indicating the ASP's support for these
         two extensions requiring interworking support.

   (3)   The SGP or IPSP ignores the ASP Extensions parameter in the
         ASPUP and responds with an ASPUP ACK message containing no ASP
         Extensions parameter.

   (4)   The ASP either assumes that the SGP or IPSP does not support
         the LOADSEL or CORID extensions, or relies upon configuration
         data to indicate the SGP or IPSP's support for these
         extensions.  The ASP modifies its subsequent procedures with
         regard to the extension accordingly.

     The example sequence of events for the example illustrated in
  Figure 3 is as follows:

   (1)   An SCTP Association is established or the ASP is otherwise in

6.  Security

     ASPEXT does not introduce any new security risks or considerations
  that are not already inherent in the UA [IUA..SUA, IUA-BIS..TUA].
  Please see the SIGTRAN security document [SIGSEC] for security
  considerations and recommendations that are applicable to each of
  these UAs.

     It is possible that an attacker or malicious endpoint might
  manipulate the ASP Extensions parameter in an attempt to cause denial
  of service attacks on either an SGP or ASP.  However, because each
  extension has a fall back procedure which provides for interworking
  without the ASPEXT capability, ASPEXT introduces no further threat if
  the endpoint adheres to the following rule:


B. Bidulock                    Version 0.2                       Page 12

Internet Draft                  UA ASPEXT                  July 26, 2003

     Although an endpoint has registered an ASP extension against a peer
  endpoint, the registering endpoint SHOULD take this information as
  advisory and continue to effect interworking and fullback procedures
  in the event that the information in the ASP Extensions parameter is
  malicious, in error, or invalid.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Extensions

     ASPEXT provides an additional ASP Extensions message parameter to
  the common parameter range of the SIGTRAN UAs [IUA..SUA, IUA-
  BIS..TUA]:

   (a)   The parameter is named the ASP Extensions parameter.

   (b)   The structure of the ASP Extensions parameter field conforms to
         the UA general TLV format and is described in detail in Section
         3.1.1.

   (c)   The detailed definition of each component of the ASP Extensions
         parameter values is described in Section 3.1.1.

   (d)   This document also provides a detailed description of the
         intended use of the ASP Extensions[1] parameter, and in which
         messages the ASP Extensions parameter should appear, how many
         times, and when.

7.2.  Protocol Extensions

     UA protocols may be extended through IANA in three ways:

   + through definition of additional message classes;

   + through definition of additional message types; and,

   + through definition of additional message parameters.

     The definition and used of new message classes, types and
  parameters is an integral part of the SIGTRAN adaptation layers.
  Thus, these extensions are assigned by IANA through an IETF Consensus
  action [RFC 2434].

     The proposed extension MUST in no way adversely affect the general
  working of the protocol.

     To permit interoperability of implementations supporting a
  particular extension with implementation not supporting that
  extension, a UA Extension number can be assigned to a protocol
  extension in accordance with this document.  A new registry will be
  created by IANA to allow:

Internet Draft                  UA ASPEXT                  July 26, 2003

7.2.1.  IETF Defined UA Protocol Extension

     In additional to the documentation required for each message class,
  message type and message parameter extension, the documentation of the
  UA Protocol Extension number MUST include the following information:

   (a)   A long and short name for the Extension.

   (b)   A detailed description of the the purpose of the Extension.

   (c)   A detailed description of the Message Classes, Types and
         Parameters provided by the extension.

   (d)   A detailed description of the interworking between UA
         implementations supporting the Extension and UA implementations
         not supporting the Extension.

Notes for Section 7

  [1]  EDITOR'S NOTE:-  The ASP Extensions parameter tag value shown
       throughout this document as 0xXXXX will be assigned by IANA
       within the common parameter range of the SIGTRAN UAs and may
       change its value in further versions of this document.
