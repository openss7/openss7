.uh Abstract
.pp
The SS7 MTP3-User Adataptation Layer (M3UA) 
.[
RFC 3332
%Z 1
.]
specifies a protocol for supporting the transport of any SS7 MTP3-User
signalling (e.g., ISUP and SCCP messages) over IP using the services of the
Stream Control Transmission Protocol.
.[
RFC 2960
%Z 1
.]
Also, provision is made for protocol elements that enable a seamless operation
of the MTP3-User peers in the SS7 and IP domains. This protocol would be used
between a Signalling Gateway (SG) and a Media Gateway Controller (MGC) or
IP-resident Database, or between two IP-based applications.  It is assumed
that the SG receives SS7 signalling over a standard SS7 interface using the
SS7 Message Transfer Part (MTP)

to provide transport.
.pp
This memo specifies M3UA Validation and Compatability tests to test M3UA
Signalling Gateway (SG) elements interacting with Application Server Process
(ASP) elements, and between IP Signalling Points (IPSP) using the M3UA
protocol.

.sh 1 "M3UA Test Environment"
.pp
Requirements for the test environment depend upon whether Validation testing
or Compatability testing is to be supported by the test environment, as
follows:
.\"
.\"
.sh 2 "Validation Testing"
.pp
The purpose of Validation Testing is to test a single implementation (SG, ASP
or IPSP) for positive and negative test cases.  Tests include generating
abnormal message sequences and patterns not normally possible with a
conforming implementation and, therefore, need to be generated by a
specialized piece of equipment called the \fIProtocol Tester\fR.  Validation
Testing validates the \fIImplementation Under Test\fR against the behvaior
required by standards specifications (in this case
.[
RFC 3332
.]
specifications).
.pp
Validation testing is normally performed on an implementation before engaging
in Compatability testing.
.pp
For M3UA validation testing, the test environment consists of the following
components:
.np
The \fIImplementation Under Test\fR (IUT).
The IUT is one M3UA SG, ASP or IPSP implementation being tested.
.\"
The SG IUT might have to offer interface capabilities in addition to the
interface capabilities required in normal operation to permit the \fISS7 MTP
Simulator\fR to inject and collect MTP primitives to and from the M3UA SG.
.\"
The ASP or IPSP IUT might have to offer interface capabilities in addition to
the interface capabilities required in normal operation to permit the \fISS7
MTP-User Simulator\fR to inject and collect MTP primitives to and from the
M3UA ASP or IPSP.
.np
The \fIProtocol Tester\fR (PT).
The PT is a specialized device that can form associations with the IUT and
pass M3UA and SCTP messages to and from the IUT in a controlled fashion as
required by the Validataion tests.
.np
The \fISS7 MTP/MTP-User Simulator\fR (SIM).
The may be part of the IUT, part of the PT or part of the test environment.
It is a specialized function that can pass MTP-User primitives to and from the
IUT.
For M3UA SG IUT validation testing, the function provides a simulation of the
MTP Level 3.
For M3UA ASP or IPSP IUT validation testing, the function provides a
simulation of the MTP Level 3 User.
.np
An \fIIP Network\fR (NET).
A network to which both the PT and IUT are attached and across which SCTP
associations can be formed.
.np
The \fIM3UA/SCCP Monitor\fR (MON).
This is a function that monitors the exchange of M3UA and SCTP messages
between the PT and IUT across the IP network.  This function might be
integrated with the PT, the IUT, or the test environment.
.\"
.\"
.sh 2 "Compatability Testing"
.pp
The purpose of Compatability Testing is to test two implementations for
compatability with each other.  Test cases typically only include positive
test cases.  Tests do not require the generation of any abnormal messages or
patterns as with Validation Testing.  Compatability Testing tests that two
implementations can perform the required functions in a compatible fashion as
dictated by the relevant standards (in this case
.[
RFC 3332
.]
specifications).
.pp
Validation testing is normally performed on an implementation before engaging
in Compatability Testing.
.pp
For M3UA Compatability testing, the test environment consists of the following
components:
.np
The \fIImplementations Under Test\fR (IUT).
The IUT consist of one SG and one ASP implementation, or two IPSP
implementations.
.\"
The SG IUT might have to offer interface capabilities in addition to the
interface capabilities required in normal operation to permit the \fISS7 MTP
Simulator\fR to inject and collect MTP primitives to and from the M3UA SG.
.\"
The ASP or IPSP IUT might have to offer interface capabilities in addition to
the interface capabilities required in normal operation to permit the \fISS7
MTP-User Simulator\fR to inject and collect MTP primitives to and from the
.np
The \fISS7 MTP/MTP-User Simulator\fR (SIM).
The may be part of the IUT, part of the PT or part of the test environment.
It is a specialized function that can pass MTP-User primitives to and from the
IUT.
For M3UA SG/ASP IUT compatability testing, the function provides a simulation
of the MTP Level 3 and a simulation of the MTP Level 3 User.  For M3UA IPSP
IUT validation testing, the function need provide only simulation of the MTP
Level 3 User at each IPSP.
.np
An \fIIP Network\fR (NET).
A network to which both the IUT are attached and across which SCTP
associations can be formed.
.np
The \fIM3UA/SCCP Monitor\fR (MON).
This is a function that monitors the exchange of M3UA and SCTP messages
between IUT across the IP network.  This function might be integrated with the
IUT, or the test environment.
.\"
.\"
.sh 2 "Test Specification"
.pp
Validation and Compatability tests are specified using the same test pattern.
Some tests are applicable to Validation testing, some are applicable to
Compatability testing, and others are applicable to both forms of testing.
For test specifications that are applicable to both Validation and
Compatability testing, one SP acts either as a PT (for Validation) or as the
second IUT (for Compatability).
.\"
.#e
.sh 1 "M3UA Test Configurations"
.pp
Test configurations for Validation and Compatability testing are specified the
same.  The only difference between Validation and Compatability testing as
applied to a specific configuration is that the SP at position \(lqA\(rq is
always the ASP IUT; at position \(lqB\(rq, is always the SG IUT.  The SP at
the other positions (\(lqC,\(rq \(lqD,\(rq etc.) are either the PT, for
Validation testing, or other IUT, for Compatability testing.
.pp
Each test case in the test suite are applicable to one configuration.
Some configurations are only applicable to SG, ASP or IPSP IUT testing.
The configurations necessary to execute the entire test suite are as follows:

The test environment for SS7 MTP Level 3
.[
q782
%Z 1
.]
testing is described in the General Aspects of SS7 Testing.
.[
q780
%Z 1
.]
There are two types of testing that are accommodated as follows:
.lp
\fBValidation Testing\fR \(em
.ix +\n(iiu
consists of validating a single Implementation Under Test (IUT).  This is
peformed by connecting the IUT to a Protocol Tester (PT) within the test
environment.
.ba +\n(iiu
.lp
Validation testing is more extensive that compatability testing.  This is
because it is possible, with the use of the Protocol Tester (PT), to generate
abnormal messages and patterns, that cannot normally be generated from an
Implementation Under Test (IUT), to test the IUT response to abormal
conditions.
.ba -\n(iiu
.lp
\fBCompatability Testing\fR \(em
.ix +\n(iiu
consists of testing the compatability of one Implementation Under Test (IUT)
with another.  This is performed by connecting the IUT together within the
test environment.
.ba +\n(iiu
.lp
Compatability testing is less extensive than validation testing.  This is
because it is not normally possible to generate abnormal test message and
patterns with an implementation that conforms to validation testing.  However,
compatability tests are better at testing the interoperability of two
implementations.
.ba -\n(iiu

.sh 1 "SS7 MTP Level 3 Test Configurations"

This section details the Validation and Compatability test configurations used

.\"
.\"
.sh 2 "Validation Test Configuration"
.pp
Validation testing consists of validating a single Implementation Under Test
(IUT) for SS7 MTP Level 3 conformance.  Several test configurations can be
used with M3UA Signalling Gateways (SG) and Application Service Processes
(ASP) as follows\*#:
.(d
.ip \*#
Note that there are no SS7 MTP Level 3 Validation or Compatability tests for
M3UA IPSP.  This is because M3UA IPSP are restricted to point-to-point
operation within the IP domain.  As such, there is no SS7 component to the
exchange between IPSPs and, thus, no SS7 MTP Level 3 test can be formulated.
