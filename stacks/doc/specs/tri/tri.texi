@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

This document specifies a @cite{STREAMS}-based
@cpindex STREAMS
kernel-level instantiation of the ITU-T Transaction Capabilities Application Part (TCAP) Transaction
(TR) Sub-Layer.  The Transaction Interface (TRI) enables the user of a transaction sub-layer service
to access and use any of a variety of conforming transaction providers without specific knowledge of
the provider's protocol.  The service interface is designed to support any transaction protocol.
This interface only specifies access to transaction sub-layer services providers, and does not
address issues concerning transaction sub-layer management, protocol performance, and performance
analysis tools.

The specification assumes that the reader is familiar with the ISO reference model terminology,
ISO/ITU-T transaction service definitions (ROSE, ACSE, TCAP), and STREAMS.

@node Model of the TRI
@section Model of the TRI

The TRI defines the services provided by the transaction sub-layer to the transaction-user at the
boundary between the Transaction Component (TC) Sub-Layer and the Transaction (TR) Sub-Layer in the
model presented in ITU-T Recommendation Q.771.  The interface consists of a set of primitives
defined as STREAMS messages that provide access to the transaction sub-layer services, and are
transferred between the TR user entity and the TR provider.  These primitives are of two types: ones
that originate from the TR user, and others that originate from the TR provider, or respond to an
event of the TR provider.  The primitives that originate from the TR provider are either
confirmations of a request or are indications to the NS user that the event has occurred.
@figref{2.1} shows the model of the TRI.

@figuresized{tri_new,2.1,Model of the TRI,4in}

The TRI allows the TR provider to be configured with any transaction sub-layer user (such as the
Transaction Component (TC) Sub-Layer) that also conforms to the TRI.  A transaction sub-layer user
can also be a user program that conforms to the TRI and accesses the TR provider via
@strong{putmsg}(2) and @strong{getmsg}(2) system calls.

@dfn{STREAMS} messages that are used to communicate transaction service primitives between the
transaction user and the transaction provider may have one of the following formats:

@enumerate

@item A @prim{M_PROTO} message block followed by zero or more @prim{M_DATA} message blocks.  The
@prim{M_PROTO} message block contains the type of service primitive and all relevant arguments
associated with the primitive.  The @prim{M_DATA} blocks contain user data associated with the
service primitive.

@item One @prim{M_PCPROTO} message block containing the type of service primitive and all the
relevant arguments associated with the primitive.

@item One or more @prim{M_DATA} message blocks containing user data.

@end enumerate

The following sections describe the service primitives which define both connection-mode and
connectionless-mode service.

For both types of service, two types of primitives exist: primitives that originate from the service
user and primitives that originate from the service provider.  The primitives that originate from
the service user make requests to the service provider or response to an event of the service
provider.  The primitive that originate from the service provider are either confirmations of a
request or are indications to the service user that an event has occurred.  The primitive types
along with the mapping of those primitives to the @dfn{STREAMS} message types and the service
primitives of the ISO/IEC xxxxx and service definitions are listed in @ref{TRI Primitives}.  The
format of these primitives and the rules governing the use of them are described in @ref{Management
Primitives}, @ref{Connection-Oriented Mode Primitives}, and @ref{Connectionless Mode Primitives}.

@node TRI Services
@section TRI Services

The features of the TRI are defined in terms of the services provided by the service provider, and
the individual primitives that may flow between the service user and the service provider.

The services supported by the TRI are based on two distinct modes of communication, connection-mode
transaction service (COTS) and connectionless transaction service (CLTS).  Also, the TRI supports
services for local management.

@subsection COTS

The main features of the connection mode communication are:

@enumerate a

@item It is virtual circuit oriented;

@item it provides transfer of data via a pre-established path; and,

@item it provides reliable data transfer.@footnote{That is, it supports TCAP

operation classes 1, 2, and 3; ROSE operation classes 1, 2, 3 and 4.}
@end enumerate

There are three phases to each instance of communication: Transaction Establishment, Data Transfer,
and Transaction Release.  Units of data arrive at the destination in the same order as they departed
their source and the data is protected against duplication or loss of data units within some
specified quality of service.

@subsection CLTS

The main features of the connectionless mode communication are:

@enumerate a

@item It is datagram oriented;

@item it provides transfer of data in self contained units;

@item there is no logical relationship between these units of data; and,

@item it is unreliable.

@end enumerate

Connectionless mode communication has no separate phases.  Each unit of data is transmitted from
source to destination independently, appropriate addressing information is included with each unit
of data.  As the units of data are transmitted independently from source to destination, there are,
in general, no guarantees of proper sequence and completeness of the data stream.

@subsection Local Management

The TRI specifications also define a set of local management functions that apply to both COTS and
CLTS modes of communication.  These services have local significance only.

Table 1 and Table 2 summarizes the TRI service primitives by their state and service.

The services defined in this section are outside the scope of the international standards.  These
services apply to both connection-mode as well as connectionless modes of communication.  They are
involved for the initialization/de-initialization of a stream connected to the TR provider.  They
are also used to manage options supported by the TR provider and to report information on the
supported parameter values.

@node Transaction Information Reporting Service
@subsection Transaction Information Reporting Service
This service provides information on the options supported by the TR provider.

@itemize 

@item @prim{TR_INFO_REQ}: This primitive request that the TR provider returns the values of all the
supported protocol parameters.  This request may be invoked during any phase.

@item @prim{TR_INFO_ACK}: This primitive is in response to the @dfn{TR_INFO_REQ} primitive and
returns the values of the supported protocol parameters to the TR user.

@end itemize 

The sequence of primitives for transaction information management is shown in @figref{3.1}.

@figuresized{tri_new1,3.1,Sequence of Primitives -- Transaction Information Reporting Service,3.5in}

@node TR User Bind Service
@subsection TR User Bind Service

This service allows an originating address to be associated with a stream.  It allows the TR user to
negotiate the number of transaction begin indications that can remain unacknowledged for that TR
user (a transaction begin indication is considered unacknowledged while it is awaiting a
corresponding transaction response or abort request from the TR user).  This service also defines a
mechanism that allows a stream (bound to the address of the TR user) to be reserved to handle
incoming transactions only.  This stream is referred to as the listener stream.

@itemize 

@item @prim{TR_BIND_REQ}: This primitive request that the TR user be bound to a particular
originating address, and negotiate the number of allowable outstanding transaction indications for
that address.

@item @prim{TR_BIND_ACK}: This primitive is in response to the @prim{TR_BIND_REQ} primitive and
indicates to the user that the specified TR user has been bound to a protocol address.

@end itemize 

The sequence of primitives for the TR user bind service is shown in @figref{3.2}.

@figuresized{tri_new2,3.2,Sequence of Primitives -- TR User Bind Service,3.5in}

@node TR User Unbind Service
@subsection TR User Unbind Service

This service allows the TR user to be unbound from a protocol address.

@itemize 

@item @prim{TR_UNBIND_REQ}: This primitive requests that the TR user be unbound from the protocol
address it had previously been bound to.

@end itemize 

The sequence of primitives for the TR user unbind service is shown in @figref{3.3}.

primitive was received successfully by the TR provider.

@end itemize 

An example showing the sequence of primitives for successful receive acknowledgement is depicted in
@figref{3.3}.

@node Options Mangement Service
@subsection Options Mangement Service

This service allows the TR user to manage the QOS parameter values associated with the TR provider.

@itemize 

@item @prim{TR_OPTMGMT_REQ}: This primitive allows the TR user to select default values for QOS
parameters within the range supported by the TR provider, and to indicate the default selection of
return option.

This section describes the required transaction service primitives that define the connection mode
interface.

The queue model for connection-oriented services are discussed in more detail in ITU-T X.217 and
ITU-T Q.771.

The queue model represents the operation of a transaction association in the abstract by a pair of
queues linking two transaction users.  There is one queue for each direction of data flow.  Each
queue represents a flow control function in one direction of transfer.  The ability of a user to add
objects to a queue will be determined by the behaviour of the user removing objects from that queue,
and the state of the queue.  The pair of queues is considered to be available for each potential
transaction association.  Objects that are entered or removed from the queue are either as a result
of interactions at the two transaction addresses, or as the result of TR provider initiatives.

@itemize 

@item A queue is empty until a transaction object has been entered and can be returned to this
state, with loss of its contents, by the TR provider.

@item Objects may be entered into a queue as a result of the actions of the source TR user, subject
to control by the TR provider.

@item Objects may also be entered into a queue by the TR provider.

@item Objects are removed from the queue under the control of the TR user in the same order as they
were entered except:

@enumerate 

@item If the object is of type defined to be able to advance ahead of the preceding object (however,
no object is defined to be able to advance ahead of another object of the same type), or

@item If the following object is defined to be destructive with respect to the preceding object on
the queue.  If necessary, the last object on the queue will be deleted to allow a destructive object
to be entered - they will therefore always be added to the queue.  For example, ``abort'' objects
are defined to be destructive with respect to all other objects.

@node Transaction Initiation Phase
@subsection Transaction Initiation Phase

A pair of queues is associated with a transaction association between two transaction users when the
TR provider receives a @prim{TR_BEGIN_REQ} primitive at one of the TR users resulting in a begin
object being entered into the queue.  The queues will remain associated with the transaction until a
@prim{TR_END_REQ} or @prim{TR_ABORT_REQ} primitive (resulting in an end or abort object) is either
entered or removed from a queue.  Similarly, in the queue from the destination TR user, objects can
be entered into the queue only after the begin object associated with the @prim{TR_BEGIN_RES} has
been entered into the queue.  Alternatively, the destination TR user can enter an end or abort
object into the queue instead of the begin object to terminate the transaction.

The transaction establishment procedure will fail if the TR provider is unable to establish a
transaction association, or if the destination TR user is unable to accept the @prim{TR_BEGIN_IND}
(see Transaction Termination primitive definition in @ref{TR_END_IND}).

@subsubsection User Primitives Successful Transaction Establishment

The following user primitives support COTS Phase I (Transaction Establishment)
services:

@itemize 

@item @prim{TR_BEGIN_REQ}: This primitive requests that the TR provider form a transaction
association with the specified destination TR user.

@item @prim{TR_BEGIN_RES}: This primitive requests that the TR provider accept a previous
transaction indication.

@end itemize 

@subsubsection Provider Primitives Successful Transaction Establishment

The following provider primitives support COTS Phase I (Transaction Establishment) services:

@itemize 

@item @prim{TR_BEGIN_IND}: This primitive indicates to the TR user that a transaction association
request has been made by a user at the specified source address.

@item @prim{TR_BEGIN_CON}: This primitive indicates to the TR user that a transaction initiation
request has been confirmed on the specified responding address.

@end itemize 

The sequence of primitives in a successful transaction initiation is defined by the time sequence
diagrams as shown in @figref{3.6}.

@figuresized{tri_new6,3.6,Sequence of Primitives -- Successful Transaction Initiation,3.5in}

The sequence of primitives for the transaction initiation response token value determination is
shown in @figref{3.7} (procedures for transaction initiation response token value determination are
discussed in @ref{TR_BIND_REQ}, and @ref{TR_BIND_ACK}).

@figuresized{tri_new7,3.7,Sequence of Primitives -- Transaction Response Token Value Determination,3.5in}

@node Transaction Data Transfer Phase
@subsection Transaction Data Transfer Phase

Flow control on the transaction association is done by management of the queue capacity, and by
allowing objects of certain types to be inserted to the queues, as shown in @emph{Table 4}.

@subsubsection Primitives for Data Transfer

The following primitives support COTS Phase II (Transaction Data Transfer) services:

@itemize 

@item @prim{TR_CONT_REQ}: This primitive requests that the TR provider transfer the specified user
data.

@item @prim{TR_CONT_IND}: This primitive indicates to the TR user that this message contains user
data.

@end itemize 

@figref{3.8} shows the sequence of primitives for successful user data transfer.  The sequence of
primitives may remain incomplete if a @prim{TR_END_REQ}, @prim{TR_END_IND}, @prim{TR_ABORT_REQ}, or
@prim{TR_ABORT_IND} primitive occurs.

@figuresized{tri_new8,3.8,Sequence of Primitives -- Data Transfer,3.5in}

@node Transaction Termination Phase
@subsection Transaction Termination Phase

The transaction association procedure is initialized by insertion of an end or abort object
(associated with a @prim{TR_END_REQ} or @prim{TR_ABORT_REQ}) into the queue.  As shown in Table?,
the termination procedure is destructive with respect to other objects in the queue, and eventually
results in the emptying of queues and termination of the transaction association.

The sequence of primitives depends on the origin of the termination action.  The sequence may be:

@enumerate 

@item invoked by on TR user, with a request from that TR user leading to an indication to the other;

@item invoked by both TR users, with a request from each of the TR users;

@item invoked by the TR provider, with an indication to each of the TR users;

@item invoked independently by one TR user and the TR provider, with a request from the originating
TR user and an indication to the other.

@end enumerate 

@subsubsection Primitives for Transaction Termination

The following primitives support CONS Phase III (Transaction Termination) services:

@itemize 

@item @prim{TR_END_REQ}: This primitive requests that the TR provider deny an outstanding request
for a transaction association or normal termination of an existing transaction.

@item @prim{TR_ABORT_REQ}: This primitive requests that the TR provider deny an outstanding request
for a transaction association or abnormal termination of an existing transaction.

@item @prim{TR_END_IND}: This primitive indicates to the TR user that either a request for
transaction initiation has been denied or an existing transaction has been terminated normally.

@item @prim{TR_ABORT_IND}: This primitive indicates to the TR user that either a request for
transaction initiation has been denied or an existing transaction has been terminated abnormally.

@end itemize 

The sequence of primitives are shown in the time sequence diagrams in the figures that follow:

@figuresized{tri_new9,3.9,Sequence of Primitives -- TR User Invoked Termination,3.5in}

@figuresized{tri_ne10,3.10,Sequence of Primitives -- Simultaneous TR User Invoked Termination,3.5in}

@figuresized{tri_ne12,3.12,Sequence of Primitives -- Simultaneous TR User and Provider Invoked Termination,3.5in}

A TR user may reject a transaction initiation attempt by issuing a @prim{TR_ABORT_REQ}.  The
originator parameter in the @prim{TR_ABORT_REQ} will indicate TR user invoked termination.  The
sequence of primitives is shown in @figref{3.13}.

@figuresized{tri_ne13,3.13,Sequence of Primitives -- TR User Rejection of a Transaction Initiation Attempt,3.5in}

If the TR provider is unable to establish a transaction, it indicates this to the requester by an
@prim{TR_ABORT_IND}.  The originator of the primitive indicates a TR provider invoked release.  This
is shown in @figref{3.14}.

@menu
* Request and Response Primitives::
@end menu

The connectionless mode service allows for the transfer of transaction user data in one and both
directions simultaneously without establishing a transaction dialogue.  A set of primitives are
defined that carry transaction user data and control information between the TR user and the TR
provider entities.  The primitives are modelled as requests initiated by the TR user and indications
initiated by the TR provider.  Indications may be initiated by the TR provider independently from
requests by the TR user.

The connectionless mode service consists of one phase.

@node Request and Response Primitives
@subsection Request and Response Primitives

@itemize 

@item @prim{TR_UNI_REQ}: This primitive requests that the TR provider send the transaction user data
to the specified destination.

@subsubsection Transaction Bind Request

@subsubheading @prim{TR_BIND_REQ}

This primitive requests that the TR provider bind a protocol address to the @dfn{stream}, negotiate
the number of dialogue indications allowed to be outstanding by the TR provider for the specified
protocol address, and activate@footnote{A @dfn{stream} is viewed as active when the transaction
provider may receive and transmit APDUs (ACSE protocol data units) associated with the
@dfn{stream}.} the @dfn{stream} associated with the protocol address.

@subsubheading Format

The format of the message is one @prim{M_PROTO} message block.  The format of the @prim{M_PROTO}
message block is as follows:@footnote{The format of the @prim{TR_BIND_REQ} primitive is chosen to be
as consistent as possible with the equivalent TPI and NPI primitives.}

@display

    ulong BIND_flags;         /* bind flags */
} TR_bind_req_t;
@end verbatim
@tpindex TR_bind_req_t
@end display

@subsubheading Parameters

The primitive has the following arguments:

@table @parm

@item PRIM_type
Specifies the primitive type.  Always @prim{TR_BIND_REQ}.

@item ADDR_length
Specifies the length@footnote{All lengths, offsets and sizes in all structures refer to the number
of octets.} of the protocol address to be bound to the @dfn{stream}.

@item ADDR_offset
Specifies the offset from the beginning of the @prim{M_PROTO} message block where the protocol
address begins.  The proper alignment of the address in the @prim{M_PROTO} message block is not
guaranteed.  The address in the @prim{M_PROTO} message block is, however, aligned the same as it was
received from the TR user.

@item XACT_number
@footnote{This field should be ignored by TR providers providing only a unidirectional (TCAP
operation class 4, ROSE operation class 5) service.}The requested number of dialogue begin
indications@footnote{If the number of outstanding ``begin'' indications equals @parm{XACT_number},
the TR provider need not discard further incoming ``begin'' indications, but may choose to queue
them internally until the number of outstanding ``begin'' indications dropts below
@parm{XACT_number}.} allowed to be outstanding by the TR provider for the specified protocol
address.  Only one stream per protocol address is allowed to have a @parm{XACT_number} greater than
zero.  This indicates to the TR provider that the @dfn{stream} is a @dfn{listener stream} for the TR
user.  This @dfn{stream} will be used by the TR provider for dialogue ``begin'' indications for that
protocol address, @pxref{TR_BEGIN_IND}.

@item BIND_flags

@subsubheading Originator

This primitive is issued by the TR provider.

@subsubheading Valid State

@psta{TRS_WACK_BREQ}.

@subsubheading New State

On success, the new state is @psta{TRS_IDLE}; on error, @psta{TRS_UNBND}.

@subsubheading Rules

The following rules apply to the binding of the specified protocol address to the @dfn{stream}:

@itemize ---

@item If the @parm{ADDR_length} field in the @prim{TR_BIND_REQ} primitive is zero (0), then the TR
provider must assign a protocol address to the user.

@item The TR provider is to bind the protocol address as specified in the @prim{TR_BIND_REQ}
primitive.  If the requested protocol address is in use or if the TR provider cannot bind the
specified address, it must return an error.

@end itemize

The following rules apply to negotiating the @parm{XACT_number} argument:

@itemize ---

@item The returned value must be less than or equal to the corresponding requested number as
indicated in the @prim{TR_BIND_REQ} primitive.

@item If the requested value is greater than zero, the returned value must also be greater than
zero.

@item Only one @dfn{stream} that is bound to the indicated protocol address any have a negotiated
accepted number of maximum transaction requests greater than zero.  If a @prim{TR_BIND_REQ}
primitive specifies a value greater than zero, but another @dfn{stream} has already bound itself to
the given protocol address with a value greater than zero, the TR provider must return an error.

@item If a @dfn{stream} with @parm{XACT_number} greater than zero is used to accept a dialogue
(without specifying a @parm{TRANS_id}), the @dfn{stream} will be found busy during the duration of
that connection and no other @dfn{streams} may be bound to that protocol address with a
@parm{XACT_number} greater than zero.  This will prevent more than one @dfn{stream} bound to the
identical protocol address from accepting dialogue indications.  See also @ref{TR_BEGIN_RES}.

@item A @dfn{stream} requesting a @parm{XACT_number} of zero should always be legal.  This indicates
to the TR provider that the @dfn{stream} is to be used to request dialogues only.

@item @ @dfn{stream} with a negotiated @parm{XACT_number} greater than zero may generate dialogue
requests (@pxref{TR_BEGIN_REQ},) or accept dialogue indications (@pxref{TR_BEGIN_RES}.)

@end itemize

If the above rules result in an error condition, then the TR provider must issue a
@prim{TR_ERROR_ACK} primitive to the TR user specifying the error as defined in the description of
the @prim{TR_BIND_REQ} primitive, @ref{TR_BIND_REQ}.


@page
@node TR_UNBIND_REQ
@subsubsection Transaction Unbind Request

@end itemize

@subsubheading Acknowledgements

This primitive requires the transaction provider to generate one of the following acknowledgements
upon receipt of the primitive:

@itemize ---

@item @emph{Successful Association Establishment:} This is indicated with the @prim{TR_BEGIN_CON}
primitive described in @ref{TR_BEGIN_REQ}.  This results in the @psta{TRS_DATA_XFER} state for the
transaction.  Successful establishment and tear down can also be indicated with the
@prim{TR_END_IND} primitive described in @ref{TR_END_IND}.  This results in the @psta{TRS_IDLE}
state for the transaction.

@item @emph{Unsuccessful Association Establishment:} This is indicated with the @prim{TR_ABORT_IND}
primitive described in @ref{TR_ABORT_IND}.  For example, an association may be rejected because
either the called transaction user cannot be reached, or the transaction provider or the called
transaction user did not agree on the specified options.  This results in the @psta{TRS_IDLE} state
for the transaction.

@item @emph{Non-fatal errors:} These are indicated with the @prim{TR_ERROR_ACK} primitive.  The
applicable non-fatal errors are defined as follows:

@table @perr

@item TRACCES
This indicates that the user did not have proper permissions for the use of the requested protocol
address or protocol options.

@item TRBADADDR
This indicates that the protocol address was in an incorrect format or the address contained illegal
information.  It is not intended to indicate protocol connection errors, such as an unreachable
destination.  Those types of errors are indicated with the @prim{TR_ABORT_IND} primitive described
in @ref{TR_ABORT_IND}.

@item TRBADOPT
This indicates that the options were in an incorrect format or they contained illegal information.

@item TROUTSTATE
The primitive would place the transaction interface out of state.

@item TRBADDATA
The amount of user data specified was illegal (@pxref{TR_INFO_ACK}).

@item TRSYSERR
A system error has occured and the UNIX System error is indicated in the primitive.

@table @pval

@item TR_NO_PERMISSION
The value of this flag  may indicate either that the transaction peer gives permission (clear) to
end the transaction association or refuses permission (set) to end the transaction association.
This flag is only valid for transaction providers that support it (@pxref{Addendum for ANSI

@end table

@subsubheading Valid State

This primitive is valid in state @psta{TRS_IDLE}.  This primitive is only valid in
connection-oriented mode.

@subsubheading New State

The new state for the identified transaction is @psta{TRS_WRES_CIND}.

@subsubheading Rules

The following rules apply to the issuance of this primitive by the transaction provider:

@itemize ---

@item The transaction identifier provided by the transaction provider uniquely identifies this
transaction begin indication within the stream upon which the primitive is issued.  This must be a
positive, non-zero value.  The high bit of the transaction identifier is reserved for exclusive use
by the transaction user in generating correlation identifiers.

@item It is not necessary to indicate a destination address in @parm{DEST_length}, and
@parm{DEST_offset} when the protocol address to which the begin indication corresponds is the same
as the local protocol address to which the listening stream is bound.  In the case that the
destination protocol address is not provided, @parm{DEST_length} and @parm{DEST_offset} must both be
set to zero (0).  When the local protocol address to which the begin indication corresponds is not
the same as the bound address for the stream, the transaction provider must indicate the destination
protocol address using @parm{DEST_length} and @parm{DEST_offset}.

@item The origination protocol address is a mandatory field.  The transaction provider must indicate
the originating protocol address corresponding to the begin indication using the @parm{ORIG_length}
and @parm{ORIG_offset} fields.

@item Any indicated options are included in the @parm{OPT_length} and @parm{OPT_offset} fields.

@item When the @prim{TR_NO_PERMISSION} flag is set, the transaction user must not issue a
@prim{TR_END_REQ} primitive in response to this indication.

not guaranteed.

@subsubheading Flags

The following association flags are defined:

@table @pval

@item TR_NO_PERMISSION
The value of this flag may indicate either that the transaction peer gives permission (clear) to end
the transaction association or refuses permission (set) to end the transaction association.  This

@end table

@subsubheading Mode

This primitive is only valid in connection-oriented mode.

@subsubheading Originator

Transaction provider.

@subsubheading Valid State

This primitive is valid in transaction state @psta{TRS_WCON_CREQ}.

@subsubheading New State

The new state for the transaction is @psta{TRS_DATA_XFER}.

@subsubheading Rules

The following rules apply to the issuance of this primitive:

@itemize ---

@item It is not always necessary for the transport provider to provide the responding address in the
@parm{ORIG_length} and @parm{ORIG_offiset} fields.  Where the responding protocol address is the
same as the destination protocol address for which the transaction initialization was requested, it
is not necessary to provide the responding address in the @dfn{TR_BEGIN_CON}.  Where the responding
protocol address is not provided, the @parm{ORIG_length} and @parm{ORIG_offset} fields are set to
zero (0).

@item When the @prim{TR_NO_PERMISSION} flag is set, the transaction user must not issue a
@prim{TR_END_REQ} primitive in response to this indication.

@end itemize

@page
@node Transaction Data Transfer
@subsection Transaction Data Transfer

@menu
* TR_CONT_REQ::
* TR_CONT_IND::
@end menu

The data transfer service primitives provide for an exchange of transaction user data known as
TSDUs, in either direction or in both directions simultaneously on a transaction association.  The
transaction service preserves both the sequence and the boundaries of the TSDUs.

@node TR_CONT_REQ
@subsubsection Transaction Continue Request

@subsubheading @prim{TR_CONT_REQ}

This user-originated primitive specifies to the transaction provider that this message contains
transaction user data.  It allows the transfer of transaction user data between transaction users,
without modification by the transaction provider.

The transaction user must send an integral number of octets of data greater than zero.  In a case
where the size of the TSDU exceeds the TIDU (as specified by the size of the @parm{TIDU_size}
parameter of the @prim{TR_INFO_ACK} primitive described in @ref{TR_INFO_ACK}), the TSDU may be
broken up into more than one TIDU.  When a TSDU is broken up into more than one TIDU, the
@pval{T_MORE} flag will be set on each TIDU except the last one.

@subsubheading Format

The format of the message is one or more @prim{M_DATA} message blocks.  Use of a @prim{M_PROTO}
message block is optional.  The @prim{M_PROTO} message block is used for two reasons:

@enumerate a

@item to indicate that the TSDU is broken into more than one TIDU, and that the data carried in the
following @prim{M_DATA} message block constitutes one TIDU;

@item to indicate whether receipt confirmation is desired for the TSDU.

@end enumerate

message block, followed by zero or more @prim{M_DATA} message blocks containing user data for the
association, structured as follows:

@display
@verbatim
typedef struct TR_cont_req {
    ulong PRIM_type;          /* Always TR_CONT_REQ */
    ulong TRANS_id;           /* Transaction id */
    ulong ASSOC_flags;        /* Association flags */
    ulong OPT_length;         /* Options structure length */
    ulong OPT_offset;         /* Options structure offset */
} TR_cont_req_t;
@end verbatim
@tpindex TR_cont_req_t
@end display

@subsubheading Guidelines for use of @t{M_PROTO}

The following guidelines must be followed with respect to the user of the @prim{M_PROTO} message
block:

@enumerate

@item The @t{M_PROTO} message block need not be present when the TSDU size is less that or equal to
the TIDU size and one of the following is true:

@itemize ---

@item receipt confirmation has been negotiated for non-use; or

@item receipt confirmation has been successfully negotiated for use or non-use and the default
selection as specified via the @prim{TR_OPTMGMT_REQ} primitive is to be used.

@end itemize

@item The @t{M_PROTO} message block must be present when:

@itemize ---

@item the TSDU size is greater than the TIDU size;

@item receipt confirmation has been successfully negotiated for use and the default selection as
specified with the @prim{TR_OPTMGMT_REQ} primitive needs to be overridden.

@end itemize

@end enumerate

@subsubheading Parameters

The primitive has the following arguments:

@table @parm

@item PRIM_type
Specifies the primitive type: always @prim{TR_CONT_REQ}.

@item TRANS_id
Specifies the transaction identifier previously indicated by the transport provider to uniquely
identify the transaction.  The transaction identifier must be specified by the transaction user
unless there is only one transaction supported by the stream in transaction state
@psta{TRS_DATA_XFER}.  When specified, the transaction identifier must be the same as the
transaction identifier that was indicated by the transaction provider in the corresponding
@prim{TR_BEGIN_IND} or @prim{TR_BEGIN_CON}.

@item ASSOC_flags
Specifies the option flags provided with the primitive.  See ``Flags'' below.  Some flags may be
provider specific.

@item OPT_length
Specifies the length of the protocol options associated with the user data transfer.  Supplying
protocol options with the primitive is optional.  If the transaction user does not provide protocol
options with the primitive, the @parm{OPT_length} and @parm{OPT_offset} fields must be set to zero
(0) by the transaction user.  The format of the protocol options are provider specific.

@item OPT_offset
Specifies the offset from the beginning of the @prim{M_PROTO} message block where the protocol
options begin.  Alignment of the protocol options in the @prim{M_PROTO} message block is not
guaranteed.  However, the alignment of the protocol options in the @prim{M_PROTO} message block are
the same as was specified by the transport user.

@end table

@subsubheading Flags

@table @pval

@item TR_MORE_DATA_FLAG
When set, the @pval{MORE_DATA_FLAG} indicates that the next @prim{TR_CONT_REQ} primitive (TIDU) is
also part of this TSDU.

@item TR_RC_FLAG
By setting this flag on the @prim{TR_CONT_REQ}, the originating transaction user can request
confirmation of receipt of the @prim{TR_CONT_REQ} primitive.

@item TR_SEQ_ASSURANCE
By setting this flag on the primitive, the originating transaction user can indicate that ``sequence
assured'' service is requested from the underlying network service provider.

@item TR_NO_PERMISSION
By setting this flag on the @prim{TR_CONT_REQ}, the originating transaction user can either deny
(set) or grant (clear) permission for the transaction peer to terminate the transaction association
upon receipt of the corresponding @prim{TR_CONT_IND} primitive.  This flag is only used for
transaction providers that support this feature (@pxref{Addendum for ANSI Conformance}).

@end table

@subsubheading Valid State

This primitive is valid in transaction state @psta{TRS_DATA_XFER}.  This primitive is only valid in
connection-oriented mode.

@subsubheading New State

The new state for the transaction remains unchanged.

@subsubheading Acknowledgements

This primitive does not require acknowledgement.  If a non-fatal error occurs, it is the
responsibility of the peer ASE to report it within the upper-layer protocol or using the
@prim{TR_ABORT_IND} primitive (@pxref{TR_ABORT_IND}).  Fatal errors are indicated with the
@prim{M_ERROR} message type which results in the failure of all operating system service routines on
the @dfn{stream}.  The allowable fatal errors are as follows:

@table @perr

@item EPROTO
This error indicates on of the following unrecoverable protocol conditions:

@itemize ---

@item The transaction interface was found to be in an incorrect state.

@item The amount of transaction user data associated with the primitive is outside the range
supported by the transaction provider (as specified by the @parm{TIDU_size} parameter of the
@prim{TR_INFO_ACK} primitive described in @ref{TR_INFO_ACK}.)

@item The options requested are either not support by the transaction provider or their use is not
specified with the @prim{TR_BEGIN_REQ} primitive.

@item The @prim{M_PROTO} message block was not follows by one or more @prim{M_DATA} message blocks.

@item The amount of transaction user data associated with the current NSDU is outside the range
supported by the transaction provider (as specified by the @parm{TSDU_size} parameter in the
@prim{TR_INFO_ACK} primitive described in @ref{TR_INFO_ACK}.)

@item The @pval{TR_RC_FLAG} and @pval{TR_MORE_DATA_FLAG} were both set in the primitive, or the
flags field contained an unknown value.

@end itemize

@end table

@b{NOTE:} If the interface is in the @psta{TRS_IDLE} state when the provider receives the
@prim{TR_CONT_REQ} primitive, then the transaction provider should discard the request without
generating a fatal error.

@page
@node TR_CONT_IND
@subsubsection Transaction Continue Indication

@subsubheading @prim{TR_CONT_IND}

This transaction provider originated primitive indicates to the transaction user that this message
contains transaction user data.  As in the @prim{TR_CONT_REQ} primitive (@pxref{TR_CONT_REQ}), the
TSDU can eb segmented into more than one TIDU.  The TIDUs are assocated with the TSDU by using the
@pval{TR_MORE_DATA_FLAG}.  The @pval{TR_RC_FLAG} and @pval{TR_NO_PERMISSION} flags are allowed to be
set only on the last TIDU.  Use of the @prim{M_PROTO} message blocks is optional (see guidelines
describe in @pxref{TR_CONT_REQ}).

@subsubheading Parameters

The primitive has the following arguments:

@table @parm

@item PRIM_type
Indicates the primitive type: always @prim{TR_ABORT_IND}.

@item CORR_id
Indicates the correlation identifier previously specified by the transport user to uniquely identify
an outstanding transaction request that has not yet received transaction confirmation.  For all
other cases, this field must be set to zero (0).

@item TRANS_id
Indicates the transaction identifier previously indicated by the transport provider to uniquely
identify the transaction.  The transaction identifier must be indicated by the transaction provider.
The transaction identifier must be the same as the transaction identifier that was indicated in the
corresponding @prim{TR_BEGIN_IND} or @prim{TR_BEGIN_CON} primitive (if any).

@item OPT_length
Indicates the length of the protocol options associated with the transaction association
termination.  Protocol options are only indicated by the transaction provider when they were
supplied by the underlying protocol.  If the transport provider does not indicate protocol options,
the @parm{OPT_length} and @parm{OPT_offset} fields must be set to zero (0).  The format of the
protocol options are provider specific.

@item OPT_offset
Indicates the offset from the beginning of the @prim{M_PROTO} message block where the protocol
options begin.

@item ABORT_cause
Indicates the cause of the abort.  Abort causes are provider specific.

@item ORIGINATOR
Indicates the originator of the abort.  This field can have values @pval{TR_USER} or
@pval{TR_PROVIDER} or @pval{TR_UNSPECIFIED}.

@node Diagnostics Requirements
@chapter Diagnostics Requirements

@menu
* Non-Fatal Errors::
* Fatal Errors::
@end menu

There are two error handling facilities available to the TR user: one to handle non-fatal errors and
one to handle fatal errors.

@node Non-Fatal Errors
@section Non-Fatal Errors

The non-fatal errors are those that a TR user can correct, and are reported in the form of an error
acknowledgement to the appropriate primitive in error.  Only those primitive which require
acknowledgements may generate a non-fatal error acknowledgement.  These acknowledgements always
report syntactical error in the specified primitive when the TR provider receives the primitive.
The primitive descriptions@footnote{@xref{TRI Primitives}.} define those primitive and rules
regarding acknowledgement for each primitive.  These errors are reported to the TR user with the
@prim{TR_ERROR_ACK} primitive, (@pxref{TR_ERROR_ACK}), and give the TR user the option of reissuing
the TR service primitive that cause the error.  The @prim{TR_ERROR_ACK} primitive also indicates to
the TR user that no action was taken by the TR provider upon receipt of the primitive which cause
the error.

These errors do not change the state of the TR service interface as seen by the TR user.  The state
of the interface after the issuance of a @prim{TR_ERROR_ACK} primitive should be the same as it was
before the TR provider receive the interface primitive that was in error.

The allowable errors that can be reported on the receipt of a TR initiated primitive are presented
in the description of the appropriate primitives, see @ref{TRI Primitives}.

@node Fatal Errors
@section Fatal Errors

Fatal errors are those that cannot be corrected by the TR user, or those errors that result in an
uncorrectable error in the interface or in the TR provider.

The most common of these errors are listed under the appropriate primitives (@pxref{TRI
Primitives}).  The transaction provider should issue fatal errors only if the transaction user
cannot correct the condition that caused the error or if the transaction provider has no means of
reporting a transaction user correctable error.  If the transaction provider detects an
uncorrectable non-protocol error internal to the transaction provider, the provider should issue a
fatal error to the user.

Fatal errors are indicated to the transaction user with the @dfn{STREAMS} message type
@prim{M_ERROR} with the UNIX System error @perr{EPROTO}.  This is the only type of error that the
transaction provider should use to indicate a fatal protocol error to the transaction user.  The
message @prim{M_ERROR} will result in the failure of all the operating system service routines on
the @dfn{stream}.  The only way for the user to recover from a fatal error is to ensure that all
processes close the file associated with the @dfn{stream}.  Then the user may reopen the file
associated with the @dfn{stream}.

@c Two error handling facilities should be provided to the TR service user: one to handle non-fatal errors, and the other
@c to handle fatal errors.
@c @section Non-Fatal Error Handling Facility
@c These are errors that do not change the state of the TR service interface as seen by the TR service user and provide
@c the user with the option of reissuing the TR primitive with the corrected options specification.  The non-fatal error
@c handling is provided only to those primitives that require acknowledgements, and uses the @prim{TR_ERROR_ACK} to report
@c these errors.  These errors retain the state of the TR service interface the same as it was before the TR provider
@c received the primitive that was in error.  Syntax errors and rule violations are reported via the non-fatal error
@c handling facility.
@c @section Fatal Error Handling Facility
@c These errors are issued by the TR provider when it detects errors that are not correctable by the TR user, or if it is
@c unable to report a correctable error to the TR service user.  Fatal errors are indicated via the STREAMS message type
@c @prim{M_ERROR} with the UNIX system error @perr{EPROTO}.  The @prim{M_ERROR} STREAMS message type will result in the
@c failure of all the UNIX system calls on the stream.  The TR service user can recover from a fatal error by having all
@c the processes close the files associated with the stream, and then reopening them for processing.

@node Transaction Service Interface Sequence of Primitives
@chapter Transaction Service Interface Sequence of Primitives

The allowable sequence of primitives are described in the state diagrams and tables for both the
connection-oriented and connectionless mode mode transaction services described in @ref{State/Event
Tables}.

@section Rules for State Maintenance

@subsection General Rules for State Maintenace

The following are rules regarding the maintenance of the state of the interface:

@itemize @bullet

@item It is the responsibility of the transaction provider to keep record of the state of the
interface as viewed by the transaction user.

@item The transaction provider must never issue a primitive that places the interface out of state.

@item The uninitialized state of a @dfn{stream} is the initial and final state, and it must be bound
(@pxref{TR_BIND_REQ}) before the transaction provider may view it as an active @dfn{stream}.

@item If the transaction provider sends a @prim{M_ERROR} upstream, it should also drop any further
messages received on its write side of the @dfn{stream}.

@end itemize

@subsection Connection-Oriented Transaction Service Rules for State Maintenace

The following rules apply only to the connection-oriented mode transaction services:

@itemize @bullet

@item A transaction association end procedure can be initiated at any time during the transaction
association establishment or user data transfer phases.

@item The state tables for the connection-oriented mode transaction service providers include the
management of the correlation and transaction identifiers when a transaction provider sends multiple
@prim{TR_BEGIN_IND} indications or accepts multiple @prim{TR_BEGIN_REQ} requests without waiting for
the response or confirmation to the previous indication or request.  It is the responsibility of the
transaction provider not to change state until all the indications or requests have been responded
to or confirmed, therefore the provider should remain in the @psta{TRS_WRES_CIND} or
@psta{TRS_WACK_CREQ} state while there are any outstanding begin indications or requests pending
response or confirmation.  The provider should change state appropriately when all the begin
indications or requests have been responded to or confirmed.

@item The only time the state of the transaction service interface of a @dfn{stream} may be
transferred to another @dfn{stream} is when it is indicated in a @prim{TR_BEGIN_RES} primitive.  The
following rules then apply to the cooperating @dfn{streams}:

@itemize ---

@item The @dfn{stream} that is to accept the current state of the interface must be bound to an
appropriate protocol address and must be in the idle state.@footnote{This is not really true for
either TRI or TPI.  The accepting stream can be bound or unbound, and for some protocols may be
bound to an address different or the same as the stream upon which the begin indication was issued.}

@item The user transferring the current state of a @dfn{stream} must have the correct permissions
for the use of the protocol address bound to the accepting @dfn{stream}.

@item  The @dfn{stream} which transfers the state of the transaction interface must be placed into
an appropriate state after the completion of the transfer.

@end itemize

@end itemize

@section Rules for Precedence of Primitives on a @dfn{Stream}

@subsection General Rules for Precedence of Primitives

The following rules apply to the precedence of transaction interface primitives with respect to
their position on a @dfn{stream}:@footnote{The @dfn{stream} queue which contains a transaction user
initiated primitives is referred to as the @dfn{stream} write queue.  The @dfn{stream} queue which
contains the transaction provider initiated primitives is referred to as the @dfn{stream} read
queue.}

@itemize @bullet

@item The transaction provider has responsibility for determining precedence of its @dfn{stream}
write queue, as per the rules defined in @ref{Primitive Precedence Tables}.  The appendix specifies
the rules for precedence for both the connection-oriented and connectionless transaction services.

@item The transaction user has the responsibility for determining precedence on its @dfn{stream}
read queue, as per the rules defined in @ref{Primitive Precedence Tables}.

@item All primitives on the @dfn{stream} are assumed to be placed on the queue in the correct
sequence as defined above.

@end itemize

@subsection Connection-Oriented Transaction Service Rules for Precedence of Primitives

The following rules apply only to the connection-oriented transaction services:

@itemize @bullet

@item There is no guarantee of delivery of user data once a @prim{TR_ABORT_REQ} primitive has been
issued.

@end itemize

@section Rules for Flushing Queues

@subsection General Rules for Flushing Queues

The following rules pertain to flushing of @dfn{stream} queues: (No other flushes should be needed
to keep the queues in the proper condition.)

@itemize @bullet

@item The transaction providers must be aware that they will receive @prim{M_FLUSH} message from
upstream.  These flush requests are issued to ensure that the providers receive certain messages and
primitives.  It is the responsibility of the providers to act appropriately as deemed necessary by
the providers.

@item The transaction provider must send up a @prim{M_FLUSH} message to flush both the read and
write queues after receiving a successful @prim{TR_UNBIND_REQ} message and prior to issuing the
@prim{TR_OK_ACK} primitive.

@end itemize

@subsection Connection-Oriented Transaction Service Rules for Flushing Queues

The following rules apply only to the connection-oriented transaction services:

@itemize @bullet

@item If the interface is in the @psta{TRS_DATA_XFER}, @psta{TRS_WIND_ORDREL} or
@psta{TRS_WACK_ORDREL} state, the transaction provider must send up a @prim{M_FLUSH} message to
flush both the read and write queues before sending up a @prim{TR_ABORT_IND}.

@item If the interface is in the @psta{TRS_DATA_XFER}, @psta{TRS_WIND_ORDREL} or
@psta{TRS_WACK_ORDREL} state, the transaction provider must send up a @prim{M_FLUSH} message to
flush both the read and write queues after receiving a successful @prim{TR_ABORT_REQ} primitive and
before issuing the @prim{TR_OK_ACK} primitive.

@end itemize


@node Addendum for ITU-T Conformance
@unnumbered Addendum for ITU-T Conformance

This section describes the formats and rules that are specified to ITU-T Q.771 operation.  The
addendum must be used along with the generic TRI as defined in the main document when implementing a
TR provider that will be configured with the ITU-T Q.771 (TCAP) Transaction Sub-Layer.

@section Quality of Service: Model and Description

The ``Quality of Service'' characteristics apply to both connection-oriented and connectionless
transaction services.

@subsection QoS Overview

QoS (Quality of Service) is described in terms of QoS parameters.  There are two types of QoS
parameters:

@enumerate

@item Those that are ``negotiated'' on a per-association basis during transaction association
establishment.@footnote{The connectionless transaction services do not support end-to-end QoS
parameter negotiation.}

@item Those that are not ``negotiated'' and their values are selected or determined by local
management methods.

@end enumerate

@section TRI Primitives: Rules for ITU-T Q.771 Conformance

The following rules apply to the TRI primitives for ITU-T Q.771 (TCAP) compatibility:

@subsection Addressing

TCAP uses SCCP formatted addresses instead of ISO Presentation Layer addresses.

@subsubsection Address Format

The address format for a TCAP address is as follows:

@subsection Options
@subsubsection TCAP Level Options

@subsubheading Application Context Name

@subsubheading User Information

@subsubsection SCCP Level Options

@subsubheading SCCP Quality of Service Options

The TCAP interface uses protocol level @pval{T_SS7_SCCP} for options at the SCCP level.  SCCP QoS
parameters are communicated to the underlying transaction provider using the option name
@pval{T_SCCP_QOS}.  There are three QoS structure that can be used in this fashion as follows:

@center @image{tri_tabn}

Quality of service struct @var{N_qos_sel_sccp_t} has the following fields:

@table @var

@item n_qos_type
This is the NPI Quality of Service structure type and is always set to @pval{N_QOS_SEL_SCCP},
@pval{N_QOS_OPT_SEL_SCCP}, or @pval{N_QOS_RANGE_SCCP}.

@item protocol_class
This is the protocol class.  The @var{protocol_class} field can be one of the following:

@itemize @bullet

@item @pval{N_QOS_PCLASS_0} (SCCP connectionless protocol class 0),

@item @pval{N_QOS_PCLASS_1} (for SCCP connectionless protocol class 1),

@item @pval{N_QOS_PCLASS_2} (for SCCP connection-oriented protocol class 2),

@item @pval{N_QOS_PCLASS_3} (for SCCP connection-oriented protocol class 3) or

@item @pval{QOS_UNKNOWN}.

@end itemize

@pval{N_QOS_PCLASS_2} and @pval{N_QOS_PCLASS_3} are not applicable to TCAP.

@item option_flags
If the @var{options_flags} field has bit @pval{N_QOS_OPT_RETERR} set then the SCCP will return the
PDU on error.

@item importance
This is the importance of the message for consideration for SCCP flow control.  This value is not
normally set by the user.  It can be any integer number from 0 to 7, or @pval{QOS_UNKNOWN}.

@item sequence_selection
This affects the SLS (Signalling Link Selection) value that will be used for protocol classes
@pval{N_QOS_PCLASS_0} and @pval{N_QOS_PCLASS_1}.  This value is not normally set by the user and can
be an integer value or @pval{QOS_UNKNOWN}.

@item message_priority
This affects the MP (Message Priority) value that will be used for specific messages in all protocol
classes.  This value is not normally set by the use and can be any integer value from 0 to 3 or the
value @pval{QOS_UNKNOWN}.

@end table

@section Supported Services
@subsection Common Transaction Services
@subsubsection Information Service

@subsubheading @prim{TR_INFO_REQ}

@subsubheading @prim{TR_INFO_ACK}

@subsubheading Parameters

The following discusses the values which may be returned in a @prim{TR_INFO_ACK} primitive in
response to a @prim{TR_INFO_REQ} primitive.

@table @parm

@item ASDU_size
Depending on the underlying SCCP layer, TCAP can have effectively no limit to the amount of user
data that can be sent in a particular transaction.  Protocol variants or versions of SCCP that
support XUDT and segmentation-reassembly of protocol class 0 or 1 messages will set @parm{ASDU_size}
to @pval{T_INFINITE} (@samp{-1}).  For protocol variants of SCCP or other underlying network
providers that do not support segmentation/reassembly of long messages, the provider wills et
@parm{ASDU_size} to the maximum size (number of octets) of user data that can be guaranteed
transferred when associated with a single @prim{TR_BEGIN_RES} or @prim{TR_CONT_REQ} message.

@item EASDU_size
TCAP has no expedited data service and the value of @parm{EASDU_size} is set to @pval{T_UNKNOWN}
(@samp{-2}).

@item CDATA_size
TCAP can send user data with the initial Begin (Query) or first Continue (Conversation) package and
can also send @dfn{Application Context} and @dfn{User Information} in either package.  These
messages correspond to @dfn{TR-BEGIN} and the first @dfn{TR-CONTINUE} after receiving a
@dfn{TR-BEGIN} and they correspond to @prim{TR_BEGIN_REQ} and @prim{TR_BEGIN_RES}.  Because the
underlying SCCP connectionless network may support unlimited size NSDUs, this value may be set to
@pval{T_INFINITE} (@samp{-1}) or may be set to the maximum amount of user data (including
@dfn{Application Context}, @dfn{User Information} and user data) that can be sent or received in
either package.  This informs the user as to what size to make data buffers associated with
transaction begin indications and confirmations (@prim{TR_BEGIN_IND}, @prim{TR_BEGIN_CON}) and how
much data can be sent with transaction begin requests and responses (@prim{TR_BEGIN_REQ},
@prim{TR_BEGIN_RES}).

@item DDATA_size
TCAP can send transaction end data (user data) with the final End (Response) package.  These
messages correspond to the @dfn{TR-END} primitive and the @prim{TR_END_REQ} or @prim{TR_END_IND}.
Again, because the underlying SCCP connectionless network may support unlimited size NSDUs, this
value may be set to @pval{T_INFINITE} (@samp{-1}) or may be set to the maximum amount of transaction
end data that can be sent or received in the End (Response) package.  This informs the user as to
what size to make data buffers associated with transaction end indications (@prim{TR_END_IND}) and
how much data can be sent with transaction end requests (@prim{TR_END_REQ}).

@item ADDR_size
This is the maximum TCAP address size that can be communicated across the interface.  This address
size is the maximum size of the defined SCCP address structure (@samp{sizeof sccp_addr_t}) that also
will include address digits up to a maximum of @pval{SCCP_MAX_ADDR_LENGTH} octets of digits.  This
informs the user as to what size it should reserver for control buffers so as to receive control
information without buffer truncation.

@item OPT_size
This is the maximum size of the options field used in any TRI message (@pxref{TRI Primitives}) and
is the sum of the maximum option sizes of one of each of the options that can occur together.  This
informs the user as to what size it should reserve for control buffers to ensure that received
control messages that include options cna be contained within the buffer without truncation.

@item TIDU_size
Although a TCAP provider can support unlimited ASDU size, it cannot normally support unlimited TIDU
size.  This is because the underlying SCCP NSDU may be limited in size.  The TCAP provider is not
responsible for segmenting user data sequences offered to the provider from the user in an
@prim{M_DATA} message chain.  This is the maximum size of the TIDU which corresponds to the maximum
size of the underlying NSDU.  Because the underlying SCCP provider may have no limit on the NSDU
size (i.e, it supports segmentation of connectionless NSDUs) this may be more in the manner of a
optimal recommendation to the user rather than an absolute maximum.  Because of this, a given TCAP
provider might not reject TIDUs which are larger than this value.

@item SERV_type
There are two service types supported by a transaction provider: connection-oriented transaction
service (COTS) and connectionless transaction service (CLTS).  CLTS is a connectionless
unidirectional transaction service with no error notification.  COTS is a connection-oriented
transaction services with or without error notification.  The value reflected here is dependent on
the setting of option @pval{T_ACSE_PCLASS} or @pval{T_TCAP_OCLASS}.

@item CURRENT_state
Provides the current state of the transaction interface.  TCAP providers use the same states as
other TRI providers.

@item PROVIDER_flag
Unused.

@item TRI_version
Set to the current version.

@node Addendum for ANSI Conformance
@unnumbered Addendum for ANSI Conformance

This section describes the formats and rules that are specified to ANSI T1.114 operation.  The
addendum must be used along with the generic TRI as defined in the main document when implementing a
TR provider that will be configured with the ANSI T1.114 (TCAP) Transaction Sub-Layer.@footnote{It
should be noted that ANSI T1.114 does not provide a distinction between the TC and TR Sub-Layers of
TCAP, and do not specify a TC-User or TR-User interface at all.  However, as it is still based on
ITU-T Recommendation X.219, there can exist an identifiable TR Sub-Layer interface within ANSI
TCAP.}

@section Quality of Service: Model and Description

The ``Quality of Service'' characteristics apply to both connection-oriented and connectionless
transaction services.

@subsection QoS Overview

QoS (Quality of Service) is described in terms of QoS parameters.  There are two types of QoS
parameters:

@enumerate

@item Those that are ``negotiated'' on a per-association basis during transaction association
establishment.@footnote{The connectionless transaction services do not support end-to-end QoS
parameter negotiation.}

@item Those that are not ``negotiated'' and their values are selected or determined by local
management methods.

@end enumerate

@section TRI Primitives: Rules for ANSI T1.114 Conformance

The following rules apply to the TRI primitives for ANSI T1.114 (TCAP) compatibility:

@subsection Addressing

TCAP uses SCCP formatted addresses instead of ISO Presentation Layer addresses.

@subsubsection Address Format

The address format for a TCAP address is as follows:

@subsection Options
@subsubsection TCAP Level Options

@subsubheading Application Context Name

@subsubheading User Information

@subsubsection SCCP Level Options

@subsubheading SCCP Quality of Service Options

The TCAP interface uses protocol level @pval{T_SS7_SCCP} for options at the SCCP level.  SCCP QoS
parameters are communicated to the underlying transaction provider using the option name
@pval{T_SCCP_QOS}.  There are three QoS structure that can be used in this fashion as follows:

@center @image{tri_tabn}

Quality of service struct @var{N_qos_sel_sccp_t} has the following fields:

@table @var

@item n_qos_type
This is the NPI Quality of Service structure type and is always set to @pval{N_QOS_SEL_SCCP},
@pval{N_QOS_OPT_SEL_SCCP}, or @pval{N_QOS_RANGE_SCCP}.

@item protocol_class
This is the protocol class.  The @var{protocol_class} field can be one of the following:

@itemize @bullet

@item @pval{N_QOS_PCLASS_0} (SCCP connectionless protocol class 0),

@item @pval{N_QOS_PCLASS_1} (for SCCP connectionless protocol class 1),

@item @pval{N_QOS_PCLASS_2} (for SCCP connection-oriented protocol class 2),

@item @pval{N_QOS_PCLASS_3} (for SCCP connection-oriented protocol class 3) or

@item @pval{QOS_UNKNOWN}.

@end itemize

@pval{N_QOS_PCLASS_2} and @pval{N_QOS_PCLASS_3} are not applicable to TCAP.

@item option_flags
If the @var{options_flags} field has bit @pval{N_QOS_OPT_RETERR} set then the SCCP will return the
PDU on error.

@item importance
This is the importance of the message for consideration for SCCP flow control.  This value is not
normally set by the user.  It can be any integer number from 0 to 7, or @pval{QOS_UNKNOWN}.

@item sequence_selection
This affects the SLS (Signalling Link Selection) value that will be used for protocol classes
@pval{N_QOS_PCLASS_0} and @pval{N_QOS_PCLASS_1}.  This value is not normally set by the user and can
be an integer value or @pval{QOS_UNKNOWN}.

@item message_priority
This affects the MP (Message Priority) value that will be used for specific messages in all protocol
classes.  This value is not normally set by the use and can be any integer value from 0 to 3 or the
value @pval{QOS_UNKNOWN}.

@end table

@section Supported Services
@subsection Common Transaction Services
@subsubsection Information Service

@subsubheading @prim{TR_INFO_REQ}

@subsubheading @prim{TR_INFO_ACK}

@subsubheading Parameters

The following discusses the values which may be returned in a @prim{TR_INFO_ACK}
primitive in response to a @prim{TR_INFO_REQ} primitive.
@table @parm

@item ASDU_size
Depending on the underlying SCCP layer, TCAP can have effectively no limit to the amount of user
data that can be sent in a particular transaction.  Protocol variants or versions of SCCP that
support XUDT and segmentation-reassembly of protocol class 0 or 1 messages will set @parm{ASDU_size}
to @pval{T_INFINITE} (@samp{-1}).  For protocol variants of SCCP or other underlying network
providers that do not support segmentation/reassembly of long messages, the provider wills et
@parm{ASDU_size} to the maximum size (number of octets) of user data that can be guaranteed
transferred when associated with a single @prim{TR_BEGIN_RES} or @prim{TR_CONT_REQ} message.

@item EASDU_size
TCAP has no expedited data service and the value of @parm{EASDU_size} is set to @pval{T_UNKNOWN}
(@samp{-2}).

@item CDATA_size
TCAP can send user data with the initial Begin (Query) or first Continue (Conversation) package and
can also send @dfn{Application Context} and @dfn{User Information} in either package.  These
messages correspond to @dfn{TR-BEGIN} and the first @dfn{TR-CONTINUE} after receiving a
@dfn{TR-BEGIN} and they correspond to @prim{TR_BEGIN_REQ} and @prim{TR_BEGIN_RES}.  Because the
underlying SCCP connectionless network may support unlimited size NSDUs, this value may be set to
@pval{T_INFINITE} (@samp{-1}) or may be set to the maximum amount of user data (including
@dfn{Application Context}, @dfn{User Information} and user data) that can be sent or received in
either package.  This informs the user as to what size to make data buffers associated with
transaction begin indications and confirmations (@prim{TR_BEGIN_IND}, @prim{TR_BEGIN_CON}) and how
much data can be sent with transaction begin requests and responses (@prim{TR_BEGIN_REQ},
@prim{TR_BEGIN_RES}).

@item DDATA_size
TCAP can send transaction end data (user data) with the final End (Response) package.  These
messages correspond to the @dfn{TR-END} primitive and the @prim{TR_END_REQ} or @prim{TR_END_IND}.
Again, because the underlying SCCP connectionless network may support unlimited size NSDUs, this
value may be set to @pval{T_INFINITE} (@samp{-1}) or may be set to the maximum amount of transaction
end data that can be sent or received in the End (Response) package.  This informs the user as to
what size to make data buffers associated with transaction end indications (@prim{TR_END_IND}) and
how much data can be sent with transaction end requests (@prim{TR_END_REQ}).

@item ADDR_size
This is the maximum TCAP address size that can be communicated across the interface.  This address
size is the maximum size of the defined SCCP address structure (@samp{sizeof sccp_addr_t}) that also
will include address digits up to a maximum of @pval{SCCP_MAX_ADDR_LENGTH} octets of digits.  This
informs the user as to what size it should reserver for control buffers so as to receive control
information without buffer truncation.

@item OPT_size
This is the maximum size of the options field used in any TRI message (@pxref{TRI Primitives}) and
is the sum of the maximum option sizes of one of each of the options that can occur together.  This
informs the user as to what size it should reserve for control buffers to ensure that received
control messages that include options cna be contained within the buffer without truncation.

@item TIDU_size
Although a TCAP provider can support unlimited ASDU size, it cannot normally support unlimited TIDU
size.  This is because the underlying SCCP NSDU may be limited in size.  The TCAP provider is not
responsible for segmenting user data sequences offered to the provider from the user in an
@prim{M_DATA} message chain.  This is the maximum size of the TIDU which corresponds to the maximum
size of the underlying NSDU.  Because the underlying SCCP provider may have no limit on the NSDU
size (i.e, it supports segmentation of connectionless NSDUs) this may be more in the manner of a
optimal recommendation to the user rather than an absolute maximum.  Because of this, a given TCAP
provider might not reject TIDUs which are larger than this value.

@item SERV_type
There are two service types supported by a transaction provider: connection-oriented transaction
service (COTS) and connectionless transaction service (CLTS).  CLTS is a connectionless
unidirectional transaction service with no error notification.  COTS is a connection-oriented
transaction services with or without error notification.  The value reflected here is dependent on
the setting of option @pval{T_ACSE_PCLASS} or @pval{T_TCAP_OCLASS}.

@item CURRENT_state
Provides the current state of the transaction interface.  TCAP providers use the same states as
other TRI providers.

@item PROVIDER_flag
Unused.

@item TRI_version
Set to the current version.
