@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

This document specifies a @cite{STREAMS}-based
@cpindex STREAMS
kernel-level instantiation of the ITU-T @value{MANUAL_TITLE} definition.  The @value{MANUAL_TITLE} enables the user of a
a message transfer service to access and use any of a variety of conforming message transfer providers without specific
knowledge of the provider's protocol.  The service interface is designed to support any network message transfer protocol
and user message transfer protocol.  This interface only specifies access to message transfer service providers, and does not
address issues concerning message transfer management, protocol performance, and performance analysis tools.

This specification assumes that the reader is familiar with ITU-T state machines and message transfer interfaces (e.g.
Q.704, T1.111.4), and @cite{STREAMS}.

@menu
* Model of the MTPI::

* MTP Service Primitives::
@end menu

The Message Transfer Part Layer provides the means to manage the association of MTP-Users into connections.  It is responsible
for the routing and management of data to and from SS7 network connections between MTP-user entities.

@node Model of the MTPI
@section Model of the MTPI

The MTPI defines the services provided by the signalling link layer to the signalling link user at the boundary between
the signalling link provider and the signalling link user entity.  The interface consists of a set of primitives defined
as @cite{STREAMS}
@cpindex STREAMS
messages that provide access to the signalling link layer services, and are transferred between the MTP user entity and the
MTP provider.  These primitives are of two types; ones that originate from the MTP user, and other that originate from
the MTP provider.  The primitives that originate from the MTP user make requests to the MTP provider, or respond to an
indication of an event of the MTP provider.  The primitives that originate from the MTP provider are either
confirmations of a request or are indications to the CCS user that an event has occurred.  @figref{1} shows the model
of the MTPI.

@figuresized{mtpi01,1,Model of the MTPI,4.0in}

The MTPI allows the MTP provider to be configured with any MTP user (such as ISUP) that also conforms to the MTPI.  A
call control layer user can also be a user program that conforms to the MTPI and accesses the MTP provider via
@command{@b{putmsg}(2s)}
and
@command{@b{getmsg}(2s)}
system calls.

@node MTPI Services
@section MTPI Services

The features of the MTPI are defined in terms of the services provided by the MTP, and the individual primitives that
may flow between the MTP-User and the MTP.

The services supported by the MTPI are based on two distinct modes of communication, connectionless (CLMS) and
connection oriented (COMS).  Within these modes, the MTPI provides support for both sequenced and unsequenced message
transfer.  Also, the MTPI supports services for local mangement.

@subsection CLMS

The main features of the connectionless mode of communication are:

@enumerate
@item
it is datagram oriented;
@item
it provides transfer of data in self contained units;
@item
there is no logical relationship between these units of data.
@end enumerate

Connectionless mode communication has no separate phases.  Each unit of data is transmitted from source to
destination independently, appropriate addressing information is included with each unit of data.  Although the
units of data are transmitted independently from source to destination, MTP provides a high level of assurance of
sequencing if sequenced service is requested.  When unsequenced service is requested, there are no guarantees of
proper sequence.  Although MTP services are inherently unreliable, MTP provide a high level of assurance that
messages are not lost.

The connectionless service of MTP is suited to MTP User protocols such as the Signalling Connection Control Part
(SCCP).@footnote{Q.711}

@subsection COMS

The main features of the MTP connection oriented mode of communication are:

@enumerate
@item
it is virtual circuit oriented;
@item
it provides transfer of data via a pre-established path.
@end enumerate

There are three phases to each instance of communication: Connection Establishment, Data Transfer; and Connection
Termination.  Units of data arrive at their destination in the same order as they departed their source when the
sequenced delivery service is requested and the data is protected against duplication or loss of data within some
specified quality of service.

The connection oriented service of MTP is suited to MTP User protocols such as the Integrated Services Digital Network
User Part (ISUP), [Q.764] Telephone User Part (TUP), [Q.724] and Bearer Indexed Call Control (BICC).@footnote{ISUP
consists of @dfn{signalling relations} between two switches which also have digital facilities between them.  In general
an ISUP MTP-User can communicate with many other MTP-User peers, however, signalling between any given two enpoints only
concerns the digital facilities which exist between the two endpoints.  So, management of ISUP switches is best
performed on a pairing of endpoints (@dfn{signalling relations}).  Also, the COMS mode of operation is provided in
support of DPC list Routing Keys for M3UA. [RFC 4666]}

@subsection Local Management

The MTPI specifications also defines a set of local management functions that apply to COMS and CLMS modes of
communication.  These services have local significance only.

@subsection Provider Management

The MTPI specification also defines a set of provider management functions that apply to the MTP service provider.
These services have local and end-to-end significance.

The format of the primitives will be defined later in this document.

@node Local Management Services
@section Local Management Services

The services defined in this section are outside the scope of international standards.  These services apply to COMS and
CLMS modes of communication.  They are invoked for the initialization/de-initialization of a stream connected to the
MTP.  They are also used to manage options supported by the MTP and to report information on the supported parameter
values.

@subsection Message Transfer Part Information Reporting Service

This service provides information on the options supported by the MTP provider.

@table @strong
@item MTP_INFO_REQ:
This primitive requests that the MTP return the values of all the supported protocol parameters.  This request may be
invoked during any phase.
@item MTP_INFO_ACK:
This primitive is in response to the MTP_INFO_REQ primitive and returns the values of the supported protocol parameters
to the MTP-User.
@end table


The sequence of primitive for MTP information management is shown in @figref{2}.

@figuresized{mtpi02,2,Message Transfer Part Information Reporting Service,4.0in}

@subsection MTP Address Service

This service allows an MTP-User to determine the MTP address (MTP-SAPI or signalling point code and service indicator)
that has been associated with a stream.  It permits the MTP-User to not necessarily retain this information locally, and
allows the MTP-User to determine this information from the MTP provider at any time.

@table @strong
@item MTP_ADDR_REQ:
This primitive requests that the MTP return information concerning which MTP address (MTP-SAPI) the MTP-User is bound as
well as the MTP address upon which the MTP-User is currently engaged in association.
@item MTP_ADDR_ACK:
This primitive is in response to the MTP_ADDR_REQ primitive and indicates to the MTP-User the requested information.
@end table

The sequence of primitives is shown in @figref{3}.

@figuresized{mtpi42,3,Message Transfer Part User Address Service,4.0in}

@subsection MTP User Bind Service


This service allows an MTP address (MTP-SAPI: signalling point code and service indicator) to be associated with a
stream.

It allows the MTP-User to negotiate the number of setup indications that can remain unacknowledged for that MTP-User (a
setup indication is considered unacknowledged while it is awaiting a corresponding setup response or release request
from the MTP-User).  This service also defines a mechanism that allows a stream (bound to an MTP address of the
MTP-User) to be reserved to handle incoming calls only.  This stream is referred to as the listener stream.

@table @strong
@item MTP_BIND_REQ:
This primitive requests that the MTP-User be bound to a particular MTP address (MTP-SAPI), and negotiate the number of
allowable outstanding setup indications for that address.
@item MTP_BIND_ACK:
This primitive is in response to the MTP_BIND_REQ primitive and indicates to the user that the specified MTP-User has
been bound to an MTP address.
@end table

The sequence of primitives is shown in @figref{4}.

@figuresized{mtpi03,4,Message Transfer Part User Bind Service,4.0in}

@subsection MTP User Unbind Service

This service allows the MTP-User to be unbound from an MTP address.

@table @strong
@item MTP_UNBIND_REQ:
This primitive requests that the MTP-User be unbound from the MTP address that it had previously been bound to.
@end table


The sequence of primitives is shown in @figref{5}.

@figuresized{mtpi04,5,Message Transfer Part User Unbind Service,4.0in}

@subsection Receipt Acknolwedgement Service

@table @strong
@item MTP_OK_ACK:
This primitive indicates to the MTP-User that the previous MTP-User originated primitive was received successfully by
the MTP.
@end table


An example showing the sequence of primitives for successful receipt acknowledgement is depicted in
@figref{6}.

@figuresized{mtpi05,6,Message Transfer Part Receipt Ackknowledgement Service,4.0in}

@subsection Options Management Service

This service allows the MTP-User to manage options parameter values associated wtih the MTP.

@table @strong
@item MTP_OPTMGMT_REQ:
This primitive allows the MTP-User to select default values for options parameters within the range supported by the
MTP, and to indicate the default selection of receipt confirmation.
@end table

@figuresized{mtpi06,7,Message Transfer Part Options Management Service,4.0in}

@subsection Error Acknolwedgement Service

@table @strong
@item MTP_ERROR_ACK:
This primitive indicates to the MTP-User that a non-fatal error has occured in the last MTP-User
originated request or response primitive (listed in @figref{8}), on the stream.
@end table

@figref{8} shows the sequence or primitives for the error management primitive.

@figuresized{mtpi07,8,Message Transfer Part Error Acknowledgement Service,4.0in}

@node Connectionless Services
@section Connectionless Services

The CLMS allows for the transfer of MTP-User data in one or both directions simultaneously without establishing an
association between MTP-User peers.  A set of primitives are defined that carry user data and control information
between the MTP-User and MTP entities.  The primitives are modeled as requests initiated by the MTP-User and
indications initiated by the MTP provider.  Indications may be initiated by the MTP independently from requests by
the MTP-User.

The connectionless MTP service consists of one phase.

@subsection Data Transfer

@subsubsection User Primitives for Data Transfer

@table @strong
@item MTP_TRANSFER_REQ:
This primitive requests that the MTP send the data unit to the specified destination with the specified sequence
control.
@end table

@subsubsection Provider Primitives for Data Transfer

@table @strong
@item MTP_TRANSFER_IND:
This primitive indicates to the MTP-User that a data unit has been received from the specified source address.
@end table

@node Connection Oriented Services
@section Connection Oriented Services

This section describes the required MTP service primitives that define the CLMS interface.

The queue model for CLMS is discused in more detail in ITU-T Q.704. [Q.704] For Q.704 specific conformance
considerations, see Addendum 1.

The queue model represents the operation of an MTP connection in the abstract by a pair of queues
linking the two MTP addresses.  There is one queue for each direction of signalling transfer.  The
ability of a user to add objects to a queue will be determined by the behavior of the user removing
objects from that queue, and the state of the queue.  The pair of queues is considered to be
available for each potential association.  Objects that are entered or removed from the queue are
either as a result of interactions at the two MTP addresses, or as the result of MTP initiatives.

@itemize @minus{}
@item
A queue is empty until a connect object has been entered and can be returned to this state, with
loss of its contents, by the MTP.
@item
Objects may be entered into a queue as a result of the action of the source MTP-User, subject to
control by the MTP.
@item
Objects may also be entered into a queue by the MTP.
@item
Objects are removed from the queue under the control of the receiving MTP user.
@item
Objects are normally removed under the control of the MTP-User in the same order as they were
entered except:
@item
if the object is of a type defined to be able to advance ahead of the preceding object (however, no
object is defined to be able to advance ahead of another object of the same type), or
@item
if the following object is defined to be destructive with respect to the preceding object on the
queue.  If necessary, the last object on the queue will be deleted to allow a destructive object to
be entered --- they will therefore always be added to the queue.  For example, "reset" objects are
defined to be destructive with respect to all other objects.
@end itemize

@tabref{5} shows the ordering relationship amoung the queue model objects.

@tabfig{mtpi_tab05,5,Flow Control Relationships Between Queue Model Objects}

@multitable @columnfractions 0.10 0.90
@item AA @tab Indicates that Object X is defined to be able to advance ahead of preceding Object Y.
@item DES @tab Indicates that Object X is defined to be destructive with respect to preceding Object Y.
@item @minus{} @tab Indicates that Object X is neither destructive with respect to Object Y, nor able to advance ahead of Object Y.
@item N/A @tab Indicates that Object X will not occur in a position succeeding Object Y in a valid state of a queue.
@end multitable

@subsection Connection Establishment Phase

A pair of queues is associated with an MTP association between two MTP addresses when the MTP receives an MTP_CONN_REQ
primitive at one of the MTP addresses resulting in a connect object being entered into the queue.  The queues will
remain associated with the MTP association until an MTP_DISCON_REQ primitive (resulting in a disconnect object) is either
entered or removed from a queue.  Similarly, in the queue from the remote MTP-User, objects can be entered into the
queue only after the connect object associated with an MTP_CONN_REQ has been entered into the queue.

The MTP association procedure will fail if the MTP is unable to route to the remote MTP-User.

@subsubsection User primitives for Successful MTP Association Establishment

@table @strong
@item MTP_CONN_REQ:
This primitive requests that the MTP establish an association between the local MTP-User and the specified destination.
@end table

@subsubsection Provider primitives for Successful MTP Association Establishment

@table @strong
@item MTP_CONN_CON:
This primitive indicates to the MTP-User that an association request has been confirmed.

The sequence of primitives in a successful MTP association establishment is defined by the time sequence diagram as
shown in @figref{11}.

@figuresized{mtpi24,11,Message Transfer Part Association Service,4.0in}

@subsection Data Transfer Phase

Flow control on the MTP association is done by management of queue capacity, by allowing objects of certain type to be
inserted to the queues as shown in @tabref{5}.

sequence of primitives may remain complete if an @code{MTP_DISCON} primitive occurs.

@figuresized{mtpi31,13,Message Transfer Part Error Management,4.0in}

@subsection Connection Termination Phase

The MTP association release procedure is initialized by the insertion of a disconnect object (associated with an
@code{MTP_DISCON_REQ}) into the queue.  As shown in @figref{13}, the disconnect procedure is destructive with respect to
other objects in the queue, and eventually results in the emptying of queues and termination of the MTP association.

@node MTP Provider Management Services
@section MTP Provider Management Services

This section describes the required MTP service primitives that define the MTP Provider Management interface.

MTP Provider Management allows for the coordination of MTP mangement messages between MTP Provider peers.  A set of
primitives are defined that invoke management actions which are communicated from MTP to MTP entities.  The primitives
are modeled as requires initiated by the MTP management and indications initiated by the MTP.  Indications may be
initiated by the MTP independently from requests by the MTP management.

The MTP Provider Management service consists of one phase.

@item mtp_addr_length
Is the length of the MTP address (MTP-SAPI) that was bound.
@item mtp_addr_offset
Is the offset from the beginning of the M_PCPROTO block where the MTP address (MTP-SAPI) begins.

The proper alignment of the address in the M_PCPROTO message block is not guaranteed.
@end vtable

@subsubheading Rules

The following rules apply to the binding of the specified MTP address to the stream:

@itemize ---
@item
If the @var{mtp_addr_length} field in the MTP_BIND_REQ primitive is zero, then the MTP is to assign
an MTP address (MTP-SAPI) to the user.
@item
The MTP is to bind the MTP address (MTP-SAPI) as specified in the MTP_BIND_REQ primitive.  If the
MTP cannot bind the specified address, it may assign another MTP address to the user.  It is the
MTP-User's responsibility to check the MTP address returned in the MTP_BIND_ACK primitive to see if
it is the same as the one requested.
@end itemize

@emph{If the above rules result in an error condition, then the MTP must issue an MTP_ERROR_ACK
primitive to the MTP-User specifying the error as defined in the description of the MTP_BIND_REQ
primitive.}

@node Signalling Relation Establishment Phase
@subsection Signalling Relation Establishment Phase

The following MTP service primitives pertain to the establishment of an association between local and remote MTP-SAPs,
provided the MTP users exist, and are known to the MTP.

@subsubsection Message Transfer Part Connection Request
@subsubheading MTP_CONN_REQ
@prindex MTP_CONN_REQ

This primitive requests that the MTP form an association to the specified destination.

@subsubheading Format

The format of the message is one M_PROTO message block.  The structure of the M_PROTO message block is as follows:

@smallexample
typedef struct MTP_conn_req @{
        mtp_ulong mtp_primitive;        /* always MTP_CONN_REQ */
        mtp_ulong mtp_addr_length;      /* length of MTP address to connect */

@} MTP_conn_req_t;
@tpindex struct MTP_conn_req
@tpindex MTP_conn_req_t
@end smallexample

@subsubheading Parameters

@vtable @var
@item mtp_primitive
Specifies the primitive type.  This field is always coded MTP_CONN_REQ.
@item mtp_addr_length
Specifies the length of the MTP address (MTP-SAPI) of the peer to which a signalling relation is to be established.
If no MTP address is provided by the MTP-User, this field must be coded zero (0).
The coding of the MTP address (MTP-SAPI) is protocol and provider-specific.
@item mtp_addr_offset
Specifies the offset of the MTP address (MTP-SAPI) from the beginning of the M_PROTO message block.
@item mtp_conn_flags
Indicates a bit field of connection options.  (See @emph{Flags} below.)
@end vtable

@subsubheading Flags

@subsubheading Rules

The following rules apply to the establishment of associations between the specified addresses:

@itemize ---
@item
If the @var{mtp_addr_length} field in the MTP_CONN_REQ primitive is zero, then the MTP is to select a remote MTP address
(MTP-SAPI) with which to associate.  If the MTP cannot select a address for the association, the MTP responds with an
MTP_ERROR_ACK primitive with error MNOADDR.
@item
If the @var{mtp_addr_length} field in the MTP_CONN_REQ primitive is non-zero, the MTP is to associate with the specified
remote MTP address (MTP-SAPI).  if the MTP cannot associate with the specified remote MTP address (MTP-SAPI), the
primitive will fail and the MTP will return an MTP_ERROR_ACK primitive with the appropriate error value (e.g, MBADADDR).
@end itemize

The following rules apply to the MTP addresses (MTP-SAPIs):

@itemize ---
@item
If the MTP-User does not specify an MTP address (i.e. @var{mtp_addr_length} is set to zero), then the MTP may attempt to
assign a remote MTP address (MTP-SAPI) and associate it with the stream for the duration of the association.
@end itemize

@subsubheading Valid States

This primitive is valid in state MTPS_IDLE.

@subsubheading New State

The new state is MTPS_DATA_XFER.

@subsubheading Acknowledgements

The following acknolwedgements are valid for this primitive:

@itemize ---
@item @emph{Successful}: Correct acknowledgement of the primtive is indicated via the MTP_OK_ACK primitive.
@item @emph{Unsuccessful (Non-fatal errors)}:  These are indicated via the MTP_ERROR_ACK primitive.  The applicable
non-fatal errors are defined as follows:
@vtable @var
@item MSYSERR
A system error has occurred and the UNIX system eror is indicated in the primitive.
@item MOUTSTATE
The primitive was issued from an invalid state.
@item MBADADDR
The MTP address as specified in the primitive was in an incorrect format, or the address contained illegal information.
@item MNOADDR
The user did not provide an MTP address and one was required by the MTP.  The MTP could not select a remote MTP address
(MTP-SAPI).
@item MADDRBUSY
The MTP could not use the specified address because the specified address is already in use.
@item MBADFLAG
The specified flags were invalid.
@item MNOTSUPPORT
The primitive is not supported for by the MTP provider.
@item MBADPRIM
The primitive was of an incorrect format (i.e. too small, or an offset it out of range).
@item MACCESS
The user did not have proper permissions for the use of the requested address.
@end vtable
@end itemize

@page
@node Signalling Relation Data Transfer Phase
@subsection Signalling Relation Data Transfer Phase

The data transfer service primitive provide for an exchange of MTP-User data, known as MSDUs, in either direction or in
both directions simultaneously on a signalling relation.  The MTP service preserves the sequence of MSDUs that have the
same Signalling Link Selection (SLS) value specified in the MTP_TRANSFER_REQ.  MSDUs are self-contained messages with
implicit boundaries.

The following MTP service primtiives pertain to the Data Transfer phase of a signalling relation.

@subsubsection Message Transfer Part Transfer Request
@subsubheading MTP_TRANSFER_REQ
@prindex MTP_TRANSFER_REQ

This user-originated primitive indicates to the MTP that this message contains MTP-User data.  It allows the transfer of
MTP-User data between MTP-Users, without modification by the MTP provider.

The MTP-User must send an integral number of octets of data greater than zero.  In a case where the size of the MSDU
exceeds the MIDU (as specified by the size of the MIDU_size parameter of the MTP_INFO_ACK primitive), the MSDU may be
broken up into more than one MIDU.  When an MSDU is broken up into more than one MIDU, the MTP_MORE_DATA_FLAG will be
set on each MIDU except the last one.

@subsubheading Format

The format of the message is one or more M_DATA blocks.  Use of a M_PROTO message block is optional.  The M_PROTO
message block is used for two reasons:

@enumerate
@item
to indicate that the MSDU is broken into more than one MIDU, and that the data carried in the following M_DATA message
block constitutes one MIDU;
@item
to indicate the message priority and signalling link selection to be associated with the MSDU.
@end enumerate

@noindent
@emph{Guidelines for the use of M_PROTO}

The following guidelines must be followed with respect to the use of the M_PROTO message block:

@enumerate
@item
The M_PROTO message block need not be present when the MSDU size is less than or equal to the MIDU size and one of the
following is true:
@itemize @minus{}
@item
the values of the message priority and signalling link selection have been previously set with the MTP_OPTMGMT_REQ
primitive; or
@item
the default values of the message priority and signalling link selection are to be specified.
@end itemize
@item
The M_PROTO message block must be present when:
@itemize @minus{}
@item
The MSDU size is greater than the MIDU size.
@item
the values of the message priority or signalling link selection as specified by the MTP_OPTMGMT_REQ primitive needs to
be overriden for this MSDU.
@end itemize
@end enumerate

The format of the M_PROTO message block, if present, is as follows:

@smallexample
typedef struct MTP_transfer_req @{
        mtp_ulong mtp_primitive;        /* always MTP_TRANSFER_REQ */
        mtp_ulong mtp_dest_length;      /* length of destination address */
        mtp_ulong mtp_dest_offset;      /* offset of destination address */
        mtp_ulong mtp_mp;               /* message priority */
        mtp_ulong mtp_sls;              /* signalling link selection */
@} MTP_transfer_req_t;
@tpindex struct MTP_transfer_req
@tpindex MTP_transfer_req_t
@end smallexample

@subsubheading Parameters

@vtable @var
@item mtp_primitive
Specifies the primitive type.  This field is always coded @var{MTP_TRANSFER_REQ}.
@item mtp_dest_length
Specifies the length of the destination MTP address (MTP-SAPI) to which the message is to be sent.  If the stream is
connected in an established signalling relation, this field may be coded zero (0).
@item mtp_dest_offset
Specifies the offset of the destination MTP address (MTP-SAPI) from the beginning of the M_PROTO message block.
@item mtp_mp
Specifies the message priority to be used when sending the message.  Support for message priority is protocol variant
and provider specific.
@item mtp_sls
Specifies the signalling link selection value to be used when sending the message.  If this field is coded MTP_UNKNOWN
(-1) then the MTP provider will choose a value of the signalling link selection which best performs loadsharing of the
resulting message traffic.
@end vtable

@subsubheading Rules

If the signalling relation is associated with a single destination address (MTP-SAPI), M_DATA blocks can be used with no
M_PROTO block to transfer messages.  The destination adddress and the values of SLS and MP will be the default values or
the laster values that were successfully set with MTP_OPTMGMT_REQ.

@subsubheading Valid States

This primitive is valid in state MTP_IDLE for connectionless streams and in state MTP_DATA_XFER for pseudo-connection
oriented streams.

@subsubheading New State

The new state is unchanged.

@subsubheading Acknowledgements

This primitive does not require any acknowledgements, although it may generate a fatal error.  This is indicated to the
MTP-User via a M_ERROR STREAMS message type (specifying an errno value of EPROTO) which results in the failure of all
system calls on that stream.  The applicable errors are defined as follows:

@vtable @var
@item EPROTO
This indicates one of the following unrecoverable protocol conditions:
@itemize ---
@item
The MTP interface was found to be in an incorrect state.
@item
The amount of MTP-User data associated wtih the primitive was outside the range supported by the MTP (as specified in
the MIDU_size parameter of the MTP_INFO_ACK primitive).
@item
The options requested are either not support by the MTP.
@item
The M_PROTO message block was not followed by one or more M_DATA message blocks.
@item
The amount of MTP-User data associated with the current MSDU is outside the range supported by the MTP (as specified by
the MSDU_size parameter in the MTP_INFO_ACK primitive.)
@item
The flags field contained an unknown value.
@end itemize

@strong{Note.} @i{If the interface is in the MTP_IDLE state when the provider received the MTP_TRANSFER_REQ primitive,
then the MTP should discard the request without generating a fatal error.}

@node Diagnostics Requirements
@chapter Diagnostics Requirements

Two error handling facilities should be provided to the MTP user: one to handle non-fatal errors, and the other
to handle fatal errors.

@section Non-Fatal Error Handling Facility

These are errors that do not change the state of the MTP service interface as seen by the MTP service user, and provide
the user the option of reissuing the MTP service primitive with the corrected options specification.  The non-fatal
error handling is provided only to those primitive that require acknowledgements, and uses the @code{MTP_ERROR_ACK}
primitive to report these errors.  These errors retain the state of hte MTP service interface the same as it was before
the MTP service provider received the primitive that was in error.  Syntax errros and rule violations are reported via
the non-fatal error handling facility.

@section Fatal Error Handling Facility

These errors are issued by the MAP provider when it detects errors that are not correctable by the MAP user, or if it is
unable to report a correctible error to the MTP user.  Fatal errors are indicated via the STREAMS message type
@code{M_ERROR} with the UNIX system error @code{EPROTO}.  The @code{M_ERROR} STREAMS message type will result in the
failure of all the UNIX system calls on the stream.  The MTP user can recover from a fatal error by having all
the processes close the files associated with the stream, and then reopening them for processing.

@node Addendum for ITU-T Q.704 Conformance
@unnumbered Addendum for ITU-T Q.704 Conformance

This addendum describes the formats and rules that are specific to ETSI EN 300 008-1 V3.2.2.  The addendum must be used
along with the generic MTPI as defined int the main document, and the Q.704 conformance defined in Addendum 2, when
implementing an MTP that will be configured with the EN 300 008-1 message transfer part.

@unnumberedsec Primitives and Rules for ETSI EN 300 008-1 V3.2.2 Conformance

The following are the additional rules that apply to the MTPI primitives for ETSI EN 300 008-1 V3.2.2 compatibility.

@node Mapping MTPI Primitives to Q.701
@appendix Mapping MTPI Primitives to Q.701

Table A-1 shows the mapping of the MTPI primitives to the MTP definition primitives listed in ITU-T Recommendation
Q.704.

The mapping of MTPI primitives to Q.701 primitives is shown in @tabref{6}.  For the most part, this mapping
is a one to one mapping of service primitives, with the exception of @emph{Connect Request} and @emph{Disconnect
Request}.

In Q.701 there is not concept of an @dfn{association} between MTP-entities.  In OpenSS7 MTPI, the MTP_CONN_REQ and
MTP_DISCON_REQ primitives are used to establish and release an association between MTP-entities.

@appendix Mapping of MTPI Primitives to ANSI T1.111.1

In T1.111.1 there is not concept of an @dfn{association} between MTP-entities.  In OpenSS7 MTPI, the MTP_CONN_REQ and
MTP_DISCON_REQ primitives are used to establish and release an association between MTP-entities.

@table @emph

@item Signalling Data Link Service Data Unit

A grouping of SDL user data whose boundaries are preserved from one end of the signalling data link connection to the
other.

@item Data transfer

The phase in connection and connectionless modes that supports the transfer of data between to signalling data link
users.

@item SDL provider

The signalling data link layer protocol that provides the services of the signalling data link interface.

@item SDL user

The user-level application or user-level or kernel-level protocol that accesses the services of the signalling data link
layer.

@item Local management

The phase in connection and connectionless modes in which a SDL user initializes a stream and attaches a PPA address to
the stream.  Primitives in this phase generate local operations only.

@item PPA

The point at which a system attaches itself to a physical communications medium.

@item PPA identifier

An identifier of a particular physical medium over which communication transpires.
