@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

This document specifies a STREAMS-based kernel-level instantiation of the
ISO/CCITT network service definition.  The Network Provider Interface (NPI)
enables the user of a network layer service to access and use any of a variety
of conforming network layer service providers without specific knowledge of the
provider's protocol.  The service interface is designed to support any
connection-mode network protocol and connectionless network protocol.  This
interface only specifies access to network layer service providers, and does not
address issues concerning network layer management,protocol performance, and
performance analysis tools.

The specification assumes that the reader is familiar with the OSI reference
model terminology, ISO/CCITT Network Layer Service, and STREAMS.

@chapter The Network Layer

@end ifnotinfo

The Network Layer provides the means to manage the operation of the network.  It
is responsible for the routing and management of data exchange between
network-user entities.

@node Model of the NPI
@section Model of the NPI

The NPI defines the services provided by the network layer to the network-user
at the boundary between the network layer and the network layer user entity.  The
interface consists of a set of primitives defined as STREAMS messages that
provide access to the network layer services, and are transferred between the NS
user entity and the NS provider.  These primitives are of two types; ones that
originate from the NS user, and others that originate from the NS provider.  The
primitives that originate from the NS user make requests to the NS provider, or
respond to an event of the NS provider.  The primitives that originate from the
NS provider are either confirmations of a request or are indications to the NS
user that the event has occurred.  Figure 1 shows the model of the NPI.

@cartouche
@image{npi_fig1,4in} @center @b{Figure 1.  Model of the NPI}
@end cartouche

The NPI allows the NS provider to be configured with any network layer user
(such as the OSI Transport Layer) that also conforms to the NPI.  A network layer
user can also be a user program that conforms to the NPI and accesses the NS
provider via ``putmsg'' and ``getmsg'' system calls.

@node NPI Services
@section NPI Services

@ifnotinfo
@menu
* CONS::
* CLNS::
* Local Management::
@end menu
@end ifnotinfo

The features of the NPI are defined in terms of the services provided by the NS
provider,and the individual primitives that may flow between the NS user and the
NS provider.

The services supported by the NPI are based on two distinct modes of
communication, connection (CONS) and connectionless (CLNS).  In addition, the NPI
supports services for local management.

@node CONS
@subsection CONS

The main features of the connection mode communication are:

@enumerate a

@item It is virtual circuit oriented;

@item It provides transfer of data via a pre-established path;

@item It provides reliable data transfer.

@end enumerate

There are three phases to each instance of communication: Connection
Establishment; Data Transfer; and Connection Termination.  Units of data arrive
at their destination in the same order as they departed their source and the
data is protected against duplication or loss of data units within some
specified quality of service.

@node CLNS
@subsection CLNS

The main features of the connectionless mode communication are:

@enumerate a

@item It is datagram oriented;

@item It provides transfer of data in self contained units;

@item There is no logical relationship between these units of data;

@item It is unreliable.

@end enumerate

Connectionless mode communication has no separate phases.  Each unit of data
is transmitted from source to destination independently, appropriate addressing
information is included with each unit of data.  As the units of data are
transmitted independently from source to destination, there are, in general, no
guarantees of proper sequence and completeness of the data stream.

@node Local Management
@subsection Local Management

The NPI specifications also define a set of local management functions that
apply to both CONS and CLNS modes of communication.  These services have local
significance only.

Tables 1 and 2 summarizes the NPI service primitives by their state and service.

This section describes the services of the NPI primitives.  Time-sequence

for the time-sequence diagrams are defined in CCITT X.210 [8].) The format of
the primitives will be defined later in this document.

The services defined in this section are outside the scope of the international
standards.  These services apply to both connection-mode as well as the
connection-less modes of communication.  They are invoked for the
initialization/de-initialization of a stream connected to the NS provider.  They
are also used to manage options supported by the NS provider and to report
information on the supported parameter values.

@node Network Information Reporting Service
@subsection Network Information Reporting Service

This service provides information on the options supported by the NS provider.

@itemize @bullet

@item N_INFO_REQ: This primitive requests that the NS provider return the
values of all the supported protocol parameters.  This request may be invoked
during any phase.

@item N_INFO_ACK: This primitive is in response to the N_INFO_REQ primitive
and returns the values of the supported protocol parameters to the NS user.

@end itemize

The sequence of primitives for network information management is shown in Figure 2.

@node NS User Bind Service
@subsection NS User Bind Service

This service allows a network address to be associated with a stream.  It allows
the NS user to negotiate the number of connect indications that can remain
unacknowledged for that NS user (a connect indication is considered
unacknowledged while it is awaiting a corresponding connect response or
disconnect request from the NS user).  This service also defines a mechanism that
allows a stream (bound to a network address of the NS user) to be reserved to
handle incoming calls only.  This stream is referred to as the listener stream.

@itemize @bullet

@item N_BIND_REQ: This primitive requests that the NS user be bound to a
particular network address, and negotiate the number of allowable outstanding
connect indications for that address.

@item N_BIND_ACK: This primitive is in response to the N_BIND_REQ primitive
and indicates to the user that the specified NS user has been bound to a network
address.

@end itemize

The sequence of primitives for NS user bind service is shown in Figure 3.

@image{npi_fig3,4in} @center @b{Figure 3.  Sequence of Primitives; NS User Bind Service}
@end cartouche

@node NS User Unbind Service
@subsection NS User Unbind Service

This service allows the NS user to be unbound from a network address.

@itemize @bullet

@item N_UNBIND_REQ: This primitive requests that the NS user be unbound from
the network address that it had previously been bound to.

@end itemize

The sequence of primitives for NS user unbind service is shown in Figure 4.

@cartouche
@image{npi_fig4,4in} @center @b{Figure 4.  Sequence of Primitives; NS User Unbind & Receipt Acknowledgement}

@node Receipt Acknowledgement Service
@subsection Receipt Acknowledgement Service

@itemize @bullet

@item N_OK_ACK: This primitive indicates to the NS user that the previous NS
user originated primitive was received successfully by the NS provider.

@end itemize

An example showing the sequence of primitives for successful receipt
acknowledgement is depicted in Figure 4.

@node Options Management Service
@subsection Options Management Service

This service allows the NS user to manage the QOS parameter values associated
with the NS provider.

@itemize @bullet

@item N_OPTMGMT_REQ: This primitive allows the NS user to select default
values for QOS parameters within the range supported by the NS provider, and to
indicate the default selection of receipt confirmation.

error has occurred in the last NS user originated request or response primitive
(listed in Figure 6), on the stream.

This section describes the required network service primitives that define the
CONS interface.

The queue model for CONS is discussed in more detail in CCITT X.213 section 9.2.
The queue model represents the operation of a network connection in the abstract
by a pair of queues linking the two network addresses.  There is one queue for
each direction of information flow.  Each queue represents a flow control
function in one direction of transfer.  The ability of a user to add objects to a
queue will be determined by the behaviour of the user removing objects from that
queue, and the state of the queue.  The pair of queues is considered to be
available for each potential NC.  Objects that are entered or removed from the
queue are either as a result of interactions at the two network addresses, or as
the result of NS provider initiatives.

@itemize @bullet

@item A queue is empty until a connect object has been entered and can be
returned to this state, with loss of its contents, by the NS provider.

@item Objects may be entered into a queue as a result of the actions of the
source NS user, subject to control by the NS provider;

@item Objects may also be entered into a queue by the NS provider.

@item Objects are removed from the queue under the control of the receiving NS user.

@item Objects are normally removed under the control of the NS user in the same
order as they were entered except:

@itemize ---

@item if the object is of a type defined to be able to advance ahead of the
preceding object (however, no object is defined to be able to advance ahead of
another object of the same type), or

@item if the following object is defined to be destructive with respect to the
preceding object on the queue.  If necessary, the last object on the queue will
be deleted to allow a destructive object to be entered - they will therefore
always be added to the queue.  For example, ``disconnect'' objects are defined to be
destructive with respect to all other objects.  ``Reset'' objects are defined to be
destructive with respect to all other objects except ``connect'', ``disconnect'', and
other ``reset'' objects.

@end itemize

@end itemize

Table 3 shows the ordering relationships among the queue model objects.

@cartouche
@image{npi_tab3} @center @b{Table 3.  Ordering Relationships Between Queue Model Objects}
@end cartouche

@node Connection Establishment Phase
@subsection Connection Establishment Phase

A pair of queues is associated with an NC between two network addresses when the
NS provider receives an N_CONNECT_REQ primitive at one of the network addresses
resulting in a connect object being entered into the queue.  The queues will
remain associated with the NC until a N_DISCON_REQ primitive (resulting in a
disconnect object) is either entered or removed from a queue.  Similarly, in the
queue from the called NS user, objects can be entered into the queue only after
the connect object associated with the N_CONN_RES has been entered into the
queue.  Alternatively, the called NS user can enter a disconnect object into the
queue instead of the connect object to terminate the NC.  The NC establishment
procedure will fail if the NS provider is unable to establish an NC,or if the
destination NS user is unable to accept the N_CONN_IND (see NC Release
primitive definition).

@subsubsection User Primitives for Successful Network Connection Establishment

@ 

@itemize @bullet

@item N_CONN_REQ: This primitive requests that the NS provider make a
connection to the specified destination.

@item N_CONN_RES: This primitive requests that the NS provider accept a
previous connection indication.

@end itemize

@subsubsection Provider Primitives for Successful Network Connection Establishment

@ 

@itemize @bullet

@item N_CONN_IND: This primitive indicates to the NS user that a connect
request has been made by a user at the specified source address.

@item N_CONN_CON: This primitive indicates to the NS user that a connect
request has been confirmed on the specified responding address.

@end itemize

The sequence of primitives in a successful NC establishment is defined by the
time sequence diagram as shown in Figure 7.  The sequence of primitives for the
NC response token value determination is shown in Figure 8 (procedures for NC
response token value determination are discussed in sections 4.1.3 and 4.1.4.).

@end cartouche

@node Data Transfer Phase
@subsection Data Transfer Phase

Flow control on the NC is done by management of the queue capacity, and by
allowing objects of certain types to be inserted to the queues, as shown in
Table 4.

@cartouche
@image{npi_tab4} @center @b{Table 4.  Flow Control Relationships Between Queue Model Objects}

confirmation requested.

@item N_EXDATA_IND: This primitive indicates to the NS user that this message

Figure 9 shows the sequence of primitives for successful normal data transfer.
The sequence of primitives may remain incomplete if a N_RESET or N_DISCON
primitive occurs.

@end cartouche

The sequence of primitives as shown above may remain incomplete if an N_RESET
or an N_DISCON primitive occurs (see Table 3).  A NS user must not issue an
N_DATACK_REQ primitive if no N_DATA_IND with confirmation request set has
been received, or if all such N_DATA_IND have been previously acknowledged.
Following a reset procedure (N_RESET_REQ or N_RESET_IND), a NS user may not
issue aN_DATACK_REQ to acknowledge an outstanding N_DATA_IND received before the
reset procedure was signalled.

Note --- The withholding of confirmation of receipt by a NS user can have an
effect on the attainable throughput on the NC.

The sequence of primitives for expedited data transfer is shown in the time
sequence diagram in Figure 11.  This sequence of primitives may remain incomplete
if a N_RESET or N_DISCON primitive is issued.

@node Reset Operation Primitives
@subsection Reset Operation Primitives

The reset service is used by the NS user to resynchronize the use of the NC, or
by the NS provider to report detected loss of unrecoverable data.

The reset procedure involves the following interactions:

@enumerate A

@item a N_RESET_REQ from the NS user, followed by a N_RESET_CON from the
NS provider; or

@item a N_RESET_IND from the NS provider, followed by a N_RESET_RES from the NS
user.

@end enumerate

The complete sequence of primitives depends upon the origin/s of the reset
action.  The reset service may be:

@enumerate 1

@item invoked by one NS user, leading to interaction (A) with that NS user
and interaction (B) with the peer NS user;

@item invoked by both NS users, leading to interaction (A) with both NS users;

@item invoked by the NS provider, leading to interaction (B) with both NS users;

@item invoked by one NS user and the NS provider, leading to interaction (A)
with the originating NS user and (B) with the peer NS user.

@end enumerate

The N_RESET_REQ acts as a synchronization mark in the flow of N_DATA,N_EXDATA,
and N_DATACK primitives transmitted by the issuing NS user; the N_RESET_IND acts
as a synchronization mark in the flow of N_DATA, N_EXDATA,and N_DATACK
primitives received by the receiving NS user.  Similarly, N_RESET_RES acts as a
synchronization mark in the flow of N_DATA, N_EXDATA,and N_DATACK primitives
transmitted by the responding NS user, while the N_RESET_CON acts as a
synchronization mark in the flow of N_DATA, N_EXDATA, and N_DATACK primitives
received by the NS user that originally issued the reset.  The resynchronizing
properties of the reset service are the following:

@enumerate a

@item All N_DATA, N_EXDATA, and N_DATACK primitives issued before issuing
the N_RESET_REQ/N_RESET_RES that have not been delivered to the other NS user
before the N_RESET_IND/N_RESET_CON are issued by the NS provider,should be
discarded by the NS provider.

@item Any N_DATA, N_EXDATA, and N_DATACK primitives issued after
the synchronization mark will not be delivered to the other NS user before the
synchronization mark is received.

@end enumerate

@subsubsection User Primitives for Reset Operations

@ 

@itemize @bullet

@item N_RESET_REQ: This primitive requests that the NS provider reset the
network connection.

@item N_RESET_RES: This primitive indicates to the NS provider that the NS user
has accepted a reset indication.

@end itemize

@subsubsection Provider Primitives for Reset Operations

@ 

@itemize @bullet

@item N_RESET_IND: This primitive indicates to the NS user that the
network connection has been reset.

@item N_RESET_CON: This primitive indicates to the NS user that the reset
request has been confirmed.

@end itemize

The sequence of primitives as shown in Figures 12, 13, 14, and 15 may
remain in complete if a N_DISCON primitive occurs.

@node Connection Termination Phase
@subsection Connection Termination Phase

The NC release procedure is initialized by the insertion of a disconnect
object (associated with a N_DISCON_REQ) into the queue.  As shown in Table 3, the
disconnect procedure is destructive with respect to other objects in the queue,
and eventually results in the emptying of queues and termination of the NC
connection.

The sequence of primitives depends on the origin of the release action.  The
sequence may be:

@enumerate 1

@item invoked by one NS user, with a request from that NS user leading to an
indication to the other;

@item invoked by both NS users, with a request from each of the NS users;

@item invoked by the NS provider, with an indication to each of the NS users;

@item invoked independently by one NS user and the NS provider, with a request
from the originating NS user and an indication to the other.

@end enumerate

@subsubsection User Primitives for Connection Termination

@ 

@itemize @bullet

@item N_DISCON_REQ: This primitive requests that the NS provider deny
an outstanding request for a connection or disconnect an existing connection.

@end itemize

@subsubsection Provider Primitives for Connection Termination

@ 

@itemize @bullet

@item N_DISCON_IND: This primitive indicates to the NS user that either a
request for connection has been denied or an existing connection has been
terminated.

@end itemize

The sequence of primitives are shown in the time sequence diagrams in Figures
16, 17, 18, and 19.

@node Connectionless Network Services Definition
@section Connectionless Network Services Definition

The CLNS allows for the transfer of the NS user data in one or both directions
simultaneously without establishing a network connection.  A set of primitives
are defined that carry user data and control information between the NS user and
NS provider entities.  The primitives are modelled as requests initiated by the
NS user and indications initiated by the NS provider.  Indications may be
initiated by the NS provider independently from requests by the NS user.

The connectionless network service consists of one phase.

@subsection User Request Primitives

@subsubheading Parameters

The above fields have the following meaning:

@vtable @var

@item PRIM_type
Indicates the primitive type.

@item NSDU_size
Specifies the maximum size (in octets) of a Network Service Data Unit (NSDU)
supported by the NS provider.

@item ENSDU_size
Specifies the maximum size (in octets) of an Expedited Network Service Data Unit
(ENSDU) supported by the NS provider.

@item CDATA_size
Specifies the maximum number of octets of data that may be associated with
connection establishment primitives.

@item DDATA_size
Specifies the maximum number of octets of data that may be associated with the
disconnect primitives.

@item ADDR_size
Specifies the maximum size (in decimal digits) of a network address.

@item ADDR_length
Specifies the length in bytes of the network address bound on the STREAM on
which the N_INFO_REQ was issued (a network address is bound to a STREAM via a
N_BIND_REQ).

@item ADDR_offset
Specifies the offset of the bound network address from the beginning of the
M_PCPROTO message block (this field should be ignored if the ADDR_length field
is zero).

@item QOS_length
in an addendum to this document.  In the connection-mode environment, when this
primitive is invoked before the NC is established on the stream, the values
returned specify the the default values supported by the NS provider.  When this
primitive is invoked after a NC has been established on the stream, the values
returned indicate the negotiated values for the QOS parameters.  In the
connection-less environment, these values represent the default or the selected
QOS parameter values.  In case a QOS parameter is not supported by the NS
Provider, a value of QOS_UNKNOWN will be returned.  In the case where no QOS
parameters are supported by the NS provider, this field will be zero.

@item QOS_offset
Indicates the offset of the QOS parameters from the beginning of the M_PCPROTO
message block.

@item QOS_range_length
Indicates the length in bytes, of the available range of QOS parameters values
supported by the NS provider.  These ranges are used by the NS user to select QOS
parameter values that are valid with the NS provider.  QOS parameter values are
selected, or the default values altered via the N_OPTMGMT_REQ primitive.  In the
connection-mode environment, the values for end-to-end QOS parameters may be
specified with the N_CONN primitives for negotiation.  If the NS provider does
not support a certain QOS parameter, its value will be set to QOS_UNKNOWN.  In
the case where no QOS parameters are supported by the NS provider, the length
of this field will be zero.

@item QOS_range_offset
Indicates the offset of the range of QOS parameter values from the beginning of
the M_PCPROTO message block.

@item OPTIONS_flags
Defines flags that indicate whether the options described below are supported by
the NS provider.  The possible options are receipt confirmation, expedited data
and default selection for use of receipt confirmation.

@item NIDU_size
This indicates the amount of user data that may be present in a N_DATA primitive.
The NIDU_size should not be larger than the NSDU_size specification.

@item SERV_type
Specifies the service type supported by the NS provider.  The possible values can
be N_CONS, N_CLNS, (or both as indicated by using N_CONS|N_CLNS).

@item CURRENT_state
This indicates the current state of the NS provider.

@item PROVIDER_type
This indicates the type of NS provider.  The possible values can be N_SNICFP or
N_SUBNET.  The value N_SNICFP indicates that the provider is the Subnetwork
Independent Convergence Function/Protocol sub-layer of the network layer.  The
value N_SUBNET indicates that the provider is a subnetwork.

@item NODU_size
This specifies the optimal NSDU size (in octets) of an NSDU given the current
routing information.

@item PROTOID_length
This specifies the length of the protocol ids that were bound using the
N_BIND_REQ.

@item PROTOID_offset
This specifies the offset of the protocol ids that were bound using the
N_BIND_REQ.

@item NPI_version
This indicates the current version of NPI that is supported.

@end smallexample

@subsubheading Parameters

@vtable @var

@item PRIM_type
Is the primitive type.

@item ADDR_length
Is the length in bytes of the network address to be bound to the stream.

@item ADDR_offset
Is the offset from the beginning of the M_PROTO block where the network address
begins.

@item CONIND_number
Is the requested number of connect indications allowed to be outstanding by the
NS provider for the specified protocol address.  (If the number of outstanding
connect indications equals CONIND_number, the NS provider need not discard
further incoming connect indications, but may choose to queue them internally
until the number of outstanding connect indications drops below the
CONIND_number.) Only one stream per network address is allowed to have a
CONIND_number value greater than zero.  This indicates to the network provider
that this stream is the listener stream for the NS user.  This stream will be
used by the NS provider for connect indications for that network address.

If a stream is bound as a listener stream, it will not be able to initiate
connect requests.  If the NS user attempts to send an N_CONN_REQ primitive down
this stream, an N_ERROR_ACK message will be sent to the NS user by the NS
provider with an error value of NACCESS.

@emph{This field should be ignored in CLNS.}

@item PROTOID_length
Is the length in bytes of the protocol ids to be bound to the stream.

@item PROTOID_offset
Is the offset from the beginning of the M_PROTO block where the protocol id
begins.

@end vtable

@subsubheading Flags

@vtable @var

@item DEFAULT_LISTENER

When set, this flag indicates that this stream is the ``default listener
stream''.  This stream is used to pass connect indications for all incoming calls
that contain protocol identifiers that are not bound to any other listener, or
when a listener stream with CONIND_number value of greater than zero is not
found.  Also, the default listener will receive all incoming call indications
that contain no user data.

Only one default listener stream is allowed per occurrence of NPI.  An attempt to
bind a default listener stream when one is already bound should result in an
error (of type NBOUND).

@emph{The DEFAULT_LISTENER flag is ignored in CLNS.}

@item TOKEN_REQUEST
When set, this flag indicates to the NS provider that the NS user has requested
that a ``token'' be assigned to the stream (to be used in the NC response
message), and the token value be returned to the NS user via the N_BIND_ACK
primitive.

The token assigned by the NS provider can then be used by the NS user in a
subsequent N_CONN_RES primitive to identify the stream on which the NC is to be
established.

@emph{The TOKEN_REQUEST flag is ignored in CLNS.}

@item DEFAULT_DEST
When set, this flag indicates that this stream is the ``default destination
stream.'' This stream will receive all packets destined for the NSAP specified
in the bind request.  If no NSAP is indicated in the bind request, then this
stream should receive all packets destined to an NSAP which is bound to no other
stream.

Only one default destination stream per NSAP is allowed per occurrence of NPI.  An
attempt to bind a default destination stream to an NSAP when one is already
bound should result in an error of type NBOUND.

@emph{The DEFAULT_DEST flag is ignored in the CONS.}

@end vtable

@subsubheading Valid States

This primitive is valid in state NS_UNBND (see Appendix B).

@subsubheading New State

The new state is NE_WACK_BREQ.

@subsubheading Acknowledgements

The NS provider will generate one of the following acknowledgements upon receipt
of the N_BIND_REQ primitive:

@itemize ---

@item Successful:
Correct acknowledgement of the primitive is indicated using the N_BIND_ACK
primitive.

@item Non-fatal errors:
These errors will be indicated using the N_ERROR_ACK primitive.  The applicable
non-fatal errors are as follows:

@vtable @asis

@item NBADADDR
The network address was in an incorrect format or the address contained illegal
information.  It is not intended to indicate protocol errors.

@item NBOUND
The NS user attempted to bind a second stream to a network address with the
CONIND_number set to a non-zero value, or attempted to bind a second stream with
the DEFAULT_LISTENER flag value set to non-zero.

@item NNOADDR
The NS provider could not allocate an address.

@item NACCESS
The user did not have proper permissions for the use of the requested address.

@item NOUTSTATE
The primitive was issued from an invalid state.

@item NSYSERR
A system error has occurred and the UNIX system error is indicated in the
primitive.

@item NNOPROTOID
Protocol identifier could not be allocated.

@subsubheading Parameters

@vtable @var

@item PRIM_type
Indicates the primitive type.

@item ADDR_length
Is the length of the network address that was bound.

@item ADDR_offset
Is the offset from the beginning of the M_PCPROTO block where the network
address begins.

@item CONIND_number
Is the accepted number of connect indications allowed to be outstanding by the
NS provider for the specified network address.  If its value is zero, this stream
cannot acceptN_CONN_IND messages.  If its value is greater than zero, then the NS
user can accept N_CONN_IND messages up to the value specified in this parameter
before having to respond with a N_CONN_RES or a N_DISCON_REQ message.

@emph{This field should be ignored for CLNS.}

@item TOKEN_value
Conveys the value of the ``token'' assigned to this stream that can be used by
the NS user in a N_CONN_RES primitive to accept a NC on this stream.  It is a
non-zero value, and is unique to all streams bound to the NS provider.

@emph{This field should be ignored for CLNS.}

@item PROTOID_length
Conveys the length of the protocol ids that were bound.

@item PROTOID_offset
Conveys the offset of the protocol ids that were bound.

@end vtable

The proper alignment of the address in the M_PCPROTO message block is not guaranteed.

@subsubheading Bind Rules:

The following rules apply to the binding of the specified network address to the
stream:

@itemize ---

@item If the ADDR_length field in the N_BIND_REQ primitive is zero, then the NS
provider is to assign a network address to the user.

@item The NS provider is to bind the network address as specified in the
N_BIND_REQ primitive.  If the NS provider cannot bind the specified address, it
may assign another network address to the user.  It is the network user's
responsibility to check the network address returned in the N_BIND_ACK primitive
to see if it is the same as the one requested.

@end itemize

The following rules apply to negotiating CONIND_number argument:

@itemize ---

@item The CONIND_number in the N_BIND_ACK primitive must be less than or equal
to the corresponding requested number as indicated in the N_BIND_REQ primitive.

@item Only one stream that is bound to the indicated network address may have a
negotiated accepted number of maximum connect requests greater than zero.  If a
N_BIND_REQ primitive specifies a value greater than zero, but another stream has
already bound itself to the given network address with a value greater than
zero, the NS provider should assign another protocol address to the user.

@item If a stream with CONIND_number greater than zero is used to accept a
connection,the stream will be found busy during the duration of that connection
and no other streams may be bound to that network address with a CONIND_number
greater than zero.  This will prevent more than one stream bound to the identical
network address from accepting connect indications.

@item A stream requesting a CONIND_number of zero should always be legal.  This
indicates to the NS provider that the stream is to be used to request
connections only.

@item A stream with a negotiated CONIND_number greater than zero may generate
connect requests or accept connect indications.

@end itemize

@emph{If the above rules result in an error condition, then the NS provider must
issue anN_ERROR_ACK primitive to the NS user specifying the error as defined in
the description of the N_BIND_REQ primitive.}

@subsubsection Network Connection Indication

@subsubheading N_CONN_IND
@prindex N_CONN_IND

This primitive indicates to the destination NS user that a network connect
request has been made by the user at the specified source address.

@subsubheading Format

The format of this message is one M_PROTO message block followed by one or
more M_DATA blocks for NS user data.  The specification of NS user data is

@item DEST_length
Indicates the length of the destination address parameter that conveys an address
identifying the NS user to which the NC is to be established.

@item DEST_offset
Is the offset of the destination address from the beginning of theM_PROTO
message block.

@item SRC_length
The source address parameter conveys the network address of the NS user from

@item SEQ_number
Identifies the sequence number that can be used by the NS user to associate this
message with the N_CONN_RES or N_DISCON_REQ primitive that is to follow.  This
value must be unique among the outstanding N_CONN_IND messages.  The use of this
field allows the NS user to issue the N_CONN_RES or the N_DISCON_REQ messages in
any order.

@item QOS_length
Indicates the length of the QOS parameters values that are negotiated during NC
establishment.  If the destination NS user does not agree to the range of QOS
values specified by the source NS user in the N_CONN_REQ primitive, it will
reject the NC establishment by invoking a N_DISCON_REQ primitive(the originator
parameter in the N_DISCON_REQ primitive will indicate NS user initiated
release).  If the NS user does not support or cannot determine the value of a QOS
parameter, its value will be set to QOS_UNKNOWN.  If the NS user does not specify
any QOS parameter values, the length of this field should be set to zero.

@subsubheading Parameters

@vtable @var

@item PRIM_type
Indicates the primitive type.

@item TOKEN_value
Is used to identify the stream that the NS user wants to establish the NC on.
(Its value is determined by the NS user by issuing a N_BIND_REQ primitive with
the TOKEN_REQUEST flag set.The token value is returned in the N_BIND_ACK).  The
value of this field should be non-zero when the NS user wants to establish the NC
on a stream other than the stream on which the N_CONN_IND arrived.  If the NS
user wants to establish a NC on the same stream that the N_CONN_IND arrived on,
then the value of this field should be zero.

@item RES_length
Indicates the length of the responding address parameter that conveys the network
address of the NS user to which the NC has been established.  Under certain
circumstances, such as call redirection, generic addressing, etc., the value of
this parameter may be different from the destination address
parameter specification in the corresponding N_CONN_REQ.

@item RES_offset
Indicates the offset of the responding address from the beginning of the M_PROTO
message block.

@item SEQ_number
Indicates the sequence number of the N_CONN_RES message.It is used by the NS
provider to associate the N_CONN_RES message with an outstanding N_CONN_IND
message.  An invalid sequence number should result in error with the message type
NBADSEQ.

@item QOS_length
Indicates the length of the QOS parameters values that are negotiated during NC
establishment.  If the NS user does not agree to the QOS values, it will reject
the NC establishment by invoking a N_DISCON_REQ primitive (the originator
parameter in the N_DISCON_REQ primitive will indicate NS user invoked release).
If the NS user cannot determine the value of a QOS parameter, its value should
be set to QOS_UNKNOWN.  If the NS user does not specify any QOS parameter values,
the length of this field should be set to zero.

@item QOS_offset
Indicates the offset of the QOS parameters from the beginning of the M_PROTO
message block.

@node N_CONN_CON
@subsubsection Network Connection Confirm

@subheading N_CONN_CON
@prindex N_CONN_CON

This primitive indicates to the source NS user that the network connect request
has been confirmed on the specified responding address.

@subsubheading Format

The format of this message is one M_PROTO message block followed by one or
more M_DATA blocks (for NS user data).  The specification of the NS user data is
optional.

The NS user can send any integral number of octets of NS user data within a
range supported by the NS provider (see N_INFO_ACK).  The NS user data will only
be present if the corresponding N_CONN_RES had NS user data specified with it,
and their data will always be identical.

The structure of the M_PROTO block is as follows:

@smallexample
typedef struct @{
        ulong PRIM_type;                /* always N_CONN_CON */
        ulong RES_length;               /* responding address length */
        ulong RES_offset;               /* responding address offset */
        ulong CONN_flags;               /* bit masking for options flags */
        ulong QOS_length;               /* QOS parameters' length */
        ulong QOS_offset;               /* QOS parameters' offset */
@} N_conn_con_t;
@tpindex N_conn_con_t
@end smallexample

@subsubheading Parameters

@vtable @var

@item PRIM_type
Indicates the primitive type.

@item RES_length
Indicates the length of the responding address parameter that conveys the
network address of the NS user entity to which the NC has been established.  The
semantics of the values in the N_CONN_CON is identical to the values in
N_CONN_RES.  Under certain circumstances, such as call redirection,
generic addressing, etc., the value of this parameter may be different from the
destination address parameter specification in the corresponding N_CONN_REQ.

@item RES_offset
Indicates the offset of the responding address from the beginning of the M_PROTO
message block.

@item QOS_length
Indicates the length of the QOS parameters values selected by the responding NS
user.  If the NS provider does not support or cannot determine the selected value
of a QOS parameter, its value will be set to QOS_UNKNOWN.  If the NS provider does
not specify any QOS parameter values, the length of this field should be set to
zero.

@item QOS_offset
Indicates the offset of the QOS parameters from the beginning of the M_PROTO
message block.

@end vtable

@subsubheading Flags

@vtable @var

@item REC_CONF_OPT
The receipt confirmation selection parameter indicates the use/availability of
the receipt confirmation service on the NC.  The receipt confirmation service must
be provided in the network service to be used on the NC.

@item EX_DATA_OPT
The expedited data selection parameter indicates the use/ availability of the
expedited data transfer service on the NC.  The expedited data transfer service
must be provided by the NS provider for it to be used on the NC.  Valid States
This primitive is valid in state NS_WCON_CREQ.  New State The new state is
NS_DATA_XFER.

@node Normal Data Transfer Phase
@subsection Normal Data Transfer Phase

@menu
* N_DATA_REQ::
* N_DATA_IND::
@end menu

The data transfer service primitives provide for an exchange of NS user data
known as NSDUs, in either direction or in both directions simultaneously on a
NC.  The network service preserves both the sequence and the boundaries of the
NSDUs (when the NS provider supports NSDUs).

@node N_DATA_REQ
@subsubsection Normal Data Transfer Request

@subsubheading N_DATA_REQ
@prindex N_DATA_REQ

This user-originated primitive indicates to the NS provider that this message
contains NS user data.  It allows the transfer of NS_user_data between NS users,
without modification by the NS provider.  The NS user must send any integral
number of octets of data greater than zero.  In a case where the size of the NSDU
exceeds the NIDU (as specified by the size of the NIDU_size parameter of the
N_INFO_ACK primitive), the NSDU may be broken up into more than one NIDU.  When
an NSDU is broken up into more than one NIDU, the N_MORE_DATA_FLAG will be set
on each NIDU except the last one.  The RC_flagmay only be set on the last NIDU.

@subsubheading Format

The format of the message is one or more M_DATA blocks.  Use of a M_PROTOmessage
block is optional.  The M_PROTO message block is used for two reasons:

@enumerate 1

@item to indicate that the NSDU is broken into more than one NIDUs, and that the
data carried in the following M_DATA message block constitutes one NIDU;

@item to indicate whether receipt confirmation is desired for the NSDU.

@end enumerate

@subsubheading Guidelines for use of M_PROTO:

The following guidelines must be followed with respect to the use of the M_PROTO
message block:

@enumerate 1

@item The M_PROTO message block need not be present when the NSDU size is
less than or equal to the NIDU size and one of the following is true:

@itemize ---

@item receipt confirmation has been negotiated for non-use (via the
N_CONNprimitives); or

@item receipt confirmation has been successfully negotiated for use or non-use
and the default selection as specified via the N_OPTMGMT primitive is to be used.

@end itemize

@item The M_PROTO message block must be present when:

@itemize ---

@item the NSDU size is greater than the NIDU size;

@item receipt confirmation has been successfully negotiated for use and the
default selection as specified via N_OPTMGMT_REQ primitive needs to be
overridden.

@end itemize

@end enumerate

The structure of the M_PROTO message block, if present, is as follows:

@smallexample
typedef struct @{
        ulong PRIM_type;                /* always N_DATA_REQ */

@subsubheading Parameters

@vtable @var

@item PRIM_type
Indicates the primitive type.

@end vtable

@subsubheading Flags

@vtable @var

@item N_MORE_DATA_FLAG
When set, the MORE_DATA_FLAG indicates that the next N_DATA_REQ message (NIDU) is
also part of this NSDU.

@item N_RC_FLAG
By setting this flag on the N_DATA_REQ, the originating NS user can request
confirmation of receipt of the N_DATA primitive.  The receipt is provided by the
N_DATACK primitives.  The parameter may only be present if use of Receipt
Confirmation was agreed by both NS users and the NS provider during NC
establishment.

@end vtable

@subsubheading Valid States

This primitive is valid in the NS_DATA_XFER state.

@subsubheading New State

The resulting state remains the same (NS_DATA_XFER).

@subsubheading Acknowledgements

This primitive does not require any acknowledgements, although it may generate
a fatal error.  This is indicated to the NS user via a M_ERROR STREAMS message
type (specifying an errno value of EPROTO) which results in the failure of
all system calls on that stream.  The applicable errors are defined as follows:

@vtable @asis

@item EPROTO
This indicates one of the following unrecoverable protocol conditions:

@itemize ---

@item The network interface was found to be in an incorrect state.

@item The amount of NS user data associated with the primitive is outside the range
supported by the NS provider (as specified by the NIDU_size parameter
ofN_INFO_ACK primitive).

@item The options requested are either not supported by the NS provider or its use
not specified with the N_CONN_REQ primitive.

@item The M_PROTO message block was not followed by one or more M_DATA message
blocks.

@item The amount of NS user data associated with the current NSDU is outside the
range supported by the NS provider (as specified by the NSDU_sizeparameter if
the N_INFO_ACK primitive.)

@item The N_RC_FLAG and N_MORE_DATA_FLAG were both set in the primitive, or the
flags field contained an unknown value.

@end itemize

@end vtable

NOTE: If the interface is in the NS_IDLE or NS_WRES_RIND states when the provider
receives the N_DATA_REQ primitive, then the NS provider should discard the
request without generating a fatal error.


@page
@node N_DATA_IND
@subsubsection Normal Data Transfer Indication

@subsubheading N_DATA_IND
@prindex N_DATA_IND

This network-provider-originated primitive indicates to the NS user that this
message contains NS user data.  As in the N_DATA_REQ primitive, the NSDU can be
segmented into more than one NIDUs.  The NIDUs are associated with the NSDU by
using theMORE_DATA_FLAG.  The RC_FLAG is allowed to be set only on the last NIDU.

@subsubheading Format

The format of the message is one or more M_DATA message blocks.  The value of the
NS user data field is always the same as that supplied in the corresponding
N_DATA_REQ primitive at the peer service access point.  Use of M_PROTO message
blocks is optional (see guidelines under N_DATA_REQ).

The structure of the M_PROTO message block, if present, is as follows:

@vtable @var

@item MORE_DATA_FLAG
When set, indicates that the next N_DATA_IND message (NIDU) is part of this NSDU.

@item RC_FLAG
The value of the parameter may indicate either that confirmation is requested or
that it is not requested.  The parameter is allowed to be set only if use of
Receipt Confirmation was agreed to between both the NS users and the NS provider
during NC establishment.  The value of this parameter is always identical to that
supplied in the corresponding N_DATA_REQ primitive.

@end vtable

@subsubheading Valid States

@page
@node Receipt Confirmation Service Primitives
@subsection Receipt Confirmation Service Primitives

@menu
* N_DATACK_REQ::
* N_DATACK_IND::
@end menu

The receipt confirmation service is requested by the confirmation request
parameter on the N_DATA_REQ primitive.  For each and every NSDU with the
confirmation request parameter set, the receiving NS user should return an
N_DATACK_REQ primitive.Such acknowledgements should be issued in the same
sequence as the corresponding N_DATA_IND primitives are received, and are to be
conveyed by the NS provider in such a way so as to preserve them distinct from
any previous or subsequent acknowledgements.  The NS user may thus correlate them
with the original requests by counting.  When an NSDU has been segmented into
more than one NIDUs, only the last NIDU is allowed to request receipt
confirmation.  N_DATACK_REQ primitives will not be subject to the flow control
affectingN_DATA_REQ primitives at the same NC endpoint.  N_DATACK_IND primitives
will not be subject to the flow control affecting N_DATA_IND primitives at the
same NC endpoint.

The use of the receipt confirmation service must be agreed to by the two NS
users of the NC and the NS provider during the NC establishment by using the
RC_selection parameter on the N_CONN primitives.

@subsubheading Acknowledgements

This primitive does not require any acknowledgements, although it may generate a
fatal (unrecoverable) error.  This is indicated via an M_ERROR STREAMS message
type (issued to the NS user specifying the errno value of EPROTO), which results
in the failure of all system calls on that stream.  The allowable errors are as
follows:

@vtable @asis

@item EPROTO

@itemize ---

@item The network interface was found to be in an incorrect state.

@end itemize

@end vtable

NOTE: If the interface is in the NS_IDLE state when the provider receives
the N_DATACK_REQ primitive, then the NS provider should discard the request
without generating a fatal error.  If the NS provider had no knowledge of a
previous N_DATA_IND with the receipt confirmation flag set, then the NS provider
should just ignore the request without generating a fatal error.

@end menu

The expedited data transfer service provides a further means of information
exchange on an NC in both directions simultaneously.  The transfer of expedited
network service data unit (ENSDU) is subject to separate flow control from that
applying to NS user data (However, a separate STREAMS message type for expedited
data is not available with UNIX(R) System V Release 3.1.  Until a new STREAMS
message type is provided, expedited data will be implemented via queue
manipulation).  The NS provider should guarantee that an expedited-NSDU will not
be delivered after any subsequently issued NSDU or expedited-NSDU on that NC.
The relationship between normal and expedited data is shown in Table 2.
Expedited data can still be delivered when the receiving NS user is not accepting
normal data (however this cannot be guaranteed if there are blockages occurring
in the lower layers).  The expedited data transfer service is a NS provider
option, and its use must be agreed by the two NS users of the NC and the NS
provider during NC establishment by using the EX_DATA_OPT parameter on the
N_CONN primitives.

All loss of data which does not involve loss of the NC is reported in this way.
Invocation of the reset service will unblock the flow of NSDUs and ENSDUs in case
of congestion of the NC; it will cause the NS provider to discard NSDUs, ENSDUs,
or confirmations of receipt associated with the NC (See Table 1), and to notify
any NS user or users that did not invoke reset that a reset has occurred.  The
service will be completed in finite time,irrespective of the acceptance of the

The NC release service primitives are used to release a NC.  The release may
be performed by:

@itemize ---

@item either or both of the NS users to release an established NC;

@item the NS provider to release an established NC (all failures to maintain an

@item by the NS provider to indicate its inability to establish a requested NC.

@end itemize

An NC release is permitted at any time regardless of the current phase of the
NC.  Once an NC release procedure has been invoked, the NC will be released; a
request for release cannot be rejected.  The network service does not guarantee
delivery of any data once the NC release phase is entered (see Table 1).

@node N_DISCON_REQ
@subsubsection Disconnect Request

@subsubheading N_DISCON_REQ
@prindex N_DISCON_REQ

This user-originated primitive requests that the NS provider deny a request for
a network connection, or disconnect an existing connection.

@subsubheading Format

The format of the message is one M_PROTO message block, followed by one or
more M_DATA message blocks (for NS user data).  The NS user data may be lost if
the NS provider initiates release before the N_DISCON_IND is delivered.
Therefore, the NS user data parameter is present only if the originator
parameter (as discussed in N_DISCON_IND definition) indicates that the release
was originated by an NS user.  The NS user may send any integral number of octets
of data within a range supported by the NS provider (see N_INFO_ACK).

The structure of the M_PROTO message block is as follows:

@smallexample
typedef struct @{
        ulong PRIM_type;                /* always N_DISCON_REQ */
        ulong DISCON_reason;            /* reason */
        ulong RES_length;               /* responding address length */
        ulong RES_offset;               /* responding address offset */
        ulong SEQ_number;               /* sequence number */
@} N_discon_req_t;
@tpindex N_discon_req_t
@end smallexample

@subsubheading Parameters

@vtable @var

@item PRIM_type
Indicates the primitive type.

@item DISCON_reason
Gives information about the cause of the release.

@item RES_length
Indicates the length of the address of the responding address parameter.  The
responding address parameter is an optional parameter, and is present in the
primitive only in the case where the primitive is used to indicate rejection of
an NC establishment attempt by an NS user.  The responding address parameter
conveys the network address of the NS user entity from which the N_DISCON_REQ
was issued and under certain circumstances (e.g.  call redirection, generic
addressing, etc.) may be different from the ``destination address'' in
the corresponding N_CONN_REQ primitive.

@item RES_offset
Is the offset from the beginning of the M_PROTO message block where the network
address begins.

@item SEQ_number
When non-zero, it identifies the sequence number of the N_CONN_IND message being
rejected.  This number is used by the NS provider to associate the N_DISCON_REQ
with an unacknowledged N_CONN_IND that is to be rejected.  If the N_DISCON_REQ is
rejecting a NC that is already established(or rejecting a N_CONN_REQ that the NS
user had previously sent and has not yet been confirmed), then this field should
have a value of 0.

@end vtable

@subsubheading Valid States

This primitive is valid in states NS_WCON_CREQ, NS_WRES_CIND,NS_DATA_XFER, NS_WCON_RREQ, NS_WRES_RIND.

@subsubheading New State

The new state depends on the original state (see Appendix B, Table B-8).

@subsubheading Acknowledgements:

The NS provider should generate one of the following acknowledgements upon
receipt of this primitive:

@itemize ---

@item Successful:
Successful completion is indicated via the N_OK_ACK primitive.

@item Unsuccessful (Non-fatal errors):

errors are as follows:

@vtable @asis

@item NOUTSTATE
The primitive was issued from an invalid state.

@item NBADDATA
The amount of user data specified was outside the range supported by the NS
provider.

@item NSYSERR
A system error has occurred and the UNIX system error is indicated in the
primitive.

@item NBADSEQ
The specified sequence number referred to an invalid N_CONN_IND message, or the
N_DISCON_REQ is rejecting an NC that is already established (or rejecting
anN_CONN_REQ that the NS user had previously sent and has not yet been
confirmed) and the value of the sequence number is not 0.

@end vtable

@end itemize

@page
@node N_DISCON_IND
@subsubsection Disconnect Indication

@subsubheading N_DISCON_IND
@prindex N_DISCON_IND

This network-provider originated primitive indicates to the NS user that either
a request for connection has been denied or an existing connection has been
disconnected.

@subsubheading Format

The format of the message is one M_PROTO message block, followed by one or
more M_DATA blocks.  The value of the NS user data parameter is identical to the
value in the corresponding N_DISCON_REQ primitive.  The NS user data parameter is
present only if the originator parameter indicates that the release was
initiated by the NS user.

The structure of the M_PROTO message block is as follows:

@smallexample
typedef struct @{
        ulong PRIM_type;                /* always N_DISCON_IND */
        ulong DISCON_orig;              /* originator */
        ulong DISCON_reason;            /* reason */
        ulong RES_length;               /* responding address length */
        ulong RES_offset;               /* responding address offset */

Indicates the primitive type.

@item DISCON_orig
Indicates the source of the NC release.

@item DISCON_reason
Gives information about the cause of the release.

@item RES_length
Indicates the length of the address of the responding address parameter.  The
responding address parameter is an optional parameter, and is present in the
primitive only in the case where the primitive is used to indicate rejection of
an NC establishment attempt by an NS user.  When not present, the value of this
parameter is zero.  When present, the value of the disconnect address parameter
is identical to that supplied with the corresponding N_DISCON_REQ primitive.

@item RES_offset
Is the offset from the beginning of the M_PROTO message block where the network
address begins.

@item SEQ_number
When its value is non-zero, it identifies the sequence number associated with the
N_CONN_IND that is being aborted.

The value of this parameter must be zero when:

@enumerate a

@item indicating the rejection of a previously issuedN_CONN_REQ primitive; or

@item indicating the release of a NC that is already successfully established.

@end enumerate

When this field is non-zero and its value is the same as the sequence number
assigned to an unacknowledged N_CONN_IND, it indicates that the NS provider is
canceling the unacknowledged N_CONN_IND.

@node Diagnostics Requirements
@chapter Diagnostics Requirements

Two error handling facilities should be provided to the network service user:
one to handle non-fatal errors, and the other to handle fatal errors.

@section Non-Fatal Error Handling Facility

These are errors that do not change the state of the network service interface
as seen by the network service user, and provide the user the option of reissuing
the network service primitive with the corrected options specification.  The
non-fatal error handling is provided only to those primitives that require
acknowledgements, and uses the N_ERROR_ACK to report these errors.  These errors
retain the state of the network service interface the same as it was before the
network provider received the primitive that was in error.  Syntax errors and
rule violations are reported via the non-fatal error handling facility.

@section Fatal Error Handling Facility

These errors are issued by the NS provider when it detects errors that are not
correctable by the network service user, or if it is unable to report a
correctable error to the network service user.  Fatal errors are indicated via
the STREAMS message type M_ERRORwith the UNIX system error EPROTO.  The M_ERROR
STREAMS message type will result in the failure of all the UNIX system calls on
the stream.  The network service user can recover from a fatal error by having all
the processes close the files associated with the stream, and then reopening
them for processing.

addendum must be used along with the generic NPI as defined in the main document
when implementing a NS provider that will be configured with the OSI Transport
Layer.

@section Quality of Service: Model & Description
The ``Quality of Service'' characteristics apply to both CONS as well as CLNS.

@subsection QOS Overview
QOS (Quality of Service) is described in terms of QOS parameters.  There are two
types of QOS parameters:

@enumerate 1

@item Those that are ``negotiated'' on a per-connection basis during NC
establishment.(CLNS does not support end-to-end QOS parameter negotiation).

@item Those that are not negotiated and their values are selected/determined by
local management methods.

@end enumerate

Table 8 summarizes the supported parameters both for connection-mode
and connectionless network service.  For more details on the definition of the
QOS parameters, refer to CCITT X.213 [1] and ISO 8348 [2].

@cartouche
@image{npi_tab8} @center @b{Figure 8.  Supported QoS Parameters}
@end cartouche

@subsection QOS Parameter Formats

This section describes the formats of the QOS parameters for CONS and/or
CLNS services.  The requested QOS parameter values apply to complete NSDUs.

@subsubsection NC Establishment Delay

This parameter applies to CONS only.  It is defined as the maximum acceptable
delay between a N_CONN_REQ and the corresponding N_CONN_CON primitive.  NC
establishment delay is measured in milliseconds.

@subsubheading Format: 

@smallexample
long nc_estab_delay; /* maximum NC establishment delay */
@end smallexample

@vtable @var

@item nc_estab_delay
Is the maximum acceptable delay value for NC establishment.

@end vtable

@subsubsection NC Establishment Failure Probability

This parameter applies to CONS only.  NC Establishment Failure Probability is
the percent ratio (rounded to the nearest integer) of total NC establishment
failures to total NC establishment attempts in a measurement sample.  A
measurement sample consists of100 NC establishment attempts.

NC establishment failure occurs due to NS provider behaviour such as
mis-connection, NC refusal, and excessive delay.  NC establishment attempts that
fail due to NS user behaviour such as error, NC refusal, or excessive delay are
excluded in calculating NC establishment failure probability.

@subsubheading Format:

@smallexample
long nc_estab_fail_prob; /* maximum NC estab failure probability */
@end smallexample

@vtable @var

@item nc_estab_fail_prob
Is the maximum acceptable percent value (rounded to the nearest integer) for the
NC establishment failure probability.

@end vtable

@subsubsection Throughput

This parameter applies to CONS only, is specified separately for each direction
of transfer, and has end-to-end significance.  Throughput is defined in terms of
at least two successfully transferred NSDUs presented continuously to the NS
provider at the maximum rate the NS provider can continuously sustain, and
unconstrained by flow control applied by the receiving NS user.  Given a sequence
of ``n'' NSDUs (where is greater than or equal to two; suggested value is 100),
throughput is defined to be the smaller of:

@enumerate a

@item the number of NS user data octets contained in the last ``n-1'' NSDUs
divided bythe time between the first and the last N_DATA_REQs in the sequence;
and

@item the number of NS user data octets contained in the last ``n-1'' NSDUs
divided bythe time between the first and the last N_DATA_INDs in the sequence.

@end enumerate

Throughput should be measured and specified in bits per second.

@subsubheading Format:

@smallexample
typedef struct @{
        long thru_targ_value;
        long thru_min_value;
@} thru_values_t;
@tpindex thru_values_t
@end smallexample

@vtable @var

@item thru_targ_value
Specifies the requested QOS value for throughput for data transfer between the
two NS users.

@item thru_min_value
Specifies the requested lowest acceptable QOS value for throughput between the
two NS users.

@end vtable

@subsubsection Transit Delay

This parameter applies to CONS as well as CLNS.  Transit Delay is the elapsed
time between a N_DATA_REQ and the corresponding N_DATA_IND (calculated on
successfully transferred NSDUs only).  The pair of values specified for an NC
applies to both directions of transfer.  The specified values are averages (based
on 100 samples using a NSDU size of 128 bytes).  Transit Delay should be measured
in milliseconds.

@subsubheading Format:

@smallexample
typedef struct @{
        long td_targ_value;
        long td_max_value;
@} td_values_t;
@tpindex td_values_t
@end smallexample

@vtable @var

@item td_targ_value
Specifies the desired QOS value for transit delay between the two NS users.

@item td_max_value
Specifies the maximum QOS value that the source NS user will agree for transit
delay between the two NS users.

@end vtable

@subsubsection Residual Error Rate

This parameter applies to both CONS as well as CLNS.  Residual Error Rate is
the percent ratio (rounded to the nearest integer) of total incorrect, lost, and
duplicate NSDUs to total NSDUs transferred across the NS boundary during a
measurement period.  The measurement period will be 3600 seconds.

@subsubheading Format:

@smallexample
long residual_error_rate; /* maximum acceptable residual error rate */
@end smallexample

@vtable @var

@item residual_error_rate
Specifies the maximum acceptable percent value (rounded to the nearest integer)
of the residual error rate.

@end vtable

@subsubsection NC Resilience

This parameter applies to CONS only.  NC Resilience specifies the percent
probability (rounded to the nearest integer) of a NS provider invoked NC release
or a NS provider invoked reset during a specified time interval on an
established NC.  The time interval will be 3600 seconds.

@subsubheading Format:

@smallexample
long nc_resilience; /* maximum acceptable nc resilience */
@end smallexample

@vtable @var

@item nc_resilience
Specifies the maximum acceptable value for NC resilience.

@end vtable

@subsubsection Transfer Failure Probability

This parameter applies to CONS only.  It is the percent ratio (rounded to the
nearest integer) of total transfer failures to total transfer samples observed
during a performance measurement.  A transfer sample is a discrete observation of
NS provider performance in transferring NSDUs between specified sending and
receiving NS user.  A transfer sample will last for the duration of the NC.  A
transfer failure is a transfer sample in which the observed performance is worse
than the specified minimum acceptable level.  A transfer failure is identified by
comparing the measured values for the supported performance parameters with
specified transfer failure thresholds.  The three supported performance
parameters are throughput, transit delay, and residual error rate.

@subsubheading Format:

@smallexample
long xfer_fail_prob; /* maximum xfer failure prob */
@end smallexample

@vtable @var

@item xfer_fail_prob
Specifies the maximum acceptable percent value (rounded to the nearest integer)
for transfer failure probability.

@end vtable

@subsubsection NC Release Delay

This parameter applies to CONS only.  NC Release Delay is defined as the
maximum acceptable delay between a NS user invoked N_DISCON_REQ and the
successful release of the NC at the peer NS user.  NC Release Delay is specified
independently for each NS user.  It does not apply in cases where NC release is
invoked by the NS provider.  NC release delay should be measured in milliseconds.

@subsubheading Format:

@smallexample
long nc_rel_delay; /* maximum nc release delay */
@end smallexample

@vtable @var

@item nc_rel_delay
Is the maximum acceptable value for NC release delay.

@end vtable

@subsubsection NC Release Failure Probability

This parameter applies to CONS only.  It is the percent ratio (rounded to the
nearest integer) of total NC release requests resulting in release failure to
total NC release requests included in a measurement sample.  A measurement sample
consists of a 100NC release requests.  This parameter is specified independently
for each NS user.

A release failure is defined to occur for a particular NS user, if that user
does not receive a N_DISCON_IND within a specified maximum NC release delay of
the NS user issuing the N_DISCON_REQ (given that the former NS user has not
issued aN_DISCON_REQ).

@subsubheading Format:

@smallexample
long nc_rel_fail_prob; /* maximum nc rel fail probability */
@end smallexample

@vtable @var

@item nc_rel_fail_prob
Is the maximum acceptable percent value (rounded to the nearest integer) of NC
release failure probability.

@end vtable

@subsubsection Protection

This parameter applies to both CONS and CLNS.  It specifies the extent to which
the NS provider attempts to prevent unauthorized monitoring or manipulation of NS
user originated information.

@smallexample
/* Types of protection */
#define N_NO_PROT               0x00000000L     /* no protection */
#define N_PASSIVE_PROT          0x00000001L     /* protection against passive
                                                   monitoring */
#define N_ACTIVE_PROT           0x00000002L     /* protection against active
                                                   monitoring */
#define N_ACTIVE_PASSIVE_PROT   0x00000003L     /* maximum protection */
@end smallexample

Four protection options are provided:

@enumerate 1

@item No protection features;

@item Protection against passive monitoring;

@item Protection against modification, replay, addition, or deletion

@item Both 2 and 3.

@end enumerate

@subsubheading Format:

@smallexample
typedef struct @{
        long protect_targ_value;        /* target protection */
        long protect_min_value;         /* minimum protection */
@} protection_values_t;
@tpindex protection_values_t
@end smallexample

@vtable @var

@item protect_targ_value
Specifies the target protection of the NS user originated information.

@item protect_min_value
Specifies the lowest quality acceptable of protection of the NS user originated
information.

@end vtable

@subsubsection Priority

This parameter applies to both CONS and CLNS.

It specifies the target priority of:

@enumerate a

@item an NSDU in relation to any other NSDUs (for CLNS);

@item a NC (for CONS).  The number of priority levels is limited to 15 (where
level 1 is the highest priority and level 15 is the lowest priority).

@end enumerate

@subsubheading Format:

@smallexample
typedef struct @{
        long priority_targ_value;       /* target priority */
        long priority_min_value;        /* minimum priority */
@} priority_values_t;
@tpindex priority_values_t
@end smallexample

@vtable @var

@item priority_targ_value
Specifies the target NC priority level.

@item priority_min_value
Specifies the lowest quality acceptable of the NC priority level.

@end vtable

@subsubsection Maximum Acceptable Cost

This parameter applies to both CONS and CLNS.  It specifies the maximum
acceptable cost in local currency (composed of communications and end-system
resource costs), or indicates to the NS provider that it should choose the least
expensive means available to it.

@subsubheading Format

@smallexample
long max_accept_cost;                   /* acceptable cost maximum */

/* Choose least expensive means */
#define N_LEAST_EXPENSIVE 0x00000000L   /* choose least expensive means */
@end smallexample

@vtable @var

@item max_accept_cost
Specifies the maximum acceptable cost in local currency.

@end vtable

@subsection QOS Data Structures

The quality of services parameters are organized into six different structures
for simplicity:

@vtable @var

@item N_QOS_CO_RANGE1

Quality of service range requested for connection-mode service as used with the
N_CONN_REQ and N_CONN_IND primitives.

@item N_QOS_CO_SEL1

Quality of service values selected for the connection-mode service as used with
the N_CONN_RES and N_CONN_CON primitives.

@item N_QOS_CL_RANGE1

Range of quality of service values for connectionless-mode service as
specified with the QOS_@-range_@-length and QOS_@-range_@-offset parameters of
the N_@-INFO_@-ACK primitive.

@item N_QOS_CL_SEL1

Quality of service values supported/selected for connectionless-mode service as
specified with the QOS_length and QOS_offset parameters of the N_INFO_ACK and
the N_OPTMGMT_REQ primitives.

@item N_QOS_CO_OPT_RANGE1

Range of quality of service values for connection-mode service as specified with
the QOS_range_length and QOS_range_offset parameters of the N_INFO_ACK
primitive.

@item N_QOS_CO_OPT_SEL1

Default quality of service values supported/selected for connection-mode service
as specified with the QOS_length and QOS_offset parameters of the N_INFO_ACK and
the N_OPTMGMT_REQ primitives.

@end vtable

@subsubsection Structure N_QOS_CO_RANGE1
@vrindex N_QOS_CO_RANGE1

Structure N_qos_co_range1 defines the QOS parameters that are transferred
between the source and destination NS users for a NC.  The format of this
structure is as follows:

@smallexample
typedef struct @{
        ulong n_qos_type;               /* always N_QOS_CO_RANGE */
        thru_values_t src_throughput_range;     /* source throughput range */
        thru_values_t dest_throughput_range;    /* dest throughput range */
        td_values_t transit_delay_range;        /* transit delay range */
        protection_values_t protection_range;   /* protection range */
        priority_values_t priority_range;       /* priority target */
@} N_qos_co_range1_t;
@tpindex N_qos_co_range1_t

@section NPI Primitives Rules for OSI Conformance

The following are the rules that apply to the NPI primitives for OSI
compatibility.

@subsection Local Management Primitives

@subsubsection N_INFO_ACK
@prindex N_INFO_ACK

@subsubheading Parameters

@vtable @var

@item NSDU_size
A value greater than zero specifies the maximum size of a Network Service Data
Unit (NSDU); a value of 0 specifies that the transfer of normal data is not
supported by the NS provider,and a value of -1 specifies that there is no limit
on the size of a NSDU.

@item ENSDU_size
A value between 1 and 32 inclusive specifies the maximum size of an Expedited
Network Service Data Unit (ENSDU); a value of 0 specifies that the transfer of
expedited data is not supported by the NS provider.

@item CDATA_size
A value between 1 and 128 inclusive specifies the maximum number of octets of
data that may be associated with connection establishment primitives.  A value of
0 specifies that the NS provider does not allow data to be sent with connection
establishment primitives.  When used in an OSI conforming environment, CDATA_size
shall always equal 128.

@item DDATA_size
A value between 1 and 128 inclusive specifies the maximum number of octets of
data that may be associated with the disconnect primitives; a value of 0
specifies that the NS provider does not allow data to be sent with the
disconnect primitives.  When used in an OSI conforming environment, DDATA_size
shall always equal 128.

@item ADDR_size
A value between 1 and 40 indicates the maximum size of a network address in
decimal digits.  When used in an OSI conforming environment, ADDR_size
shall always equal 40 in order to accommodate a full NSAP address.

@item QOS_length
Indicates the length in bytes of the default/negotiated/selected values of the
QOS parameters.  The applicable QOS parameters are defined in the following
structures:

@enumerate a

@item N_QOS_CO_OPT_SEL1 for CONS; and

@item N_QOS_CL_SEL1 for CLNS.

@end enumerate

In the connection-mode environment, when this primitive is invoked before the NC
is established on the stream, the values returned specify the the default values
supported by the NS provider.  When this primitive is invoked after a NC has been
established on the stream, the values returned indicate the negotiated values
for the QOS parameters.  In the connectionless environment, these values
represent the default or the selected QOS parameter values.

In case a QOS parameter is not supported by the NS Provider, a value of
QOS_UNKNOWN will be returned.  In the case where no QOS parameters are supported
by the NS provider, the length of this field will be zero.

@item QOS_range_length
Indicates the length in bytes, of the available range of QOS parameters values
supported by the NS provider.  These ranges are used by the NS user to select QOS
parameter values that are valid with the NS provider.

The applicable QOS parameters are defined in the following structures:

@enumerate a

@item N_QOS_CO_OPT_RANGE1 for CONS; and

@item N_QOS_CL_RANGE1 for CLNS.

@end enumerate

QOS parameter values are selected, or the default values altered via the
N_OPTMGMT_REQ primitive.  In the connection-mode environment, the values for
end-to-end QOS parameters may be specified with the N_CONN primitives for
negotiation.  If the NS provider does not support a certain QOS parameter, its
value will be set to QOS_UNKNOWN.  In the case where no QOS parameters are
supported by the NS provider, the length of this field will be zero.

@item NIDU_size
This indicates the amount of user data that may be present in aN_DATA primitive.
The NIDU_size should not be larger than the NSDU_size specification.

@item SERV_type
Specifies the service type supported by the NS provider.  The possible values can
be N_CONS, N_CLNS, (or both by using N_CONS|N_CLNS).  If the SERV_type is N_CLNS,
the following rules will apply:

@itemize ---

@item The ENSDU_size, CDATA_size, DDATA_size, and DEFAULT_rc_sel fields are not
used and their values should be set to 0;

@item The NSDU_size should be the same as the NIDU_size.

@end itemize

@item NODU_size
The NODU_size specifies the optimal NSDU size in octets of an NSDU given the
current routing information.

@item PROTOID_length
The length of the protocol identifiers to be bound.

@item PROTOID_offset
The offset of the protocol identifiers to be bound, from the beginning of the
block.

@end vtable

@subsubsection N_OPTMGMT_REQ
@prindex N_OPTMGMT_REQ

@subsubheading Parameters

@vtable @var

@item QOS_length
Indicates the length of the default values of the QOS parameters as selected by
the NS user.  In the connection-mode environment these values will be used in
subsequent N_CONN_REQ primitives on the stream that do not specify values for
these QOS parameters.  In the connection-less environment, these values represent
the selected QOS values that would apply to each unit data transmission.  The
applicable QOS parameters are defined in the following structures:

@enumerate a

@item N_QOS_CO_OPT_SEL1 for CONS; and

@item N_QOS_CL_SEL1 for CLNS.

@end enumerate

If the NS user cannot determine the value of a QOS parameter,its value should be
set to QOS_UNKNOWN.  If the NS user does not specify any QOS parameter values,
the length of this field should be set to zero.

@end vtable

@subsection CONS Connection Establishment Phase Rules for QOS Parameter Negotiation

The negotiation for NC throughput and NC transit-delay QOS parameters
are conducted as follows:

@enumerate a

@item in the N_CONN_REQ primitive, the source NS user specifies two values
for each negotiable QOS parameter:

@enumerate 1

@item a ``target'' which is the QOS value desired; and

@item a ``lowest acceptable'' QOS value to which the source NS user will agree;

@end enumerate

The value of each of these parameters must be within the limit of the allowable
values defined for the network service.  ``Default'' values for these parameters
are supported by the NS provider.  The default values may be selected by the NS
user via the N_OPTMGMT_REQ primitive.

@item if the NS provider agrees to provide a value of QOS which is in the
range between the ``target'' and the ``lowest acceptable'' QOS values, inclusive,
of the N_CONN_REQ, then the NS provider specifies two parameters in
the N_CONN_IND issued to the destination NS user:

@enumerate 1

@item an ``available'' value which is the QOS value the NS provider is willing
to provide; and

@item a ``lowest acceptable'' QOS value which is identical to the
``lowest acceptable'' value specified in the N_CONN_REQ; (if the NS provider
does not agree to provide QOS in the given range, then the NC establishment
request is rejected);

@end enumerate

@item if the destination NS user agrees to a QOS value which is in the range
between the ``available'' and the ``lowest acceptable'' QOS values, inclusive,
of the N_CONN_IND, then the destination NS user specifies a single parameter,
``selected'' in the N_CONN_RES; this parameter is the QOS value the destination
NS user agrees to; (if the destination NS user does not agree to a QOS in the
given range, then the NC establishment request is rejected);

@item the NS provider adopts the QOS value for the NC which was specified by
the destination NS user and supplies this as a single parameter, ``selected'', in
the N_CONN_CON primitive.

@end enumerate

@itemize @bullet

@item The negotiation for the NC protection parameter is conducted as follows:

@enumerate a

@item In the N_CONN_REQ primitive, the calling NS user specifies values for
the ``Target'' and ``Lowest Quality Acceptable'' sub-parameters; permitted value
assignments are:

@table @asis

@item Case1:
both the ``Target'' and ``Lowest Quality Acceptable'' are ``unspecified'';

@item Case2:
values other than ``unspecified'' are specified for both ``Target'' and ``Lowest
Quality Acceptable'';

@item Case3:
a value other than ``unspecified'' is specified for ``Target'' and the ``Lowest
Quality Acceptable'' is ``unspecified''.

@end table

NOTE: In case where ``Target'' is ``unspecified'', the ``Lowest Quality
Acceptable'' must also be ``unspecified''.

@item If the NS provider does not support a choice of NC protection levels, the
value of the ``Target'' parameter is conveyed by the NS provider and passed to
the called NS user unchanged as the ``Available'' sub-parameter in the N_CONN_IND
primitive;

@item If the NS provider does support a choice of NC protection levels, then:

@enumerate 1

@item In Case1, the NS provider determines the QOS value to be offered on the NC
and specifies it in the ``Available'' sub-parameter in the N_CONN_IND primitive;

@item In Case2 and Case3, if the NS provider does not agree to provide a QOS in
the requested range, then the NC establishment attempt is rejected as described
in clause 13.5 of ISO 8348.  If the NS provider does agree to provide a QOS in
the requested range, then in the N_CONN_IND primitive, the ``Available''
sub-parameter specifies the highest QOS value within the range which the NS
provider is willing to provide.

@end enumerate

@item The value of the ``Lowest Quality Acceptable'' sub-parameter in
the N_CONN_IND primitive is identical to that in the N_CONN_REQ primitive;

@item If the value of the ``Available'' sub-parameter of the N_CONN_IND primitive
is ``unspecified'' then:

@enumerate 1

@item if the called NS user does not agree to accept establishment of a NC
with this unspecified quality, the NS user rejects the NC establishment attempt
as described in clause 13.4 of ISO 8348;

@item if the called NS user does agree, then the NS user specifies the
value ``unspecified'' in the ``Selected'' sub-parameter of the N_CONN_RES
primitive.

@end enumerate

@item If the value of the ``Available'' sub-parameter in the N_CONN_IND primitive
is not ``unspecified'' then:

@enumerate 1

@item if the called NS user does not agree to a QOS in the range identified
by the ``Available'' and ``Lowest Quality Acceptable'' sub-parameters of the
N_CONN_IND primitive, then the NS user rejects the NC establishment attempt as
described in clause 13.4 of ISO 8348;

@item if the called NS user does agree to a QOS in the identified range, then
the NS user specifies the agreed value in the ``Selected'' sub-parameter of the
N_CONN_RES primitive.

@end enumerate

@item In the N_CONN_CON primitive, the ``Selected'' sub-parameter has a
value identical to that of ``Selected'' in the N_CONN_RES primitive.

@end enumerate

@item The negotiation of the NC priority parameter is conducted as follows:

@enumerate a

@item In the N_CONN_REQ primitive, the calling NS user specifies values for
the ``Target'' and ``Lowest Quality Acceptable'' sub-parameters; permitted value
assignments are:

@table @asis

@item Case1:
both the ``Target'' and ``Lowest Quality Acceptable'' are ``unspecified'';

@item Case2:
values other than ``unspecified'' are specified for both ``Target'' and ``Lowest
Quality Acceptable'';

@item Case3:
a value other than ``unspecified'' is specified for ``Target'' and the ``Lowest
Quality Acceptable'' is ``unspecified''.

@end table

NOTE: In case where ``Target'' is ``unspecified'', the ``Lowest Quality
Acceptable'' must also be ``unspecified''.

@item If the NS provider does not support a choice of NC priority levels, the
value of the ``Target'' parameter is conveyed by the NS provider and passed to
the called NS user unchanged as the ``Available'' sub-parameter in the
N_CONN_IND primitive;

@item If the NS provider does support a choice of NC priority levels, then:

@enumerate 1

@item In Case1, the NS provider determines the QOS value to be offered on the NC and
specifies it in the ``Available'' sub-parameter in the N_CONN_IND primitive;

@item In Case2 and Case3, if the NS provider does not agree to provide a QOS in the
requested range, then the NC establishment attempt is rejected as described in
clause 13.5 of ISO 8348.  If the NS provider does agree to provide a QOS in the
requested range, then in the N_CONN_IND primitive, the ``Available''
sub-parameter specifies the highest QOS value within the range which the NS
provider is willing to provide.

@end enumerate

@item The value of the ``Lowest Quality Acceptable'' sub-parameter in
the N_CONN_IND primitive is identical to that in the N_CONN_REQ primitive;

@item If the value of the ``Available'' sub-parameter of the N_CONN_IND primitive
is ``unspecified'' then:

@enumerate 1

@item if the called NS user does not agree to accept establishment of a NC with this
unspecified quality, the NS user rejects the NC establishment attempt as
described in clause 13.4 of ISO 8348;

@item if the called NS user does agree, then the NS user specifies the
value ``unspecified'' in the ``Selected'' sub-parameter of the N_CONN_RES
primitive.

@end enumerate

@item If the value of the ``Available'' sub-parameter in the N_CONN_IND primitive
is not ``unspecified'' then:

@enumerate 1

@item if the called NS user does not agree to a QOS in the range identified by
the ``Available'' and ``Lowest Quality Acceptable'' sub-parameters of the
N_CONN_IND primitive, then the NS user rejects the NC establishment attempt as
described in clause 13.4 of ISO 8348;

@item if the called NS user does agree to a QOS in the identified range, then
the NS user specifies the agreed value in the ``Selected'' sub-parameter of the
N_CONN_RES primitive.

@end enumerate

@item In the N_CONN_CON primitive, the ``Selected'' sub-parameter has a
value identical to that of ``Selected'' in the N_CONN_RES primitive.

@end enumerate

@end itemize

@subsubheading Rules for QOS Parameter Selection

When a NS user/provider cannot determine the value of a QOS field, it should
return a value of QOS_UNKNOWN.

@smallexample
#define QOS_UNKNOWN -1
@end smallexample

@subsubheading Rules for Receipt Confirmation Selection

@itemize @bullet

@item The receipt confirmation selection parameter values on the various
primitives are related such that:

@enumerate 1

@item on the N_CONN_REQ, either of the defined values may occur (namely, ``use of
receipt confirmation'', or ``no use of receipt confirmation'').

@item on the N_CONN_IND, the value is either equal to the value on the
request primitive, or is ``no use of receipt confirmation''.

@item on the N_CONN_RES, the value is either equal to the value on the indication
primitive or is ``no use of receipt confirmation''.

@item on the N_CONN_CON, the value is equal to the value on the response primitive.

@end enumerate

@item Since the NS users and the NS provider must agree to the use of receipt
confirmation selection, there are four possible cases of negotiation of receipt
confirmation on an NC:

@enumerate 1

@item if the source NS user does not request it --- it is not used;

@item if the source NS user requests it but the NS provider does not provide it ---
it is not used;

@item if the source NS user requests it and the NS provider agrees to provide
it,but the destination NS user does not agree to its use -- it is not used;

@item if the source NS user requests it, the NS provider agrees to provide it,
and the destination NS user agrees to its use -- it can be used.  Rules for
Expedited Data Selection

@end enumerate

@item The expedited data selection parameter values on the various primitives
are related such that:

@enumerate 1

@item on the N_CONN_REQ, either of the defined values may occur, (namely ``use of
expedited data'' or ``no use of expedited data'');

@item on the N_CONN_IND, the value is either equal to the value on the
request primitive, or is ``no use of expedited data'';

@item on the N_CONN_RES, the value is either equal to the value on the
indication primitive, or is ``no use of expedited data'';

@item on the N_CONN_CON, the value is equal to the value on the response
primitive.

@end enumerate

@item Since the NS users and the NS provider must agree to the use of expedited
data selection, there are four possible cases of negotiation of expedited data on
an NC:

@enumerate 1

@item if the source NS user does not request it --- it is not used;

@item if the source NS user requests it but the NS provider does not provide it
--- it is not used;

@item if the source NS user requests it and the NS provider agrees to provide
it, but the destination NS user does not agree to its use --- it is not used;

@item if the source NS user requests it, the NS provider agrees to provide it,
and the destination NS user agrees to its use --- it can be used.

Indicates the length of the QOS parameters values selected by the responding NS
user.  The applicable QOS parameters are defined in the following structure:

@enumerate a

@item N_QOS_CO_SEL1

@end enumerate

If the NS provider does not support or cannot determine the selected value of a
QOS parameter, its value will be set to QOS_UNKNOWN.  If the NS provider does not
specify any QOS parameter values, the length of this field should be set to
zero.

@vtable @var

@item REC_CONF_OPT
The receipt confirmation selection parameter indicates whether the receipt
confirmation service can be used on the NC.  The receipt confirmation service
must be provided in the network service to be used on the NC.  When set, it
indicates ``use of receipt confirmation'', and when not set it indicates ``no
use of receipt confirmation''.  The value on the N_CONN_CON is equal to the value
on the response primitive.

@item EX_DATA_OPT
The expedited data selection parameter indicates whether the expedited data
transfer service can be used on the NC.  The expedited data transfer service must
be provided by the NS provider for it to be used on the NC.  When set, it
indicates ``use of expedited data'', and when not set, it indicates ``no use of
expedited data''.  The value on the N_CONN_CON is equal to the value on the
response primitive.

@node State/Event Tables
@appendix State/Event Tables

This appendix contains tables showing the network-user's view of the possible
states that the NPI may enter due to an event, and the possible events that may
occur on the interface.  The N_INFO_REQ, N_INFO_ACK, N_TOKEN_REQ, and N_TOKEN_ACK
primitives are excluded from the state transition table because they can be
issued from several states, and secondly, they do not cause a state transition
to occur.  However, the N_INFO_REQ and the N_TOKEN_REQ primitives may not be
issued by the NS user when a local acknowledgement to a previously issued
primitive is pending.

@cartouche
@image{npi_tabb1} @center @b{Table B-1.  Kernel Level NPI States}

Tables B-2 and B-3 describe the variables and outputs used in the state tables.

@end cartouche

Table B-4 shows outgoing events that are initiated by the network-user entity.
These events are either requests to the network provider or responses to an
event of the network provider.

@cartouche
@image{npi_tabb4} @center @b{Table B-4.  Kernel Level NPI Outgoing Events}
@end cartouche

Table B-5 shows incoming events that are initiated by the network provider.
These events are either confirmations of a request, or are indications to the NS
user entity that an event has occurred.

@cartouche
@image{npi_tabb5} @center @b{Table B-5.  Kernel Level NPI Incoming Events}
@end cartouche

Tables B-6 and B-7 describe the possible events the NPI may enter given a
current state and event.  The contents of each box represent the next state given
the current state (column) and the current incoming or outgoing event (row).  An
empty box represents a state/event combination that is invalid.  Along with the
next state, each box may include an action.  The network provider must take
specific actions in the order specified in the state table.

Tables C-1 and C-2 describe the precedence of the NPI primitives for both the
stream write and read queues.  In both these tables, primitive Y is already on the
queue and primitive X is about to be put on the queue.  The stream write queue
contains network user initiated primitives and the stream read queue contains
network provider initiated primitives.  The column headings are a shorthand
notation for the row headings.

@table @emph
@item Signalling Data Link Service Data Unit
A grouping of SDL user data whose boundaries are preserved from one end of the
signalling data link connection to the other.
@item Data transfer
The phase in connection and connectionless modes that supports the transfer of
data between to signalling data link users.
@item SDL provider
The signalling data link layer protocol that provides the services of the
signalling data link interface.
@item SDL user
The user-level application or user-level or kernel-level protocol that accesses
the services of the signalling data link layer.
@item Local management
The phase in connection and connectionless modes in which a SDL user initializes
a stream and attaches a PPA address to the stream.  Primitives in this phase
generate local operations only.
@item PPA
The point at which a system attaches itself to a physical communications medium.
@item PPA identifier
An identifier of a particular physical medium over which communication
transpires.
