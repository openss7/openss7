@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction
@cpindex STREAMS

This document specifies a @cite{STREAMS}-based kernel-level instantiation of the ITU-T
@value{MANUAL_TITLE} definition.  The @value{MANUAL_TITLE} enables the user of a call control
service to access and use any of a variety of conforming call control service providers without
specific knowledge of the provider's protocol.  The service interface is designed to support any
network call control protocol and user call control protocol.  This interface only specifies access
to call control service providers, and does not address issues concerning call control and circuit
management, protocol performance, and performance analysis tools.

This specification assumes that the reader is familiar with ITU-T state machines
and call control interfaces (e.g., Q.764, Q.931), and @cite{STREAMS}.

@node The Call Control Layer
@chapter The Call Control Layer

@menu
* Model of the CCI::
* CCI Services::
@end menu

The Call Control Layer provides the means to manage the connection and disconnection of calls.  It
is responsible for the routing and management of call control signalling between call control-user
entities.

@node Model of the CCI
@section Model of the CCI
@cpindex STREAMS

The CCI defines the services provided by the call control layer to the call control-user at the
boundary between the call control provider and the call control user entity.  The interface consists
of a set of primitives defined as @cite{STREAMS} messages that provide access to the call control
layer services, and are transferred between the CCS user entity and the CCS provider.  These
primitives are of two types; ones that originate from the CCS user, and others that originate from
the CCS provider.  The primitives that originate from the CCS user make requests to the CCS
provider, or respond to an indication of an event of the CCS provider.  The primitives that
originate from the CCS provider are either confirmations of a request or are indications to the CCS
user that an event has occurred.  @figref{1} shows the model of the CCI.

@figuresized{cci01,1,Model of the CCI,4.0in}

The CCI allows the CCS provider to be configured with any call control layer user (such as an ISDN
user call control application) that also conforms to the CCI.  A call control layer user can also be
a user program that conforms to the CCI and accesses the CCS provider via @manref{putmsg(2s)} and
@manref{getmsg(2s)} system calls.

@node CCI Services
@section CCI Services

The features of the CCI are defined in terms of the services provided by the CCS provider, and the
individual primitives that may flow between the CCS user and the CCS provider.

The services supported by the CCI are based on three distinct modes of communication, user-network
interface (UNI) User mode, user-network interface (UNI) Network mode, and network-network interface
(NNI).  In addition, the CCI supports services for local management.

@subsection UNI

The main features of the User-Network Interface mode of communication are:

@enumerate
@item It is call oriented.
@item It employs facility associated signalling in that the signalling interface and circuits that
are controlled by that signalling interface are bound by physical configuration.  (For example,
23B+D, 2B+D).
@item The protocol has two aspects to the interface: one side of the interface follows the User
protocol whereas the other side of the interface follows the Network protocol.
@item The user side of the protocol has no formal maintenance or monitoring procedures and therefore
reports most if not all system events to the user.
@item The network side of the protocol has formal maintenance and monitoring procedures and
therefore reports most if not all system events to maintenance.
@end enumerate

@node Address Formats
@subsubsection Address Formats

Addresses specifying all the calls and channels known to the provider are specified with scope @pval{ISDN_SCOPE_DF} and
identifier zero (0).
@pvindex ISDN_SCOPE_DF

@subsubheading Customer/Provider Group

A customer/provider group has a different interpretation on the User and Network side of the call
control interface.  In User mode, the provider group is a group of all equipment groups that are
serviced by the same network provider.  In Network mode, the customer group is a group of all
equipment groups to which the same service is provided to the same customer by the network.

Customer/provider groups are identifier using a unique customer/provider group identifier within the
CCS provider.  Addresses specifying all of the equipment groups in a customer/provider group and
specified with scope @pval{ISDN_SCOPE_XG} and the customer/provider group identifier. 
@pvindex ISDN_SCOPE_XG

@subsubheading Equipment Group

An equipment group is a group of all transmission groups (B- and D-channels) terminating at the same
location.  For User mode this corresponds to all the B- and D-channels terminating on the same
network provider exchange.  For Network mode this corresponds to all the B- and D-channels
terminating on the same customer site.

Equipment groups are identified using a unique equipment group identifier within the CCS provider.
Addresses specifying all of the B- and D-channels making up an equipment group are specified with
scope @pval{ISDN_SCOPE_EG} and the equipment group identifier.
@pvindex ISDN_SCOPE_EG

@subsubheading Facility Group

A facility group is a group of D-channels (data links) controlling a set of B-channels.  This
corresponds to the signalling interface.  For regular interfaces, a signalling relation consists of
a single signalling interface.  Where multiple signalling interfaces are used to control the same
range of channels (e.g. primary and backup interfaces), all signalling interfaces belong to the same
facility group.

The B-channels that make up a facility group are channels that share the same dial plan and routing
characteristics for telephone calls.  A facility group is associated with an equipment group.

Facility groups are identified using a unique facility group identifier within the CCS provider.
Addresses specifying all of the channels in a facility group are specified with scope
@pval{ISDN_SCOPE_FG} and the facility group identifier.
@pvindex ISDN_SCOPE_FG

An ISDN Channel Identifier is only unique within a facility group.

@subsubheading Transmission Group

A transmission group is the group of all D- and B-Channels associated with a given Q.931 signalling
interface.  For example, a typical PRI interface would consist of 23B+D, where there is one
signalling interface (the D-Channel) with 23 B-Channels associated with the D-Channel.  The 1
D-Channel and 23 B-Channels form a single transmission group associated with the physical interface.
Every D- or B-Channel belongs to one transmission group and occupies a single time slot within that
transmission group.

Transmission groups are identified using a unique transmission group identifier within the CCS
provider.  Addresses specifying all of the channels in a transmission group are specified with scope
@pval{ISDN_SCOPE_TG} and the transmission group identifier.  Transmission groups can also be
specified using scope @pval{ISDN_SCOPE_FG} and the Channel Identifier of one of the channels in the
facility group.
@pvindex ISDN_SCOPE_TG
@pvindex ISDN_SCOPE_FG

@subsubheading Channel

A channel refers to a specific B-Channel within a transmission and facility group.

Channels are identified using a unique channel identifier within the CCS provider.  Addresses
specifying a specific channel are specified with scope @pval{ISDN_SCOPE_CH} and the channel
identifier.  Channels can also be specified using scope @pval{ISDN_SCOPE_FG}, the facility group
identifier, and the Channel Identity of the channel within the facility group.
@pvindex ISDN_SCOPE_CH
@pvindex ISDN_SCOPE_FG

@subsubheading Data Link

A data link corresponds to a specific D-channel used for the control of channels.  Data links can be
grouped into facility groups.

Data links are identified using a unique data link identifier within the CCS provider.  Addresses
specifying all of the channels controlled by a data link are specified with scope
@code{ISDN_SCOPE_DL} and the data link identifier.

@figuresized{cci01a,2,UNI Data Model,4.0in}

@subsection NNI

The main features of the Network-Network Interface mode of communication are:

@enumerate
@item It is circuit oriented.
@item It employs quasi-associated signalling in that the path taken by signalling and the path taken by the circuits are
not necessarily related.
@item The protocol has one aspect and is peer-to-peer: that is, both sides of a signalling interface follow the same
protocol in the same way.
@item The network side of the protocol has formal maintenance and monitoring procedures and therefore reports most if
not all system events to maintenance.
@end enumerate

@subsubsection Address Formats

Addresses specifying all of the circuits known to the provider are specified with scope @pval{ISUP_SCOPE_DF} and
identifier zero (0).
@pvindex ISUP_SCOPE_DF

@subsubheading Signalling Points

A signalling point is the SS7 signalling point (central office) that the provider represents.  A CCS provider can
represent more than one signalling point.

A signalling point is identifier using a unique signalling point identifier within the CCS provider.  Addresses
specifying all of the circuits in signalling point are specified with scope @pval{ISUP_SCOPE_SP} and the signalling
point identifier.
@pvindex ISUP_SCOPE_SP

@subsubheading Signalling Relations

A signalling relation is a relationship between a local signalling point and a remote signalling point.  A signalling
relation consists of a single signalling interface.

Signalling relations are identified using a unique signalling relation identifier within the CCS provider.  Addresses
specifying all of the circuits in a signalling relation are specified with scope @pval{ISUP_SCOPE_SR} and the signalling
relation identifier.
@pvindex ISUP_SCOPE_SR

An ISUP Circuit Identification Code is only unique within a signalling relation.

@subsubheading Trunk Groups

A trunk group is a group of circuits that share the same routing characteristics for telephone calls.  A trunk group is
associated with a signalling relation.  For the NNI, a signalling relation is the combination of local MTP Point Code
and remote MTP Point Code.

A trunk group is identified using a unique trunk group identifier within the CCS provider.  Addresses specifying all of
the circuits in a trunk group are specified with scope @pval{ISUP_SCOPE_TG} and the trunk group identifier.
@pvindex ISUP_SCOPE_TG

@subsubheading Circuit Groups

A circuit group is a group of circuits that share the same common transmission facility (e.g, E1 span) and is therefore
impacted by any failure of the transmission facility.  All of the individual channels of an E1 span that are used to
carry calls are members of the circuit group.

Circuits groups are identified using a unique circuit group identifier within the CCS provider.  Addresses specifying
all of the circuits within a circuit group are specified with scope @pval{ISUP_SCOPE_CG} and the circuit group
identifier.  Circuit groups can also be specified using scope @pval{ISUP_SCOPE_SR} and the Circuit Identification Code
of one of the circuits within the circuit group.
@pvindex ISUP_SCOPE_CG
@pvindex ISUP_SCOPE_SR

@subsubheading Circuits

A circuit refers to a specific time slot within a digital facility.

Circuits are identified using a unique circuit identifier within the CCS provider.  Addresses specifying a specific
circuit are specified with scope @pval{ISUP_SCOPE_CT} and the circuit identifier.  Circuits can also be specified using
scope @pval{ISUP_SCOPE_CG}, the circuit group identifier, and the Circuit Identification Code of the circuit within the
group.  Circuits can also be specified using scope @pval{ISUP_SCOPE_SR}, the signalling relation identifier, and the
Circuit Identification Code of the circuit within the signalling relation.

@subsection Local Management

The CCI specifications also define a set of local management functions that apply to UNI and NNI modes of communication.
These services have local significance only.  Tables 1, 2 and 3 summarizes the CCI service primitives by their state and
service.

@node CCI Services Definition
@chapter CCI Services Definition

This section describes the services of the CCI primitives.  Time-sequence diagrams that illustrate the sequence of
primitives are included.  (Conventions for the time-sequence diagrams are defined in ITU-T X.210.)  The format of the
primitives will be defined later in this document.

@page
@section Local Management Services Definition

The services defined in this section are outside the scope of international standards.  These services apply to UNI
(User and Network), and NNI modes of communication.  They are invoked for the initialization/de-initialization of a
stream connected to the CCS provider.  They are also used to manage options supported by the CCS provider and to report
information on the supported parameter values.

@subsection Call Control Information Reporting Service

This service provides information on the options supported by the CCS provider.

@itemize @bullet
@item @prim{CC_INFO_REQ}:
@prindex CC_INFO_REQ
This primitive request that the CCS provider return the values of all the supported protocol parameters.  This request
may be invoked during any phase.
@item @prim{CC_INFO_ACK}:
@prindex CC_INFO_ACK
This primitive is in response to the N_INFO_REQ primitive and returns the values of the supported protocol parameters to
the CCS user.
@end itemize

The sequence of primitive for call control information management is shown in @figref{4}.

@figuresized{cci02,4,Sequence of Primitives: Call Control Information Reporting Service,4.0in}

@subsection CCS Address Service

This service allows a CCS user to determine the bound call control address and the connected call control address for a
given call reference associated with a stream.  It permits the CCS user to not necessarily retain this information
locally, and allows the CCS user to determine this information from the CCS provider at any time.

@itemize @bullet
@item @prim{CC_ADDR_REQ}:
@prindex CC_ADDR_REQ
This primitive requests that the CCS provider return information concerning which call control address the CCS user is
bound as well as the call control address upon which the CCS user is currently engaged in a call for the specified call
reference.
@item @prim{CC_ADDR_ACK}:
@prindex CC_ADDR_ACK
This primitive is in response to the @prim{CC_ADDR_REQ}
primitive and indicates to the CCS user the requested information.

@figuresized{cci42,5,Sequence of Primitives: Call Control User Address Service,4.0in}

@subsection CCS User Bind Service

This service allows a call control address to be associated with a stream.  It allows the CCS user to negotiate the
number of setup indications that can remain unacknowledged for that CCS user (a setup indication is considered
unacknowledged while it is awaiting a corresponding setup response or release request from the CCS user).  This service
also defines a mechanism that allows a stream (bound to a call control address of the CCS user) to be reserved to handle
incoming calls only.  This stream is referred to as the listener stream.

@itemize @bullet
@item @prim{CC_BIND_REQ}:
@prindex CC_BIND_REQ
This primitive request that the CCS user be bound to a particular call control address and negotiate the number of
allowable outstanding setup indications for that address.
@item @prim{CC_BIND_ACK}:
@prindex CC_BIND_ACK
This primitive is in response to the @prim{CC_BIND_REQ}
primitive and indicates to the user that the specified CCS user has been bound to a call control address.

@subsection Receipt Acknowledgement Service

@itemize @bullet
@item @prim{CC_OK_ACK}:

@section User-Network Interface Services Definition

This section describes the required call control service primitives that define the UNI interface.

The queue model for UNI is discussed in more detail in ITU-T Q.931.  For Q.931 specific conformance considerations, see
@ref{Addendum for Q.931 Conformance}.

The queue model represents the operation of a call control connection in the abstract by a pair of queues linking the
two call control addresses.  There is one queue for each direction of signalling transfer.  The ability of a user to add
objects to a queue will be determined by the behaviour of the user removing objects from that queue, and the state of
the queue.  The pair of queues is considered to be available for each potential call.  Objects that are entered or
removed from the queue are either as a result of interactions at the two call control addresses, or as the result of CCS
provider initiatives.

@itemize @bullet
@item A queue is empty until a setup object has been entered and can be returned to this state, with loss of its
contents, by the CCS provider.
@item Objects may be entered into a queue as a result of the action of the source CCS user, subject to control by the
CCS provider.
@item Objects may also be entered into a queue by the CCS provider.
@item Objects are removed from the queue under the control of the receiving CCS user.
@item Objects are normally removed under the control of the CCS user in the same order as they were entered except:
@itemize @bullet
@item if the object is of a type defined to be able to advance ahead of the preceding object, or
@item if the following object is defined to be destructive with respect to the preceding object on the queue.  If
necessary, the last object on the queue will be deleted to allow a destructive object to be entered \- they will
therefore always be added to the queue.  For example, "release" objects are defined to be destructive with respect to
all other objects.
@end itemize
@end itemize

@tabref{3} shows the ordering relationship among the queue model objects.

@figuresized{cci30,11,Sequence of Primitives: Call Control UNI Overview,4.0in}

@subsection Call Setup Phase

A pair of queues is associated with a call between two call control addresses (facility group and channel(s)) when the
CCS provider receives a @prim{CC_SETUP_REQ} primitive at one of the call control addresses resulting in a setup object
being entered into the queue.  The queues will remain associated with the call until a @prim{CC_RELEASE_REQ} or
@prim{CC_RELEASE_IND} (resulting in a release object) is either entered into or removed from a queue.  Similarly, in the
queue from the called CCS user, objects can be entered into the queue only after the setup object associated with the
@prim{CC_SETUP_RES} has been entered into the queue.  Alternatively, the called CCS user can enter a release object into
the queue instead of the setup object to terminate the call.
@prindex CC_SETUP_REQ
@prindex CC_RELEASE_REQ
@prindex CC_RELEASE_IND
@prindex CC_SETUP_RES

The call establishment procedure will fail if the CCS provider is unable to establish the call, or if the destination
CCS user is unable to accept the @prim{CC_SETUP_IND} (see call failure and call reject primitive definitions).
@prindex CC_SETUP_IND

@subsubsection User Primitives for Successful Call Setup

@itemize @bullet

This primitive requests that the CCS provider setup a call to the specified destination (called party number).
@item @prim{CC_MORE_INFO_REQ}:
@prindex CC_MORE_INFO_REQ
This primitive requests that the CCS provider provide more information to establish the call.  This primitive is not
issued for @emph{en bloc} signalling mode.
@item @prim{CC_INFORMATION_REQ}:
@prindex CC_INFORMATION_REQ
This primitive requests that the CCS provider provide more information (digits) in addition to the destination (called
party number) already specified in the @prim{CC_SETUP_REQ}
and subsequent @prim{CC_INFORMATION_REQ}

This primitive indicates to the calling CCS user that an event has caused call setup to fail on the selected address and
that a reattempt should be made (or has been made) on another call control address (facility group and channel(s)).

group  or equipment group levels.
@item @prim{CC_SETUP_IND}:
@prindex CC_SETUP_IND

@prindex CC_INFORMATION_IND
This primitive indicates to the CCS user more information (digits) in addition to the destination (called party number)
already indicated in the @prim{CC_SETUP_IND}
and subsequent @prim{CC_INFORMATION_IND}
primitives.  This primitive is not issued for @emph{en block} signalling mode.
@prindex CC_SETUP_IND
@prindex CC_INFORMATION_IND
@item @prim{CC_INFO_TIMEOUT_IND}:
@prindex CC_INFO_TIMEOUT_IND
This primitive indicates to the called CCS user that a timeout occurred while waiting for additional information (called
party number).  The receiving CCS User should determine whether sufficient address digits have been received and either
disconnect the call with the @prim{CC_DISCONNECT_REQ}
primitive or continue the call with @prim{CC_SETUP_RES}.
This primitive is not issued for @emph{en block} signalling mode.
@item @prim{CC_SETUP_CON}:
This primitive indicates to the CCS user that a call setup request has been confirmed on the indicated call control
address (channel(s)).
@end itemize
@prindex CC_DISCONNECT_REQ
@prindex CC_SETUP_RES
@prindex CC_SETUP_CON

The sequence of primitives in a successful call setup is defined by the time sequence diagram shown in @figref{12}.  The

@section Network-Network Interface Services Definition

This section describes the required call control service primitives that define the NNI interface.

The queue model for NNI is discussed in more detail in ITU-T Q.764.  For Q.764 specific conformance considerations, see
@ref{Addendum for Q.764 Conformance}.  For ETSI EN 300 356-1 V3.2.2 specific conformance considerations, see
@ref{Addendum for ETSI EN 300 356-1 V3.2.2 Conformance}.

@subsection Call Setup Phase

A pair of queues is associated with a call between the two call control addresses when the CCS provider receives a
@prim{CC_SETUP_REQ} primitive at one of the call control addresses resulting in a setup object being entered into the
queue.  The queues will remain associated with the call until a @prim{CC_RELEASE_REQ} (resulting in a release object) is
either entered into or removed from a queue.  Similarly, in the queue from the called CCS user, objects can be entered
into the queue only after the setup object associated with the @prim{CC_SETUP_RES} has been entered into the queue.
Alternatively, the called CCS user can enter a release object into the queue instead of the setup object to terminate
the call.
@prindex CC_SETUP_REQ
@prindex CC_SETUP_RES
@prindex CC_RELEASE_REQ

The call establishment procedure will fail if the CCS provider is unable to establish the call, or if the destination
CCS user is unable to accept the @prim{CC_SETUP_IND} (see call release primitive definition).
@prindex CC_SETUP_IND

@subsubsection User Primitives for Successful Call Setup

This primitive indicates to the calling CCS user that an event has caused call setup to fail on the selected address and
that a reattempt should be made (or has been made) on another call control address (signalling interface and
circuit(s)).  This primitive is only issued by the CCS provider if the CCS user is bound at the circuit level rather
than the circuit group or trunk group level.
@item @prim{CC_SETUP_IND}:

@prindex CC_SETUP_IND
@prindex CC_INFORMATION_IND
@item @prim{CC_INFO_TIMEOUT_IND}:
@prindex CC_INFO_TIMEOUT_IND
This primitive indicates to the called CCS user that a timeout occurred while waiting for additional information (called
party number).  The receiving CCS User should determine whether sufficient address digits have been received and either
disconnect the call with the @prim{CC_DISCONNECT_REQ}
primitive or continue the call with @prim{CC_SETUP_RES}.
@prindex CC_DISCONNECT_REQ
@prindex CC_SETUP_RES
@item @prim{CC_SETUP_CON}:
@prindex CC_SETUP_CON
This primitive indicates to the CCS user that a call setup request has been confirmed on the indicated call control

@subsection Continuity Test Phase

The continuity test service is only applicable to the NNI.

During the continuity test phase, a pair of queues has already been associated with the call between the selected call
control addresses (signalling interface and circuit(s)) during the setup phase.  The continuity test phase begins when
the CCS provider returns a @prim{CC_CONT_TEST_IND} primitive in response to a @prim{CC_SETUP_REQ} primitive that had the
@pval{ISUP_NCI_CONT_CHECK_REQUIRED} flag set in the call flags.  The continuity test phase also begins when the CCS user
responds with a @prim{CC_CONT_TEST_REQ} primitive in response to a @prim{CC_SETUP_IND} primitive that had the
@pval{ISUP_NCI_CONT_CHECK_REQUIRED} flag set in the call flags.
@prindex CC_CONT_TEST_IND
@prindex CC_SETUP_REQ
@prindex CC_CONT_TEST_REQ

@subsubsection Call Release Service

The call release procedure is initialized by the insertion of a release object (associated with a @prim{CC_RELEASE_REQ})

@subsubsection Blocking Service

The blocking service is used by the CCS user or management to effect local maintenance or hardware blocking on circuits,
or by the CCS provider to indicate to CCS user or management the remote maintenance or hardware blocking of circuits.

The blocking service is only applicable to the NNI.

The blocking service provides for the local and remote blocking of call control addresses (signalling interface and
circuit or circuit group) either for maintenance oriented or hardware failure purposes.

Blocking should only be invoked from streams that are listening on a circuit group that includes the circuits for which
blocking is requested, or the @pval{CC_DEFAULT_LISTENER}.  Maintenance blocking will also only be indicated on streams
that are listening on circuit group that includes the circuits for which blocking is requested, or in the absence of
such a stream, the @pval{CC_DEFAULT_LISTENER}.  When no stream is available to report maintenance blocking indications,
the indication should be responded to by the CCS provider without user or management indication.

@end verbatim
@end smallexample

@subsubheading Parameters

@vtable @parm
@item cc_primitive
Is the primitive type.
@item cc_addr_length
Is the length in bytes of the call control (circuit, circuit group) address to be bound to the stream.
@item cc_addr_offset
Is the offset from the beginning of the @msg{M_PROTO} block where the call control (circuit, circuit group) address
begins.
@item cc_setup_ind
Is the requested number of setup indications (simultaneous incoming calls) allowed to be outstanding by the CCS
provider for the specified protocol address.  (If the number of outstanding setup indications equals cc_setup_ind,
the CCS provider need not discard further incoming setup indications, but may choose to queue them internally until
the number of outstanding setup indications drops below the cc_setup_ind number.)  Only one stream per call control
address is allowed to have a cc_setup_ind number value greater than zero.  This indicates to the CCS provider that
this stream is the listener stream for the CCS user.  This stream will be used by the CCS provider for setup
indications for that call control address.

if a stream is bound as a listener stream, it is still able to initiate outgoing call setup requests.
@item cc_bind_flags
See "Flags" below.
@end vtable

@subsubheading Flags

@vtable @pval
@item CC_DEFAULT_LISTENER
@pvindex CC_DEFAULT_LISTENER
When set, this flag specifies that this stream is the "default listener stream."  This stream is used to pass setup
indications (or continuity check requests) for all incoming calls that contain protocol identifiers that are not
bound to any other listener, or when a listener stream with cc_setup_ind value of greater than zero is not found.
Also, the default listener will receive all incoming call indications that contain no user data (i.e., test calls)
and all maintenance indications (i.e., @prim{CC_MAINT_IND}).  Only one default listener stream is allowed per occurrence
of CCI.  An attempt to bind a default listener stream when one is already bound should result in an error (of type
@perr{CCADDRBUSY}).
@prindex CC_MAINT_IND
@peindex CCADDRBUSY
@item CC_TOKEN_REQUEST
@pvindex CC_TOKEN_REQUEST
When set, this flag specifies to the CCS provider that the CCS user has requested that a "token" be assigned to the
stream (to be used in the call response message), and the token value be returned to the CCS user via the
@prim{CC_BIND_ACK} primitive.  The token assigned by the CCS provider can then be used by the CCS user in a subsequent
@prim{CC_SETUP_RES} primitive to identify the stream on which the call is to be established.
@prindex CC_BIND_ACK
@prindex CC_SETUP_RES
@item CC_MANAGEMENT
@pvindex CC_MANAGEMENT
When set, this flag specifies to the CCS provider that this stream is to be used for circuit management indications
for the specified addresses.
@item CC_TEST
@pvindex CC_TEST
When set, this flag specifies to the CCS provider that this stream is to be used for continuity and test call
indications for the specified addresses.
@item CC_MAINTENANCE
@pvindex CC_MAINTENANCE
When set, this flag specifies to the CCS provider that this stream is to be used for maintenance indications for the
specified addresses.
@end vtable

primitive.
@prindex CC_BIND_ACK
@item @emph{Non-fatal errors}:  These errors will be indicated via the @prim{CC_ERROR_ACK}
@prindex CC_ERROR_ACK
primitive.  The applicable non-fatal errors are as follows:
@vtable @perr
@item CCSYSERR
@peindex CCSYSERR
A system error occurred and the UNIX system error is indicated in the primitive.
@item CCOUTSTATE
@peindex CCOUTSTATE
The primitive was issued from an invalid state.
@item CCBADADDR

intended to indicate protocol errors.
@c @item CCBADDIGS
@c @peindex CCBADDIGS
@c @item CCBADOPT
@c @peindex CCBADOPT
@item CCNOADDR
@peindex CCNOADDR
The CCS user did not provide a call control address and the CCS provider could not allocate an address to the user.
@item CCADDRBUSY
@peindex CCADDRBUSY
The CCS user attempted to bind a second stream to a call control address with the cc_setup_ind number set to a
non-zero value, or attempted to bind a second stream with the @pval{CC_DEFAULT_LISTENER}
flag value set to non-zero.
@pvindex CC_DEFAULT_LISTENER
@c @item CCBADCLR
@c @peindex CCBADCLR
@c @item CCBADTOK
@c @peindex CCBADTOK
@item CCBADFLAG
@peindex CCBADFLAG

@subsection Bind Protocol Address Acknowledgement

@subsubheading CC_BIND_ACK
@prindex CC_BIND_ACK

This primitive indicates to the CCS user that the specified call control user entity has been bound to the requested
call control address and that the specified number of connect indications are allowed to be queued by the CCS
provider for the specified network address.

@subsubheading Format

The format of the message is one @msg{M_PCPROTO} message block, and its structure is the following:
@smallexample
@verbatim
typedef struct CC_bind_ack {
        ulong cc_primitive;             /* always CC_BIND_ACK */
        ulong cc_addr_length;           /* length of address */
        ulong cc_addr_offset;           /* offset of address */
        ulong cc_setup_ind;             /* setup indications */
        ulong cc_token_value;           /* setup response token value */
} CC_bind_ack_t;
@end verbatim
@tpindex struct CC_bind_ack
@tpindex CC_bind_ack_t
@end smallexample

@subsubheading Parameters
@vtable @parm
@item cc_primitive
Indicates the primitive type.
@item cc_addr_length
Is the length of the call control address that was bound.
@item cc_addr_offset
Is the offset from the beginning of the @msg{M_PCPROTO} block where the call control address begins.
@item cc_setup_ind
Is the accepted number of setup indications allowed to be outstanding by the CCS provider for the specified call control
address.  If its value is zero, this stream cannot accept @prim{CC_SETUP_IND} messages.  If its value is greater than
zero, then the CCS user can accept @prim{CC_SETUP_IND} messages up to the value specified in this parameter before
having to respond with a @prim{CC_SETUP_RES} or a @prim{CC_DISCONNECT_REQ} message.
@prindex CC_SETUP_IND
@prindex CC_SETUP_IND
@prindex CC_SETUP_RES
@prindex CC_DISCONNECT_REQ
@item cc_token_value
Conveys the value of the "token" assigned to this stream that can be used by the CCS user in a @prim{CC_SETUP_RES}
primitive to accept a call on this stream.  It is a non-zero value, and is unique to all streams bound to the CCS
provider.
@prindex CC_SETUP_RES
@end vtable

The proper alignment of the address in the @msg{M_PCPROTO} message block is not guaranteed.

@subsubheading Rules

The following rules apply to the binding of the specified call control address to the stream:
@itemize @bullet
@item
If the @parm{cc_addr_length} field in the @prim{CC_BIND_REQ}
primitive is zero, then the CCS provider is to assign a call control address to the user.
@prindex CC_BIND_REQ
@item
The CCS provider is to bind the call control address as specified in the @prim{CC_BIND_REQ} primitive.  If the CCS
provider cannot bind the specified address, it may assign another call control address to the user.  It is the call
control user's responsibility to check the call control address returned in the @prim{CC_BIND_ACK} primitive to see if
it is the same as the one requested.
@prindex CC_BIND_REQ
@prindex CC_BIND_ACK
@end itemize

The following rules apply to negotiating cc_setup_ind argument:

@itemize @bullet

@item
The @parm{cc_setup_ind} number in the @prim{CC_BIND_ACK} primitive must be less than or equal to the corresponding
requested number as indicated in the @prim{CC_BIND_REQ} primitive.
@prindex CC_BIND_ACK
@prindex CC_BIND_REQ

@item
Only one stream that is bound to the indicated call control address may have a negotiated accepted number of maximum
setup indications greater than zero.  If a @prim{CC_BIND_REQ} primitive specifies a value greater than zero, but another
stream has already bound itself to the given call control address with a value greater than zero, the CCS provider
should assign another protocol address to the user.
@prindex CC_BIND_REQ

@item
If a stream with @parm{cc_setup_ind} number greater than zero is used to accept a call, the stream will be found busy
during the duration of that call and no other streams may be bound to that call control address with a
@parm{cc_setup_ind} number greater than zero.  This will prevent more than one stream bound to the identical call
control address from accepting setup indications.

@item
A stream requesting a @parm{cc_setup_ind} number of zero should always be legal.  This indicates to the CCS provider
that the stream is to be used to request call setup only.

@item
A stream with a negotiated @parm{cc_setup_ind} number greater than zero may generate setup requests or accept setup
indications.

@end itemize

@emph{If the above rules result in an error condition, then the CCS provider must issue a @prim{CC_ERROR_ACK}}
@emph{primitive to the CCS user specifying the error as defined in the description of the @prim{CC_BIND_REQ}}
@emph{primitive.}
@prindex CC_ERROR_ACK
@prindex CC_BIND_REQ

@subsubsection Call Control Setup Request

@subsubheading CC_SETUP_REQ
@prindex CC_SETUP_REQ

This primitive requests that the CCS provider make a call to the specified destination.

@subsubheading Format

The format of the message is one @msg{M_PROTO} message block.  The structure of the @msg{M_PROTO} message block is as follows:
@smallexample
@verbatim
typedef struct CC_setup_req {
        ulong cc_primitive;             /* always CC_SETUP_REQ */
        ulong cc_user_ref;              /* user call reference */

} CC_setup_req_t;
@end verbatim
@tpindex struct CC_setup_req
@tpindex CC_setup_req_t
@end smallexample

@subsubheading Parameters
@vtable @parm
@item cc_primitive
Specifies the primitive type.
@item cc_user_ref
Specifies a reference number known to the CCS user that uniquely identifies the current setup request.  When this
value is non-zero, it permits the CCS User to have multiple outstanding setup requests pending on the same stream.
Responses made by the CCS provider to the @prim{CC_SETUP_REQ} primitive will contain this CCS user call attempt reference.
@prindex CC_SETUP_REQ
@item cc_call_type
Specifies the type of call to be set up.  Call types supported are dependent upon the CCS provider and protocol, see
the addendum for call types for specific protocols.
@item cc_call_flags
Specifies a bit field of call options.  Call flags supported are depeddent upon the CCS provider and protocol, see
the addendum for call flags for specific protocols.
@item cc_cdpn_length
Specifies the length of the called party number parameter that conveys an address identifying the CCS user to which
the call is to be established.  This field will accommodate variable length numbers within a range supported by the
CCS provider.  If no called party address is provided by the CCS user, this field must be coded to zero.  The coding
of the called party number is protocol and provider-specific.
@item cc_cdpn_offset
Is the offset of the called party number from the beginning of the @msg{M_PROTO} message block.
@item cc_opt_length
Specifies the length of optional parameters to be conveyed in the call setup.  This field will accomodate variable
length addresses within a range supported by the CCS provider.  If no optional parameters are provided by the CCS
user, this field must be coded to zero.  The format of optional parameters are protocol and provider-specific, see
the addendum for the format of optional parameters for specific protocols.
@item cc_opt_offset
Specifies the offset of the optional parameters from the beginning of the @msg{M_PROTO} message block.
@item cc_addr_length
Specifies the length of the call control address parameter that conveys the call control address (circuit, circuit
group) of the CCS user entity to which the call is to be established.  The semantics of the values in the
@prim{CC_SETUP_REQ} is identical to the values in the @prim{CC_BIND_REQ}.
@prindex CC_SETUP_REQ
@prindex CC_BIND_REQ
@item cc_addr_offset
Specifies the offset of the call control address from the beginning of the @msg{M_PROTO} message block.
@end vtable

@subsubheading Rules

The following rules apply to the setup of calls to the specified addresses:
@itemize @bullet
@item
If the cc_cdpn_length field in the @prim{CC_SETUP_REQ} primitive is zero, then the CCS provider is to select a called party
@prindex CC_SETUP_REQ
number for the call.  If the CCS provider cannot select a called party number for the call, the CCS provider
responds with a @prim{CC_ERROR_ACK} primitive with error @perr{CCNOADDR}.
@prindex CC_ERROR_ACK
@peindex CCNOADDR
@item
If the cc_cdpn_length field in the @prim{CC_SETUP_REQ} primitive is non-zero, the CCS provider is to setup the call to the
@prindex CC_SETUP_REQ
specified number.  If the CCS provider cannot setup a call of the specified call type to the specified number the
call will fail and the CCS provider will return a @prim{CC_ERROR_ACK} with the appropriate error value (e.g., @perr{CCBADADDR}).
@peindex CCBADADDR
@prindex CC_ERROR_ACK
@end itemize

The following rules apply to the call control addresses (trunk groups and
circuit identifiers):
@itemize @bullet
@item
If the CCS user does not specify a call control address (i.e. cc_addr_length is set to zero), then the CCS provider
may attempt to assign a call control address, assign it a call reference and associate it with the stream for the
duration of the call.
@end itemize

The following rules apply to the CCS user call attempt reference:
@itemize @bullet
@item
If the CCS user does not specify a call attempt reference (i.e. the cc_user_ref is set to zero), then the CCS
provider can only support one outstanding outgoing call attempt for the stream.  If the CCS user specifies a call
attempt reference, all replies made by the CCS provider to this @prim{CC_SETUP_REQ} primitive will contain the CCS user
@prindex CC_SETUP_REQ
specified call attempt reference until either the call fails or is released, or after the CCS provider sends a
@prim{CC_SETUP_CON} primitive.
@prindex CC_SETUP_CON
@end itemize

@subsubheading Valid States

This primitive is valid in state @psta{CCS_IDLE}.
@stindex CCS_IDLE

@subsubheading New State

The new state depends upon the information provided in the @prim{CC_SETUP_REQ} message as follows:
@prindex CC_SETUP_REQ
@itemize @bullet
@item
If the setup request specifies that a continuity check was performed on a previous circuit, the new state is
@psta{CCS_WREQ_CCREP}
@stindex CCS_WREQ_CCREP
(awaiting report of the result of continuity test performed on the previous circuit).
@item
If the setup request specifies that a continuity check is required on the circuit, the new state is @psta{CCS_WIND_CTEST}
(awaiting indication of remote loop back on the circuit).
@item
If the setup request specifies that no continuity test is required on this or a previous circuit and that the
called party address contains partial information, the new state is @psta{CCS_WIND_MORE}
@stindex CCS_WIND_MORE
(awaiting the indication that more information is required).
@item
If the setup request specifies that no continuity test is required on this or a previous circuit and that the called
party address contains complete information, the new state is @psta{CCS_WCON_SREQ}
@stindex CCS_WCON_SREQ
(awaiting confirmation of the setup request).
@end itemize

@subsubheading Acknowledgements

The following acknowledgements are valid for this primitive:
@itemize ---
@item
@emph{Successful Call Establishment}:
This is indicated via the @prim{CC_SETUP_CON} primitive.  This results in the Call Establishment state.  For @prim{CC_SETUP_REQ}
@prindex CC_SETUP_CON
@prindex CC_SETUP_REQ
primitives where @pval{ISUP_NCI_CONT_CHECK_REQUIRED} is set, or where the CCS provider otherwise determines that a
continuity check is required on the circuit, success is still indicated via the @prim{CC_SETUP_CON} primitive.  In this
@prindex CC_SETUP_CON
case, the @prim{CC_SETUP_CON} primitive is not sent by the CCS provider unless the continuity check is successful.  For
@prindex CC_SETUP_CON
@psta{CCS_SETUP} primitives where @pval{ISUP_NCI_CONT_CHECK_PREVIOUS} is set, the @prim{CC_SETUP_CON} primitive is not sent by the CCS
@pvindex ISUP_NCI_CONT_CHECK_PREVIOUS
@prindex CC_SETUP_CON
provider until the CCS user sends a @prim{CC_CONT_REPORT_REQ} primitive indicating that continuity check on the previous
@prindex CC_CONT_REPORT_REQ
circuit has been successful.  Receipt of the @prim{CC_SETUP_CON} primitive always results in the Call Establishment state.
@prindex CC_SETUP_CON
@item
@emph{Unsuccessful Call Establishment}:
This is indicated via the @prim{CC_CALL_REATTEMPT_IND}, @prim{CC_CALL_FAILURE_IND}, or @prim{CC_RELEASE_IND} primitives.  For example, a
@prindex CC_CALL_FAILURE_IND
@prindex CC_CALL_REATTEMPT_IND
@prindex CC_RELEASE_IND
call may be rejected because either the called CCS user cannot be reached, or the CCS provider and/or the called CCS
user did not agree on the specified call type or options.  This results in the Idle state.  Where the
@prim{CC_CALL_REATTEMPT_IND} or @prim{CC_RELEASE_IND} primitives are sent before the @prim{CC_SETUP_CON} primitive, the
@prindex CC_SETUP_CON
@prindex CC_CALL_REATTEMPT_IND
@prindex CC_RELEASE_IND
@prim{CC_CALL_REATTEMPT_IND} or @prim{CC_RELEASE_IND} primitives will contain the CCS user specified call attempt reference.
@prindex CC_CALL_REATTEMPT_IND
@prindex CC_RELEASE_IND
@item
@emph{Non-fatal errors}:  These are indicated via the @prim{CC_ERROR_ACK} primitive.  The applicable non-fatal errors are
@prindex CC_ERROR_ACK
defined as follows:
@vtable @perr
@item CCSYSERR
@peindex CCSYSERR
A system error has occurred and the UNIX system eror is indicated in the primitive.
@item CCOUTSTATE
@peindex CCOUTSTATE
The primitive was issued from an invalid state.
@item CCBADADDR
@peindex CCBADADDR
The call control address as specified in the primitive was in an incorrect format, or the address contained illegal
information.
@item CCBADDIGS
@peindex CCBADDIGS
The called party number was in the incorrect format, or contained illegal information.  This is used only to handle
coding errors of the number and is not intended to provide for protocol errors.  Protocol errors should be conveyed
in the @prim{CC_CALL_REATTEMPT_IND}, @prim{CC_CALL_FAILURE_IND} or @prim{CC_RELEASE_IND} primitives.
@prindex CC_CALL_FAILURE_IND
@prindex CC_CALL_REATTEMPT_IND
@prindex CC_RELEASE_IND
@item CCBADOPT
@peindex CCBADOPT
The optional parameters were in an incorrect format, or contained illegal information.
@item CCNOADDR
@peindex CCNOADDR
The user did not provide a called party address field and one was required by the call type.  The CCS provider could
not select a called party address.
@item CCADDRBUSY
@peindex CCADDRBUSY
The CCS provider could not use the specified address because the specified address is already in use.
@item CCBADCLR
@peindex CCBADCLR
The call reference specified in the primitive was incorrect or illegal (not unique).
@c @item CCBADTOK
@c @peindex CCBADTOK
@c @item CCBADFLAG
@c @peindex CCBADFLAG
@c @item CCNOTSUPP

@subsection Collecting Information Phase

The following call control service primitive pertain to the collecting information phase of a call.

@page
@node Diagnostics Requirements
@chapter Diagnostics Requirements

Two error handling facilities should be provided to the call control service user: one to handle non-fatal errors,
ant the other to handle fatal errors.

@section Non-Fatal Error Handling Facility

These are errors that do not change the state of the call control service interface or the call reference as seen by
the call control service user, and provide the user the option of reissuing the call control service primitive with
the corrected options specification.  The non-fatal error handling is provided only to those primitive that require
acknowledgements, and uses the @prim{CC_ERROR_ACK} primitive to report these errors.  These errors retain the state of the
@prindex CC_ERROR_ACK
call control service interface and call reference the same as it was before the call control service provider
received the primitive that was in error.  Syntax errors and rule violations are reported via the non-fatal error
handling facility.

@section Fatal Error Handling Facility

These errors are issued by the CCS provider when it detects errors that are not correctable by the call control service
user, or if it is unable to report a correctable error to the call control service user.  Fatal errors are indicated via
the @cite{STREAMS}
@cpindex STREAMS
message type @msg{M_ERROR} with the UNIX system error EPROTO.  The @msg{M_ERROR} @cite{STREAMS}
@cpindex STREAMS
message type will result in the failure of all the UNIX system calls on the stream.  The call control service user can
recover from a fatal error by having all the processes close the files associated with the stream, and then reopening
them for processing.

Q.931 call processing layer.

@section Primitives and Rules for Q.931 Conformance

The following are the rules that apply to the CCI primitives for Q.931 compatibility.

@subsection Common Primitive Parameters

@subsubsection Call Control Addresses

@subsubheading Format

The format of call control addresses is as follows:

@subsubheading Parameters
@vtable @parm
@item cc_addr_length
Specifies or indicates the length of the call control address.  If a call control address is not included in the
primitive, this parameter must be coded zero (0).
@item cc_addr_offset
Specifies or indicates the offset of the address from the begining of the primitive.  If a call control address is
not included with the primitive, this parameter must be coded zero (0).
@end vtable

@subsubheading Address Format

The format of the call control addresses for Q.931 conforming CCS providers is as follows:
@smallexample
@verbatim
typedef struct isdn_addr {
        ulong scope;            /* the scope of the identifier */
        ulong id;               /* the identifier within the scope */
        ulong ci;               /* channel identifier within the scope */
} isdn_addr_t;
@end verbatim
@tpindex struct isdn_addr
@tpindex isdn_addr_t
@verbatim

#define ISDN_SCOPE_CH       1   /* channel scope */
#define ISDN_SCOPE_FG       2   /* facility group scope */
#define ISDN_SCOPE_TG       3   /* transmission group scope */
#define ISDN_SCOPE_EG       4   /* equipment group scope */
#define ISDN_SCOPE_XG       5   /* customer/provider group scope */
#define ISDN_SCOPE_DF       6   /* default scope */
@end verbatim
@end smallexample

@subsubheading Address Fields
@vtable @pval
@item scope
Specifies or indicates the scope of the call control address.  See "Scope" below.
@item id
Specifies or indicates the identifier within the scope.
@item cic
Specifies or indicates the Channel Indicator significant within the scope.
@end vtable

@subsubheading Scope

The scope of the address is one of the following:
@vtable @pval
@item ISDN_SCOPE_CH
@pvindex ISDN_SCOPE_CH
Specifies or indicates that the scope of the call control address is an ISDN B-channel.  The identifier within the
scope is an identifier which uniquely identifies the channel to the CCS provider.  Channel scope addresses may also
be used to specify or indicate transmission groups, equipment groups and customer/provider groups.  When used in an
indication or confirmation primitive, the CCS provider includes the Channel Identification associated with the
circuit in the address.

For multi-rate calls where multiple channels are involved, the channel scoped address specifies the lowest numerical
Channel Identifier in the group of circuits and the Channel Identifier provides the channel map of the group of
channels.
@item ISDN_SCOPE_FG
@pvindex ISDN_SCOPE_FG
Specifies or indicates that the scope of the call control address is an ISDN facility group (group of one or more
redundant D-channels).  The identifier within the scope is an identifier which uniquely identifies the ISDN
interface to the CCS provider.  Facility group scope addresses may also be used to specify or indicate channels,
equipment groups or customer/provider groups.  When used in an indication or confirmation primitive, the CCS
provider includes the Channel Identifier associated with the indicated channels.
@item ISDN_SCOPE_TG
@pvindex ISDN_SCOPE_TG
Specifies or indicates that the scope of the call control address is an ISDN transmission group (PRI interface).
The identifier within the scope is an indentifier which uniquely identifies the ISDN physical interface to the CCS
provider.  Transmission group scope addresses may also be used to specify or indicate equipment groups or
customer/provider groups.  When used in an indication or confirmation primitive, the CCS provider may include the
Channel Identifier associated with the facility group for the physical interface.
@item ISDN_SCOPE_EG
@pvindex ISDN_SCOPE_EG
Specifies or indicates that the scope of the call control address is an ISDN equipment group.  The identifier within
the scope is an identifier that uniquely identifies the equipment group to the CCS provider.  Equipment group scoped
addresses may aslo be used to specify or indicate customer/provider groups.
@item ISDN_SCOPE_XG
@pvindex ISDN_SCOPE_XG
Specifies or indicates that the scope of the call control address is an ISDN customer/provider group.  The
identifier within the scope is an identifier that uniquely identifies the customer/provider group to the CCS
provider.
@item ISDN_SCOPE_DF
@pvindex ISDN_SCOPE_DF
Specifies or indicates that the scope of the call control address is the default scope.  The identifier within the
scope and Channel Identifier are unused and should be ignored by the CCS user and will be coded zero (0) by the CCS
provider.
@end vtable

@subsubheading Rules

@b{Rules for scope:}
@enumerate
@item
In primitives in which the address parameter occurs, the scope field setting indicates the scope of the address
parameter.
@item
Only one call control address can be specified with a signle scope.
@item
Not all scopes are necessarily supported by all primitives.  See the particular primitive in this addendum.
@end enumerate

@b{Rules for addresses:}
@enumerate
@item
The address contained in the primitive contains the following:
@itemize @bullet
@item
A scope.
@item
An identifier within the scope or zero (0).
@item
A channel indication within the scope or zero (0).
@end itemize
@item
If the scope of the address is @pval{ISDN_SCOPE_DF}, then both the identifier and channel indication fields should
@pvindex ISDN_SCOPE_DF
be coded zero (0) and will be ignored by the CCS user or provider.
@item
If the scope of the address is @pval{ISDN_SCOPE_EG} or @pval{ISDN_SCOPE_XG}, then the channel indication field should be
@pvindex ISDN_SCOPE_XG
@pvindex ISDN_SCOPE_EG
coded zero (0) and will be ignored by the CCS user or provider.
@item
In all other scopes, the channel indication field is optional and is coded zero (0) if unused.
@end enumerate

@subsubsection Optional Information Elements

@subsubheading Format

The format of the optional information elements is as follows:

@subsubheading Parameters
@vtable @parm
@item cc_opt_length
Indicates the length of the optional information elements associated with the primitive.  For Q.931 conforming CCS
providers, the format of the optional information elements is the format of a Information Element list as specified
in Q.931.
@item cc_opt_offset
indicates the offset of the option information elements from the beginning of the block.
@end vtable

@subsubheading Rules

@b{Rules for optional information elements:}
@enumerate
@item
The optional information elements provided by the CCS user may be checked for syntax by the CCS provider.  If the
CCS provider discovers a syntax error in the format of the optional information elements, the CCS provider should
respond with a @prim{CC_ERROR_ACK} primitive with error @perr{CCBADOPT}.
@peindex CCBADOPT
@prindex CC_ERROR_ACK
@item
For some primitives, specific optional information elements might be interpreted by the CCS provider and alter the
function of some primitives.  See the specific primitive descriptions later in this addendum.
@item
Except for optional information elements interpreted by the CCS provider as specified later in this addendum, the
optional information elements are treated as opaque and the optional information element list only is checked for
syntax.  Opaque information elements will be passed to the ISDN message without examination by the CCS provider.
@item
To perform specific functions, additional optional information elements may be added to ISDN messages by the CCS
provider.
@item
To perform specific functions, optional information elements may be modified by the CCS provider before they are
added to ISDN messages.
@end enumerate

@pvindex CC_DEFAULT_LISTENER
flag is set, the address should be left unspecified by the CCS user and should be ignored
by the CCS provider.
@end enumerate

@b{Rules for setup indicatesion:}
@enumerate
@item
If the number of setup indications is non-zero, the stream is bound as a listening stream.  Listening streams will
receive all calls that are incoming on the address bound:
@itemize @bullet
@item
If the address bound is a channel (@pval{CC_CHANNEL} flag set), all incoming calls on the channel will be delivered to the
@pvindex CC_CHANNEL
stream listening on the channel.  These streams will have a maximum number of setup indications of one (1).
@item
If the address bound is a channel group (@pval{CC_CHANNEL_GROUP} flag set), all incoming calls on the channel group will be
delivered to the stream listening on the channel group.  These streams will have a maximum number of setup
indications no higher than the number of channels in the channel group.
@item
If the address bound is a trunk group (@pval{CC_TRUNK_GROUP} flag set), all incoming calls on the trunk group will be
@pvindex CC_TRUNK_GROUP
delivered to the stream listening on the trunk group.  These streams will have a maximum number of setup indications
no higher than the number of channels in the trunk group.
@end itemize
@end enumerate

@b{Rules for bind flags:}
@enumerate
@item
For Q.931 conforming CCS providers, the @pval{CC_DEFAULT_LISTENER}
@pvindex CC_DEFAULT_LISTENER

stream.  There can only be one stream bound with the @pval{CC_DEFAULT_LISTENER}
@pvindex CC_DEFAULT_LISTENER
flag set.
@item
Only one of @pval{CC_DEFAULT_LISTENER},
@pvindex CC_DEFAULT_LISTENER
@pval{CC_CHANNEL}, @pval{CC_CHANNEL_GROUP} or
@pvindex CC_CHANNEL

@node Addendum for Q.764 Conformance
@unnumbered Addendum for Q.764 Conformance

This addendum describes the formats and rules that are specific to ISUP Q.764.  The addendum must be used along with
the generic CCI as defined in the main document when implementing a CCS provider that will be configured with the
Q.764 call processing layer.

@section Primitives and Rules for Q.764 Conformance

The following are the rules that apply to the CCI primitives for Q.764 compatibility.

@subsection Common Primitive Parameters

@subsubsection Call Control Addresses

@subsubheading Format

The format of call control addresses is as follows:

@subsubheading Parameters
@vtable @parm
@item cc_addr_length
Specifies or indicates the length of the call control address.  If a call control address is not included in the
primitive, this parameter must be coded zero (0).
@item cc_addr_offset
Specifies or indicates the offset of the address from the begining of the primitive.  If a call control address is
not included with the primitive, this parameter must be coded zero (0).
@end vtable

@subsubheading Address Format

The format of the call control addresses for Q.764 conforming CCS providers is as follows:
@smallexample
@verbatim
typedef struct isup_addr {
        ulong scope;            /* the scope of the identifier */
        ulong id;               /* the identifier within the scope */
        ulong cic;              /* circuit identification code within the scope */
} isup_addr_t;
@end verbatim
@tpindex struct isup_addr
@tpindex isup_addr_t

#define ISUP_SCOPE_CT           1       /* circuit scope */
#define ISUP_SCOPE_CG           2       /* circuit group scope */
#define ISUP_SCOPE_TG           3       /* trunk group scope */
#define ISUP_SCOPE_SR           4       /* signalling relation scope */
#define ISUP_SCOPE_SP           5       /* signalling point scope */

#define ISUP_SCOPE_CIC          7       /* for unidentified cic addresses */
@end smallexample

@subsubheading Address Fields
@vtable @pval
@item scope
Specifies or indicates the scope of the call control address.  See "Scope" below.
@item id
Specifies or indicates the identifier within the scope.
@item cic
Specifies or indicates the Circuit Identification Code significant within the scope.
@end vtable

@subsubheading Scope

The scope of the address is one of the following:
@vtable @pval
@item ISUP_SCOPE_CT
@pvindex ISUP_SCOPE_CT
Specifies or indicates that the scope of the call control address is a ISUP circuit.  The identifier within the
scope is an identifier which uniquely identifies a circuit to the CCS provider.  Circuit scope addresses may also be
used to specify or indicate circuit groups, trunk groups, signalling relations and signalling points.  When used in
an indication or confirmation primitive, the CCS provider includes the Circuit Identification Code associated with
the circuit in the address.

For multi-rate calls where multiple circuits are involved, the circuit scoped address specifies the lowest numerical
Circuit Identification Code in the group of circuits.
@item ISUP_SCOPE_CG
@pvindex ISUP_SCOPE_CG
Specifies or indicates that the scope of the call control address is a ISUP circuit group.  The identifier within
the scope is an identifier which uniquely identifies a circuit group to the CCS provider.  Circuit group scope
addresses may also be used to specify or indicate signalling relations and signalling points.  When used in an
indication or confirmation primitive, the CCS provider includes the Circuit Identification Code associated with the
circuit group (lowest numerical value CIC in the circuit group range).
@item ISUP_SCOPE_TG
@pvindex ISUP_SCOPE_TG
Specifies or indicates that the scope of the call control address is a ISUP trunk group.  The identifier within the
scope is an identifier which uniquely identifies a trunk group to the CCS provider.  Trunk group scope addresses may
also be used to specify or indicate circuits, signalling relations and signalling points.  The Circuit
Identification Code must be used to specify a circuit within the trunk group.
@item ISUP_SCOPE_SR
@pvindex ISUP_SCOPE_SR
Specifies or indicates that the scope of the call control address is a ISUP signalling relation.  The identifier
within the scope is an identifier which uniquely identifies a signalling relation to the CCS provider.  Signalling
relation scope addresses may also be used to specify or indicate circuits and signalling points.  The Circuit
Identification Code must be used to sepcify a circuit (equipped or unequipped) within the signalling relation.
@item ISUP_SCOPE_SP
@pvindex ISUP_SCOPE_SP
Specifies or indicates that the scope of the call control address is a ISUP signalling point.  The identifier within
the scope is an identifier which uniquely identifies a local signalling point to the CCS provider.  Signalling point
scope addresses may only indicate local signalling points.  The Circuit Identification Code is unused and should be
ignored by the CCS user and will be coded zero (0) by the CCS provider.
@item ISUP_SCOPE_DF
@pvindex ISUP_SCOPE_DF

The format of the optional parameters for Q.764 conforming CCS providers is as follows:

@subsubheading Parameters
@vtable @parm
@item cc_opt_length
Specifies or indicates the length of the optional parameters associated with the primitive.  For Q.764 conforming
CCS providers, the format of the optional parameters is the format of the Optional Parameters list (without the
pointer or End of Optional Parameters octets) as specified in Q.763.
@item cc_opt_offset
Specifies the offset of the optional parameters from the beginning of the block.
@end vtable

@subsubheading Rules

@b{Rules for optional parameters:}
@enumerate
@item
The optional parameters provided by the CCS user may be checked for syntax by the CCS provider.  If the CCS provider
discovers a syntax error in the format of the optional parameters, the CCS provider should respond with a
@prim{CC_ERROR_ACK} primitive with error @perr{CCBADOPT}.
@prindex CC_ERROR_ACK
@peindex CCBADOPT
@item
For some primitives, specific optional parameters might be interpreted by the CCS provider and alter the function of
some primitives.  See the specific primitive descriptions later in this addendum.
@item
Except for optional parameters interpreted by the CCS provider as specified later in this addendum, the optional
parameters are treated as opaque and the optional parameter list only is checked for syntax.  Opaque parameters will
be passed to the ISUP message without examination by the CCS provider.
@item
To perform specific functions, additional optional parameters may be added to ISUP messages by the CCS provider.
@item
To perform specific functions, optional parameters may be modified by the CCS provider before being added to ISUP
messages.

@subsubheading Parameters
@vtable @parm
@item cc_addr_length
Indicates the length of the address to bind.
@item cc_addr_offset
Indicates the offset of the address to bind from the beginning of the block.
@item cc_setup_ind
Indicates the maximum number of setup (or continuity check) indications that will be outstanding for the listening
stream.
@item cc_bind_flags
Indicates the options assocated with the bind.  The bind flags can be as follows:
@vtable @pval
@item CC_DEFAULT_LISTENER
When set, this flag specifies that this stream is the "default listener stream."  This stream is used to pass setup
indications (or continuity check requests) for all incoming calls that contain protocol identifiers that are not
bound to any other listener, or when a listener stream with cc_setup_ind value of greater than zero is not found.
Also, the default listener will receive all incoming call indications that contain no user data (i.e., test calls)
and all maintenance indications (i.e., @prim{CC_MAINT_IND}).  Only one default listener stream is allowed per occurrence of
@prindex CC_MAINT_IND
CCI.  An attempt to bind a default listener stream when one is already bound should result in an error (of type
@perr{CCADDRBUSY}).
@peindex CCADDRBUSY
@item CC_TOKEN_REQUEST
@pvindex CC_TOKEN_REQUEST
When set, this flag specifies to the CCS provider that the CCS user has requested that a "token" be assigned to the
stream (to be used in the call response message), and the token value be returned to the CCS user via the
@prim{CC_BIND_ACK} primitive.  The token assigned by the CCS provider can then be used by the CCS user in a subsequent

@appendix Mapping of CCI Primitives to Q.931

The mapping of CCI primitives to Q.931 primitives is shown in @tabref{2}.  For the most part, this mapping
is a one to one mapping of service primitives, with the exception of @emph{Setup Response} and @emph{Setup
Confirm}.

@tabfigsized{cci_tab2,2,Mapping of CCI primitives to Q.931 Primitives,4.0in}

In Q.931 the @emph{Setup Response} and @emph{Setup Confirm} primitives and issued only once the voice channel is
connected.  In OpenSS7 CCI, the @prim{CC_SETUP_RES} and @prim{CC_SETUP_CON} primitives are used to accept the addressing and

assign a stream and correspond to the first backward message (i.e, @emph{Processing}, @emph{Alerting} or

@item Signalling Data Link Service Data Unit
A grouping of SDL user data whose boundaries are preserved from one end of the
signalling data link connection to the other.
@item Data transfer
The phase in connection and connectionless modes that supports the transfer of
data between to signalling data link users.
@item SDL provider
The signalling data link layer protocol that provides the services of the
signalling data link interface.
@item SDL user
The user-level application or user-level or kernel-level protocol that accesses
the services of the signalling data link layer.
@item Local management
The phase in connection and connectionless modes in which a SDL user initializes
a stream and attaches a PPA address to the stream.  Primitives in this phase
generate local operations only.
@item PPA
The point at which a system attaches itself to a physical communications medium.
@item PPA identifier
An identifier of a particular physical medium over which communication
transpires.
