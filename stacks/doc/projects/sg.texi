@node Executive Overview
@unnumbered Executive Overview

This document provides a @value{MANUAL_TYPE} for the @value{MANUAL_TITLE}.
The initial and primary purpose of this equipment is to provide connectivity between a legacy SS7
network and a SIGTRAN network.  Because the solution attempts to avoid excessive costs associated
with long- and short-haul SS7 TDM circuits, the platform benefits from using low cost commodity
hardware and open source software.

@subsubheading The OpenSS7 Project

The @uref{http://www.openss7.org/, OpenSS7 Project} is an open source software project that has
developed many protocol components within the SS7, SIGTRAN, ISDN and VoIP protocol stacks.
Intellectual property rights for the OpenSS7 Project are held by @uref{http://www.openss7.com/,
OpenSS7 Corporation}.  All OpenSS7 Project software is eventually licensed under the GNU Affero General Public
License Version 3.  OpenSS7 Corporation also provides commercial licensing of OpenSS7 Project
software under terms less restrictive than the AGPL.

@subsubheading Signalling Gateway (SG) Platform

OpenSS7 can provide Signalling Gateway Platform capabilities in a high-performance, low-cost,
small-footprint platform leveraging the GNU/Linux operating system distributions and tools, and
utilizing low-cost commodity hardware.

For detail on platform applications, see @ref{Application Architecture}, @ref{Network Architecture},
@ref{Optional Application Support}, and @ref{Optional Network Support}.

@subsubheading Open Source Software

The OpenSS7 Project leverages the widespread use of GNU/Linux operation systems, distributions, and
FSF tools such as @samp{autoconf} and open source software such as @dfn{RPM}.  For example, this
document was formatted for PDF, HTML, info and plain text using the GNU @dfn{texinfo} system,
@samp{autoconf}, and the @TeX{} formatting system.

The open source model avoids proprietary lock-in and permits in-house or outsourced development.
All source code is available for use and modification by the end customer.  All build tools,
documentation and associated resources are generally available.  The availability of the source code
and complete documentation eases problem resolution and can offer upgrades and fixes even in advance
of client problem reports.  

For details on software solutions, see @ref{Protocol Architecture}, @ref{Software Architecture},
@ref{Optional Protocol Support}, and @ref{Optional Software Support}.

@subsubheading Commodity Hardware

By best utilizing commodity PC or standardized CompactPCI and AdvancedTCA hardware, OpenSS7 makes
available the highest performance platforms available on the market at back-to-school prices.  When
carrier-grade is not essential, 3GHz Pentium or Xeon class servers in hardened rack mount chassis
can be used at a fraction of the cost, and yet outperform, other solutions.  Where carrier-grade is
necessary, embedded Linux on standardized CompactPCI and AdvanceTCA NEBS compliant chassis make for
a higher cost, but more reliable alternative.

For details on hardware solutions, see @ref{Platform Architecture}, @ref{Hardware Architecture},
and @ref{Optional Hardware Support}.

@subsubheading Integrated Management

Utilizing open source management tools, such as @command{net-snmp} and @command{OSIMIS}, OpenSS7
protocol stacks provide integrated management support for SNMPv2c, SNMPv3, or CMISE/CMIP.  The
entire platform, from alarms to provisioning, can be provided using integrated SNMP agents.

For details on management solutions, see @ref{Platform Architecture}, @ref{Management Architecture},
and @ref{Optional Management Support}.

@subsubheading Rapid Development

The OpenSS7 Project has already developed protocol components completing the SS7 and SIGTRAN
signalling stacks including MTP Level 2 and Level 3, ISUP, SCCP, TCAP; and SCTP, M2PA, M2UA, M3UA,
SUA and TUA.  Development of a Signalling Gateway Platform to meet small to large scale deployment
requirement needs only customization of the platform for specific needs.

For details on scheduling, see @ref{Logistics}.

@subsubheading An Evolving Solution

The OpenSS7 Project is evolving to support more protocol stacks including ISDN and VoIP.  Support
for an ever expanding capability is demonstrated by the additional options available as described in
@ref{Optional Application Support}, @ref{Optional Network Support},
@ref{Optional Protocol Support}, @ref{Optional Software Support},
and @ref{Optional Hardware Support}.

@subsubheading Conclusions

In summary, a Signalling Gateway Platform for small and large scale deployments is an excellent
application of the OpenSS7 SS7 and SIGTRAN stacks and can be provided at an affordable price on
short time-lines, while offering an evolution path for future deployment applications.

@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction
@cindex Introduction

This document provides a @value{MANUAL_TYPE} for a platform to provide the @value{MANUAL_TITLE}
capabilities.  The primary driver for the @value{MANUAL_TITLE} is to provide a system that avoids
the use of expensive graded long haul SS7 facilities.  The document provides a high-level design and
proposal for a production system to provide this capability.

The proposal utilizes, where possible, existing OpenSS7 SS7 and SIGTRAN stack components and
provides a develoment plan for components that are specific to the @value{MANUAL_TITLE}
requirements.

This document discusses the resulting software configuration that will be put in place on the
production system, the platform configuration for the production system, and a network configuration
for deployment.  Also discussed is an overview of the project management logistics for successful
completion over the course of this development project.

It is intended that this document be a ``living'' document, that is updated over the course of this
development project.

@node The OpenSS7 Signalling Gateway
@section The OpenSS7 Signalling Gateway
@cindex The OpenSS7 Signalling Gateway

This project provides an @value{MANUAL_TITLE} that translates signalling traffic between the
traditional SS7 signalling network and a SIGTRAN signalling network.  The gateway also provides a
basis for geographic and functional redundancy of systems within the SIGTRAN signalling network.

@node Project Drivers
@section Project Drivers
@cindex Project drivers

The lead purpose of the @value{MANUAL_TITLE} is to provide a flexible and redundant Signalling
Gateway front-end solution for the OpenSS7 VoIP Switch.

@node Scope
@section Scope
@cindex Scope

Because the focus on low cost, high performance, and production stability, the @value{MANUAL_TITLE}
is constructed using commodity computing platforms and PCI based hardware cards, but using hardenned
NEBS-3/ETSI compliant chasses in an active/standby failover configuration.  This will result in a
cost-effective carrier grade system for mid- to low deployment cost.

@subsection Phases
@cindex Project phases

The longer term project is broken into the following phases:

@table @dfn
@item Phase 1
The initial phase of the project is intended to provide the capabilities of the
@value{MANUAL_TITLE} operation for the deployment platform.
@item Phase 2
The second phase of the project is intended on performing SS7 signalling interoperability testing
for live deployment of the signalling gateway production platform.
@item Phase 3
The third phase of the project is to integrate the deployment platform with the OpenSS7 VoIP Switch
using the Internet Protocol suite.
@item Phase 4
The fourth phase of the project is to perform interoperability testing and a field trial of the
deployment platform.
@item Phase 5
The fifth phase of the project is to complete management system integration for remote monitoring
and provisioning for production service.
@end table

@node Gates
@subsection Gates
@cindex Project gates

Each phase of the project consists of seven gates.  The seven gates are defined as follows:

@table @dfn

@item Gate 0 --- Concept

@dfn{Gate 0} is passed when the initial concept has been elucidated and work is begun on a
High-Level Design.  This is an internal OpenSS7 gate.

@item Gate 1 --- High Level Design

@dfn{Gate 1} is passed when the high-level design has been reviewed to the satisfaction of the
consumers of the project.  This is an external review gate.  OpenSS7 internally passes this gate
once the High-Level Design has been published and work is begun on a detailed design.@footnote{This
document is a @value{MANUAL_TYPE} document and it meets the internal requirements for passing Gate 1
of Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the project.  An external review of this document by a Beta or Gamma
client or sponsor is pending.}

@item Gate 2 --- Detailed Design

@dfn{Gate 2} is passed when the detailed design has been reviewed to the satisfaction of the
consumers of the project and the developers on the project.  This is an external as well as an
internal review gate.  OpenSS7 passes this gate once the Detailed Design has been published and work
has begun on development and implementation of the design.@footnote{OpenSS7 requires a contractual
commitment for purchase from a Beta or Gamma client, or funding from a Sponsor of the OpenSS7
Project, before this gate can be passed and development started.} Passing this gate moves from the
design stage to the development stage of the project.

@item Gate 3 --- Deployment and Implementation

@dfn{Gate 3} is passed when the software and systems development and implementation to the detailed
design is complete and testing has begun.  This is an internal review gate.  OpenSS7 internally
passes this gate when software is code complete and hardware has been installed for testing.

@item Gate 4 --- System Test

@dfn{Gate 4} is passed once the product implementation meets all internal ad hoc and formal
conformance test suites and internal testing is complete.  This is an internal review gate.  OpenSS7
passes this gate internally once conformance testing is complete.  Passing this gate moves from the
development stage to the support stage of the project.

@item Gate 5 --- Acceptance Test

@dfn{Gate 5} is passed once the product implementation has passed external Gamma client acceptance
testing.  This is an external review gate.  OpenSS7 passes this gate internally once participation
in external acceptance testing is complete.

@item Gate 6 --- Project Complete

@dfn{Gate 6} is passed once all support obligations for the product implementation have been
discharged.  This is an internal review gate.  OpenSS7 passes this gate once support agreements have
terminated.

@section Solution Architecture
@cindex Solution architecture

Although the functions of @dfn{Media Gateway Controller}, @dfn{Media Gateway} and @dfn{Signalling
Gateway} have been decomposed, and in the past these functional groups have been implemented on
separate physical platforms, modern compute capacity and densities permit these functions to be
integrated into a single physical platform without limitation.  Open standard interfaces are
utilized internal to the platform to permit a decomposed model to be split out and to permit ETSI
Tiphon Version 4 compatibility as well as Multi-Services Forum Version 2 compatibility.

@subsection @value{MANUAL_TITLE} for Deployment

In light of the foregoing, the solution architecture takes the form of an integrated signalling gateway
capable of providing a number of functional groups in the traditional models.  The
@value{MANUAL_TITLE} integrates the following functional groups while still permitting standard
interfaces to be exposed for maximum deployment flexibility:

On the IP network side of the device, the platform is connected on an internal LAN with multiple
Ethernet segments and IP subnetworks.  ISUP signalling originating at a Service Switching Point
(SSP) within the SS7 network are accepted and responded to by MGC within the IP network.  Signalling
lis converted from traditional TDM SS7 to SIGTRAN over the IP network via the Signalling Gateway.

From the viewpoint of the SS7 or SIGTRAN network, the platform acts as a Signalling Gateway for the
purposes of passing ISUP and LNP messages between the MGC and the remotely attached SSPs and SCPs.

From the SS7 network, the SG platforms appear to be STPs and are connected with B/D-Links to an
adjacent STP pair.@footnote{The SG platforms also support full STP operation and can locally attach
SSP and SCP nodes with A-, E-, or F-links.}

From the IP network, the SG platforms appear in the SG as STP configuration for SIGTRAN.
Although MGC's are shown within the IP network as being provided SS7 connectivity by the SG
platforms, any SIGTRAN equipped SS7 user application may also be supported by this configuration.

@subsubsection Global Title Translations (GTT)

The Signalling Connection Control Part (SCCP) Global Title Translations (GTT) module is responsible
for responding to SCCP-GTT translations originating from the SCCP module beneath and is responsible
for generating outgoing SCCP-GTT translations to the SCCP module beneath.  To perform its function,
the SCCP-GTT indexes all information based on the SCCP Address, including dynamic (state) and
provisioned (result) information.  For performance in both a testing and production environment, the
module provides three levels of database partitioning and caching:

@table @emph
@item Rules
Rules can be provided that are used to determine provisioned information based on components of
the index (GT).  These rules can be used to generate a rather large simulated database without
maintaining or accessing large database record areas.  The rule base provides a simulated
partitioned database.  Each rule refers to a template or partial template of provisioned data.
@item Templates
Templates can be provided that specify a profile of provisioned information for a class of
indexes (GT).  Templates provide a compact local in-kernel cache of templates.  Indexes reference
templates rather than complete records.
@item Records
Records can be provided that specify the provisioned information for the specific index (GT).
Records provide a local in-kernel cache of specified records.  Records are unique for each index.
@item Translations
The application can be queried by indicating the index (GT) and the module awaits a response
containing the provisioned information.  Translations provide access to an external database or
algorithm.

For the High Performance GSM/UMTS GPRS HLR application, messages can be routed on Translation Type
or on the basis of the Subsystem Number alone, resulting in a simple rule provided to the SCCP-GTT.
If the High Performance GSM/UMTS GPRS HLR application is not expected to perform in any other role,
the High Performance GSM/UMTS GPRS HLR application can bind as the "Default Destination" for all
SCCP Unitdata messages, obviating the need for GTT.
