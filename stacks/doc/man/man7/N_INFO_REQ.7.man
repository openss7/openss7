} N_info_req_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.I PRIM_type
Indicates the primitive type.
.SH STATE
This primitive is valid in any state where a local acknowledgment is not
pending.
.SH "NEW STATE"

.SH RESPONSE
This primitive requires the NS provider to generate one of the
following acknowledgments upon receipt of the primitive:
.IP \- 4
.B Successful:
