.SH NAME
.B SL_PDU_REQ, sl_pdu_req_t
\- protocol data unit request primitive
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
The PDU request service primitive consists of zero or one
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block and one
.BR M_DATA (9)
message block containing the message signal unit.  The structure of the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    sl_long sl_primitive;
    sl_ulong sl_mp;
} sl_pdu_req_t;
\s+1\fP
.fi
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The PDU request service primitive provides the SLS user with the ability to
request that a message signal unit be transmitted on an in-service signalling
link.
.\"
.SS Parameters
.PP
The PDU request service primitive contains the following parameters:
.TP
.I sl_primitive
Specifies the service primitive type.  Always
.BR SL_PDU_REQ .
.TP
.I sl_mp
Specifies the message priority for the message signal unit.  Message
priorities are provider-specific, but are typically between 0 and 3.  This
message priority field is only applicable to SS7 protocol variants that place
message priority bits in a field of the Level 2 header (TTC).
.\"
.SS State
.PP
This primitive is only valid in the
.B LMI_ENABLED
management state, and is valid from the
.B SL_STATE_IN_SERVICE
link state.
.\"
.SS "New State"
.PP
The management and link state remains unchanged.
.\"
.SS Modes
.PP
This primitive is issued in all modes.
.\"
.SS Originator
.PP
This primitive is issued by the SLS User.
.\"
.SS Rules
.PP
The following rules are observed when issuing the PDU request service primitive:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
The
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block is optional and is only necessary for the TTC SS7
protocol variant, or an SS7 protocol variant which places message priority
bits into the Level 2 header.
.IP \(em
The PDU request service primitive does not require a response from the SLS
provider.
.\"
.SS Response
.PP
The PDU request service primitive is not acknowledged.
