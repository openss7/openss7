.SH NAME
.PP
.B TC_CANCEL_IND
\- Operation Cancellation Indication
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
This message consists of one
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block formatted as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct TC_cancel_ind {
    ulong PRIM_type;          /* Always TC_CANCEL_REQ */
    ulong DIALOG_id;          /* Dialog Identifier */
    ulong INVOKE_id;          /* Invoke identifier */
} TC_cancel_ind_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This primitive indicates cancellation (timeout) of an operation.
.SH PARAMETERS
.PP
The fields of this message have the following meanings:
.TP 16
.I PRIM_type
is the primitive type.
Always
.BR TC_CANCEL_IND .
.TP
.I DIALOG_id
is the dialogue identifier to which the component will belong.
This must be the same as the
.I DIALOG_id
from the corresponding
.BR TC_INVOKE_REQ
primitive.
.TP
.I INVOKE_id
is the TC user assigned invocation identifier for this operation.
This must be the same as the
.I INVOKE_id
from the corresponding
.BR TC_INVOKE_REQ
primitive.
.SH RULES
.PP
The
.I DIALOG_id
and
.I INVOKE_id
is used by the TC user to correlate the cancellation to the invocation.
The
.I DIALOG_id
and
.I INVOKE_id
must be the same as those from the corresponding
.BR TC_INVOKE_REQ (7)
primitive.
.PP
Component handling indication primitives are issued after the corresponding Dialogue handling
primitives that indication reception of the following components.  See
.BR tci (7)
for more detail.
.SH MODES
.PP
Operation class 1 or 3.
.SH ORIGINATOR
.PP
TC user.
.SH FILES
.TP
.B <ss7/tc.h>
\- the transaction component interface header file.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
