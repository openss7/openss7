.SH NAME
.PP
.B TC_END_IND, TC_RESP_IND
\- Dialogue End Indication
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
This message consists of one
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block
followed by zero or more
.BR M_DATA (9)
blocks if any TC user data is associated with the primitive.
The format of the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block is as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct TC_end_ind {
    ulong PRIM_type;          /* Always TC_END_IND */
    ulong OPT_length;         /* Options associated with the primitive */
    ulong OPT_offset;         /* Options associated wtih the primitive */
    ulong DIALOG_id;          /* Dialog Identifier */
    ulong COMP_flags;         /* Components present flag */
} TC_end_ind_t;

typedef struct TC_end_ind TC_resp_ind_t;
\fR\s+1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This primitive indicates to the TC user that the user on the other side of the dialogue
is finished sending data.
.SH PARAMETERS
.PP
The fields of this message have the following meanings:
.TP 16
.I PRIM_type
identifies the primitive type.
.TP
.I OPT_length
is the length of the protocol options associated with the primitive and TC user data.
.TP
.I OPT_offset
is the offest from the beginning of the
.BR M_PROTO (9)
message block where the protocol options begin.
.TP
.I DIALOG_id
is the TC provider assigned dialogue identifier.
.TP
.I COMP_flags
are the component flags associated with the primitive.  Componet flags are TC provider specific.
.SH MODES
.PP
Operations class 1, 2, or 3.
.SH ORIGINATOR
.PP
TC provider.
.SH "FILES"
.TP
.B <ss7/tc.h>
