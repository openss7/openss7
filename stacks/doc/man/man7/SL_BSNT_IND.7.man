.SH NAME
.B SL_BSNT_IND, sl_bsnt_ind_t
\- backward sequence number tranmitted indication primitive
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
The BSNT indication service primitive consists of one
.BR M_PROTO "(9) or " M_PCPROTO (9)
message block, structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    sl_long sl_primitive;
    sl_ulong sl_bsnt;
} sl_bsnt_ind_t;
\s+1\fP
.fi
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The BSNT indication service primitive is originated by the SLS provider to
indicate the retrieved BSNT value in response to a
.BR SL_RETRIEVE_BSNT_REQ (7)
primitive from the SLS user.
.\"
.SS Parameters
.PP
The BSNT indication service primitive contains the following parameters:
.TP
.I sl_primitive
Indicates the service primitive type.  Always
.BR SL_BSNT_IND .
.TP
.I sl_bsnt
Indicates the value of the BSNT.  The format of the BSNT value is
provider-specific but is typically a 7-bit or 12-bit sequence number.
.\"
.SS State
.PP
This primitive is valid in management state
.B LMI_ENABLED
and link state
.BR SL_STATE_OUT_OF_SERVICE .
.\"
.SS "New State"
.PP
The new state remains unchanged.
.\"
.SS Modes
.PP
This primitive is issued in all modes.
.\"
.SS Originator
.PP
This primitive is issued by the SLS Provider.
.\"
.SS Rules
.PP
The SLS provider observes the following rules when issuing a BSNT indication
service primitive:
.IP \(em \w'\(em\(em'u
The primitive is only issued from the
.B LMI_ENABLED
management state and the
.B SL_STATE_OUT_OF_SERVICE
link state.
.IP \(em
The primitive is only issued in response to an outstanding
.BR SL_RETRIEVE_BSNT_REQ (7)
primitive when it is possible for the SLS provider to retrieve the BSNT value.
.\"
.SS Response
.PP
The primitive does not require a response from the SLS user.
