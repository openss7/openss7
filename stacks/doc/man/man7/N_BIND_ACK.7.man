.SH SYNOPSIS
Format The format of the message is one

message block, and its structure is the following:

typedef struct {
    ulong PRIM_type;            /* always N_BIND_ACK */
    ulong ADDR_length;          /* address length */
    ulong ADDR_offset;          /* offset of address */
    ulong CONIND_number;        /* connection indications */
    ulong TOKEN_value;          /* NC response token value */
    ulong PROTOID_length;       /* length of protocol id */
    ulong PROTOID_offset;       /* offset from beg. of block */

.SH DESCRIPTION
This primitive indicates to the NS user that the specified network user entity
has been bound to the requested network address and that the specified number
of connect indications are allowed to be queued by the NS provider for the
specified network address.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.I PRIM_type
Indicates the primitive type.

.TP
.I ADDR_length
Is the length of the network address that was bound.

.TP
.I ADDR_offset
Is the offset from the beginning of the
.B M_PCPROTO
block where the network address begins.

.TP
.I CONIND_number
Is the accepted number of connect indications allowed to be outstanding by the
NS provider for the specified network address.  If its value is zero, this
stream cannot accept
.BR N_CONN_IND (7)
messages.  If its value is greater than zero, then the NS user can accept
.BR N_CONN_IND (7)
messages up to the value specified in this parameter before having to respond
with a
.BR N_CONN_RES (7)
or a
.BR N_DISCON_REQ (7)
message.  This field should be ignored for CLNS.

.TP
.I TOKEN_value
Conveys the value of the "token" assigned to this stream that canbe used by
the NS user in a
.BR N_CONN_RES (7)
primitive to accept a NC on this stream.  It is a non-zero value, and is unique
to all streams bound to the NS provider.  This field should be ignored for
CLNS.

.TP
.I PROTOID_length
Conveys the length of the protocol ids that were bound.

.TP
.I PROTOID_offset
Conveys the offset of the protocol ids that were bound.  The proper alignment
of the address in the
.B M_PCPROTO
message block is not guaranteed.
.SH RULES
Bind Rules: The following rules apply to the binding of the specified network
address to the stream
.IP \- 4
If the
.I ADDR_length
field in the
.BR N_BIND_REQ (7)
primitive is zero, then the NS provider is to assign a network address to the
user.
.IP \-
The NS provider is to bind the network address as specified in the
.BR N_BIND_REQ (7)
primitive.  If the NS provider cannot bind the specified address, it may assign
another network address to the user.  It is the network user's responsibility
to check the network address returned in the
.B N_BIND_ACK
primitive to see if it is the same as the one requested.
.PP
The following rules apply to negotiating
.I CONIND_number
argument:
.IP \- 4
The
.I CONIND_number
in the
.B N_BIND_ACK
primitive must be less than or equal to the
corresponding requested number as indicated in the
.BR N_BIND_REQ (7)
primitive.
.IP \-
Only one stream that is bound to the indicated network address may have
a negotiated accepted number of maximum connect requests greater than zero.  If
a
.BR N_BIND_REQ (7)
primitive specifies a value greater than zero, but another stream
has already bound itself to the given network address with a value greater than
zero, the NS provider should assign another protocol address to the user.
.IP \-
If a stream with
.I CONIND_number
greater than zero is used to accept a connection, the stream will be found
busy during the duration of that connection and no other streams may be bound
to that network address with a
.I CONIND_number
greater than zero.  This will prevent more than one stream bound
to the identical network address from accepting connect indications.
.IP \-
A stream requesting a
.I CONIND_number
of zero should always be legal.  This indicates to the NS provider that the
stream is to be used to request connections only.
.IP \-
A stream with a negotiated
.I CONIND_number
greater than zero may generate connect requests or accept connect indications.
.SH RESPONSE
If the above rules result in an error condition, then the NS provider must
issue an
.BR N_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive to the NS user specifying the error as defined
in the description of the
.BR N_BIND_REQ (7)
primitive.
.SH STATE
This primitive is in response to a
.BR N_BIND_REQ (7)
primitive and is valid in the
state
.BR NS_WACK_BREQ .
.SH "NEW STATE"
The new state is
.BR NS_IDLE .
