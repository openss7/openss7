.SH NAME
.B DL_SUBS_BIND_ACK (dl_subs_bind_ack_t)
\- reports the succesful bind of a subsequent DLSAP to a stream, and
returns the bound DLSAP address to the DLS user.  This primitive is generated
in response to a
.BR DL_SUBS_BIND_REQ (7).
.SH SYNOPSIS
The message consists of one
.B M_PCPROTO
message block, which contains the following structure.
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    t_uscalar_t  dl_primitive;
