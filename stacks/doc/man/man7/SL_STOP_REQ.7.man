.SH NAME
.B SL_STOP_REQ, sl_stop_req_t
\- stop request primitive
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
The stop request service primitive consists of one
.BR M_PROTO "(9) or " M_PCPROTO (9)
message block, structured as follows:
.sp
.nf
\fC\s-1\
typedef struct {
    sl_long sl_primitive;
} sl_stop_req_t;
\s+1\fP
.fi
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The stop request primitive allows the SLS user to request that a signalling
link be brought out of service by the SLS provider.
.\"
.SS Parameters
.PP
The stop request service primitive contains the following parameters:
.TP
.I sl_primitive
Specifies the service primitive type.  Always
.BR SL_STOP_REQ .
.\"
.SS State
.PP
This primitive is only valid in management state
.BR LMI_ENABLED .
This primitive is valid in link state
.BR SL_STATE_INITIAL_ALIGNMENT ,
.BR SL_STATE_ALIGNED_READY ,
.BR SL_STATE_ALIGNED_NOT_READY " or
.BR SL_STATE_IN_SERVICE .
.\"
.SS "New State"
.PP
The new link state is
.BR SL_STATE_OUT_OF_SERVICE .
.\"
.SS Modes
.PP
This primitive is issued in all modes.
.\"
.SS Originator
.PP
This primitive is issued by the SLS User.
.\"
.SS Response
.PP
The stop request service primitive does not require receipt acknowledgement
from the SLS provider.
.IP \(en \w'\(en\(em'u
.B Successful:
When successful, the SLS provider does not need to acknowledge the stop
request service primitive.  The resulting link state is
.BR SL_STATE_OUT_OF_SERVICE .
.IP \(en
.B Unsuccessful (non-fatal errors):
When unsuccessful, the SLS provider negatively acknowledges the stop request
service primitive with a
.BR LMI_ERROR_ACK (7)
primitive containing the error and reason.  The resulting state is unchanged.
.PP
When the management state is
.BR LMI_ENABLED ,
but the link state is
.BR SL_STATE_POWER_OFF " or " SL_STATE_OUT_OF_SERVICE ,
the SLS provider should ignore the
.BR SL_STOP_REQ (7)
primitive and not generate a non-fatal error.
.\"
.SS Errors
.PP
.B Non-Fatal Errors:
applicable non-fatal errors are as follows:
.TP \w'\fBLMI_LAN_COLLISIONS\fR\(em'u
.B LMI_UNSPEC
Unknown or unspecified.
.PD 0
.TP
.B LMI_EVENT
Protocol-specific event occurred.
.TP
.B LMI_FATALERR
Device has become unusable.
.TP
.B LMI_OUTSTATE
Primitive was issued from invalid state.
.TP
.B LMI_PROTOSHORT
.BR M_PROTO (9)
block too short.
.TP
.B LMI_SYSERR
UNIX system error.
.TP
.B LMI_DEVERR
Start of device-specific error codes.
