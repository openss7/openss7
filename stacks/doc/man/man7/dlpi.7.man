.SH NAME
.B DLPI
\- Data Link Provider Interface
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/dlpi.h>
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\"
.\"
.\"
.\"
The data link layer (layer 2 in the OSI Reference Model) is responsible for
the transmission and error-free delivery of bits of information over a physical
communications medium.
.\"
.\"
.PP
The model of the data link layer is presented here to describe concepts that
are used throughout the specification of
.BR DLPI .
It is described in terms of an
interface architecture, as well as addressing concepts needed to identify
different components of that architecture.  The description of the model
assumes familiarity with the OSI Reference Model.
.\"
.\"
.PP
Each layer of the OSI Reference Model has two standards:
.\"
.\"
.IP \(bu 3
one that defines the services provided by the layer, and
.\"
.\"
.IP \(bu 3
one that defines the protocol through which layer services are provided.
.\"
.\"
.PP
.B DLPI
is an implementation of the first type of standard.  It specifies an
interface to the services of the data link layer.
.\"
.\"
.PP
The data link interface is the boundary between the network and data link
layers of the OSI Reference Model.  The network layer entity is the user of
the services of the data link interface (DLS user), and the data link layer
entity is the provider of those services (DLS provider).  This interface
consists of a set of primitives that provide access to the data link layer
services, plus the rules for using those primitives (state transition rules).
A data link interface service primitive might request a particular service or
indicate a pending event.
.\"
.\"
.PP
To provide uniformity among the various UNIX system networking products, an
effort is underway to develop service interfaces that map to the OSI Reference
Model.  A set of kernel-level interfaces, based on the
.IR STREAMS (4)
development environment, constitute a major portion of this effort.  The
service primitives that make up these interfaces are defined as
.IR STREAMS (4)
messages that are transferred between the user and provider of the service.
.B DLPI
is one such kernel-level interface, and is targeted for
.IR STREAMS (4)
protocol modules that either use or provide data link services.  In addition,
user programs that wish to access a
.IR STREAMS (4)-based
data link provider directly may do so using the
.BR putmsg(2) " and " getmsg (2)
system calls.
The DLS provider is configured as a
.IR STREAMS (4)
driver,and the DLS user accesses the provider using
.BR open (2)
to establish a stream to the DLS provider.  The stream acts as a communication
endpoint between a DLS user and the DLS provider.  After the stream is
created, the DLS user and DLS provider communicate via the messages presented
later in this specification.
.B DLPI
is intended to free data link users from specific knowledge of the
characteristics of the data link provider.  Specifically, the definition of
.B DLPI
hopes to achieve the goal of allowing a DLS user to be implemented independent
of a specific communications medium.  Any data link provider (supporting any
communications medium) that conforms to the
.B DLPI
specification may be substituted beneath the DLS user to provide the data link
services.  Support of a new DLS provider should not require any changes to the
implementation of the DLS user.
.\"
.\"
.PP
.\"
.\"
.SS "MODES OF COMMUNICATION"
The data link provider interface supports three modes of communication:
connection, connectionless and acknowledged connectionless.
.\"
.\"
.PP
The connection mode is circuit-oriented and enables data to be transferred
over a pre-established connection in a sequenced manner.  Data may be lost or
corrupted in this service mode, however, due to provider-initiated
resynchronization or connection aborts.
.\"
.\"
.PP
The connectionless mode is message-oriented and supports data transfer in
self-contained units with no logical relationship required between units.
Because there is no acknowledgment of each data unit transmission, this
service mode can be unreliable in the most general case.  However, a specific
DLS provider can provide assurance that messages will not be lost, duplicated,
or reordered.
.\"
.\"
.PP
The acknowledged connectionless mode provides the means by which a data link
user can send data and request the return of data at the same time.  Although
the exchange service is connectionless, in-sequence delivery is guaranteed for
data sent by the initiating station.  The data unit transfer is
point-to-point.
.\"
.\"
.PP
.B CONNECTION-MODE SERVICE
.\"
.\"
.PP
The connection-mode service is characterized by four phases of communication:
local management,connection establishment, data transfer, and connection
release.
.\"
.\"
.TP
.B Local Management
This phase enables a DLS user to initialize a stream for use in communication
and establish an identity with the DLS provider.
.\"
.\"
.TP
.B Connection Establishment
This phase enables two DLS users to establish a data link connection between
them to exchange data.  One user (the calling DLS user) initiates the
connection establishment procedures, while another user (the called DLS user)
waits for incoming connect requests.  The called DLS user is identified by an
address associated with its stream (as will be discussed shortly).
.sp
A called DLS user may either accept or deny a request for a data link
connection.  If the request is accepted, a connection is established between
the DLS users and they enter the data transfer phase.  For both the calling
and called DLS users, only one connection may be established per stream.
Thus, the stream is the communication endpoint for a data link connection.
The called DLS user may choose to accept a connection on the stream where it
received the connect request, or it may open a new stream to the DLS provider
and accept the connection on this new, responding stream.  By accepting the
connection on a separate stream, the initial stream can be designated as a
listening stream through which all connect requests will be processed.  As
each request arrives, a new stream (communication endpoint) can be opened to
handle the connection, enabling subsequent requests to be queued on a single
stream until they can be processed.
.\"
.\"
.TP
.B Data Transfer
In this phase, the DLS users are considered peers and may exchange data
simultaneously in both directions over an established data link connection.
Either DLS user may send data to its peer DLS user at any time.  Data sent by
a DLS user is guaranteed to be delivered to the remote user in the order in
which it was sent.
.\"
.\"
.TP
.B Connection Release
This phase enables either the DLS user, or the DLS provider, to break an
established connection.  The release procedure is considered abortive, so any
data that has not reached the destination user when the connection is released
may be discarded by the DLS provider.
.\"
.\"
.PP
.B CONNECTIONLESS-MODE SERVICE
.\"
.\"
.PP
The connectionless mode service does not use the connection establishment and
release phases of the connection-mode service.  The local management phase is
still required to initialize a stream.  Once initialized, however, the
connectionless data transfer phase is immediately entered.  Because there is
no established connection, however, the connectionless data transfer phase
requires the DLS user to identify the destination of each data unit to be
transferred.  The destination DLS user is identified by the address associated
with that user (as will be discussed shortly).
.\"
.\"
.PP
Connectionless data transfer does not guarantee that data units will be
delivered to the destination user in the order in which they were sent.
Furthermore, it does not guarantee that a given data unit will reach the
destination DLS user, although a given DLS provider may provide assurance that
data will not be lost.
.\"
.\"
.PP
.B ACKNOWLEDGED CONNECTIONLESS-MODE SERVICE
.\"
.\"
.PP
The acknowledged connectionless mode service also does not use the connection
establishment and release phases of the connection-mode service.  The local
management phase is still required to initialize a stream.  Once initialized,
the acknowledged connectionless data transfer phase is immediately entered.
Acknowledged connectionless data transfer guarantees that data units will be
delivered to the destination user in the order in which they were sent.  A
data link user entity can send a data unit to the destination DLS User,
request a previously prepared data unit from the destination DLS User, or
exchange data units.
.\"
.\"
.SS "DLPI ADDRESSING"
Each user of
.B DLPI
must establish an identity to communicate with other data link users.  This
identity consists of two pieces.  First, the DLS user must somehow identify
the physical medium over which it will communicate.  This is particularly
evident on systems that are attached to multiple physical media.  Second, the
DLS user must register itself with the DLS provider so that the provider can
deliver protocol data units destined for that user.
.\"
.\"
.PP
.B PHYSICAL ATTACHMENT IDENTIFICATION
.\"
.\"
.PP
The physical point of attachment (PPA) is the point at which a system attaches
itself to a physical communications medium.  All communication on that
physical medium funnels through the PPA.
.\"
.\"
.PP
On systems where a DLS provider supports more than one physical medium, the
DLS user must identify which medium it will communicate through.  A PPA is
identified by a unique PPA identifier.  For media that support physical layer
multiplexing of multiple channels over a single physical medium (such as the B
and D channels of ISDN), the PPA identifier must identify the specific channel
over which communication will occur.
.\"
.\"
.PP
Two styles of DLS provider are defined by
.BR DLPI ,
distinguished by the way they enable a DLS user to choose a particular PPA.
The style 1 provider assigns a PPA based on the major/minor device the DLS
user opened.  One possible implementation of a style 1 driver would reserve a
major device for each PPA the data link driver would support.  This would
allow the
.IR STREAMS (4)
clone open feature to be used for each PPA configured.  This style of provider
is appropriate when few PPAs will be supported.
.\"
.\"
.PP
If the number of PPAs a DLS provider will support is large, a style 2 provider
implementation is more suitable.  The style 2 provider requires a DLS user to
explicitly identify the desired PPA using a special attach service primitive.
For a style 2 driver, the open(2) creates a stream between the DLS user and
DLS provider, and the attach primitive then associates a particular PPA with
that stream.  The format of the PPA identifier is specific to the DLS
provider, and should be described in the provider-specific addendum
documentation. 
.B DLPI
provides a mechanism to get and/or modify the physical address.  The
primitives to handle these functions are described in Appendix A.  The
physical address value can be modified in a post-attached state.  This would
modify the value for all streams for that provider for a particular PPA.  The
physical address cannot be modified if even a single stream for that PPA is in
the bound state.
.\"
.\"
.PP
The DLS User uses the supported primitives
.RB ( DL_ATTACH_REQ (7),
.BR DL_BIND_REQ (7),
.BR DL_ENABMULTI_REQ (7),
.BR DL_PROMISCON_REQ (7))
to define a set of enabled physical and SAP address components on a per Stream
basis.  It is invalid for a DLS Provider to ever send upstream a data message
for which the DLS User on that stream has not requested.  The burden is on the
provider to enforce by any means that it chooses, the isolation of SAP and
physical address space effects on a per-stream basis.
.\"
.\"
.PP
.B DATA LINK USER IDENTIFICATION
.\"
.\"
.PP
A data link user's identity is established by associating it with a data link
service access point (DLSAP),which is the point through which the user will
communicate with the data link provider.  A DLSAP is identified by a DLSAP
address.  The DLSAP address identifies a particular data link service access
point that is associated with a stream(communication endpoint).  A bind
service primitive enables a DLS user to either choose a specific DLSAP by
specifying its DLSAP address, or to determine the DLSAP associated with a
stream by retrieving the bound DLSAP address.  This DLSAP address can then be
used by other DLS users to access a specific DLS user.  The format of the
DLSAP address is specific to the DLS provider, and should be described in the
provider-specific addendum documentation.  However,
.B DLPI
provides a mechanism for decomposing the DLSAP address into component pieces.
The
.BR DL_INFO_ACK (7)
primitive returns the length of the SAP component of the DLSAP address, along
with the total length of the DLSAP address.  Certain DLS Providers require the
capability of binding on multiple DLSAP addresses.  This can be achieved
through subsequent binding of DLSAP addresses.
.B DLPI
supports peer and hierarchical binding of DLSAPs.  When the User requests peer
addressing, the DLSAP specified in a subsequent bind may be used in lieu of
the DLSAP bound in the
.BR DL_BIND_REQ (7).
This will allow for a choice to be made between a number of DLSAPs on a stream
when determining traffic based on DLSAP values.  An example of this would be
to specify various ether_type values as DLSAPs.  The
.BR DL_BIND_REQ (7),
for example, could be issued with ether_type value of IP, and a subsequent
bind could be issued with ether type value of ARP.  The Provider may now
multiplex off of the ether_type field and allow for either IP or ARP traffic
to be sent up this stream.  When the DLS User requests hierarchical binding,
the subsequent bind will specify a DLSAP that will be used in addition to the
DLSAP bound using a
.BR DL_BIND_REQ (7).
This will allow additional information to be specified, that will be used in a
header or used for de-multiplexing.  An example of this would be to use
hierarchical bind to specify the OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier) to
be used by SNAP.
.\"
.\"
.SS "THE CONNECTION MANAGEMENT STREAM"
The earlier description of the connection-mode service assumed that a DLS user
bound a DLSAP to the stream it would use to receive connect requests.  In some
instances, however, it is expected that a given service may be accessed
through any one of several DLSAPs.  To handle this scenario, a separate stream
would be required for each possible destination DLSAP, regardless of whether
any DLS user actually requested a connection to that DLSAP.  Obvious resource
problems can result in this scenario.  To obviate the need for tying up system
resources for all possible destination DLSAPs, a "connection management
stream" utility is defined in
.BR DLPI .
A connection management stream is one that receives any connect requests that
are not destined for currently bound DLSAPs capable of receiving connect
indications.  With this mechanism, a special listener can handle incoming
connect requests intended for a set of DLSAPs by opening a connection
management stream to the DLS provider that will retrieve all connect requests
arriving through a particular PPA.  In the model, then, there may be a
connection management stream per PPA.
.\"
.\"
.SS "DLPI SERVICES"
The various features of the
.B DLPI
interface are defined in terms of the services provided by the DLS provider,
and the individual primitives that may flow between the DLS user and DLS
provider.
.\"
.\"
.PP
The data link provider interface supports three modes of service: connection,
connectionless and acknowledged connectionless.  The connection mode is
circuit-oriented and enables data to be transferred over an established
connection in a sequenced manner.  The connectionless mode is message-oriented
and supports data transfer in self-contained units with no logical
relationship required between units.  The acknowledged connectionless mode is
message-oriented and guarantees that data units will be delivered to the
destination user in the order in which they were sent.  This specification
also defines a set of local management functions that apply to all modes of
service.  The XID and TEST services that are supported by
.B DLPI
are listed below.  The DLS User can issue an XID or TEST request to the DLS
Provider.  The Provider will transmit an XID or TEST frame to the peer DLS
Provider.  On receiving a response, the DLS Provider sends a confirmation
primitive to the DLS User.  On receiving an XID or TEST frame from the peer
DLS Provider, the local DLS Provider sends up an XID or TEST indication
primitive to the DLS User.  The User must respond with an XID or TEST response
frame to the Provider.
.\"
.\"
.\"
.\"
.\"
.SS "Local Management Services"
.PP
The local management services apply to the connection, connectionless and
acknowledged connectionless modes of transmission.  These services, which fall
outside the scope of standards specifications, define the method for
initializing a stream that is connected to a DLS provider.  DLS provider
information reporting services are also supported by the local management
facilities.
.PP
.B Information Reporting Service
.RS 4
This service provides information about the
.B DLPI
stream to the DLS user.  The
message
.BR DL_INFO_REQ (7)
requests the DLS provider to return operating information about the stream.
The DLS provider returns the information in a
.BR DL_INFO_ACK (7)
message.
.RE
.PP
.B Attach Service
.RS 4
The attach service assigns a physical point of attachment (PPA) to a stream.
This service is required for style 2 DLS providers (see section 2.3.1,
Physical Attachment Identification) to specify the physical medium over which
communication will occur.  The DLS provider indicates success with a
.BR DL_OK_ACK (7);
failure with a
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7).
.PP
A PPA may be disassociated with a stream using the
.BR DL_DETACH_REQ (7).
.RE
.PP
.B Bind Service
.RS 4
The bind service associates a data link service access point (DLSAP) with a
stream.  The DLSAP is identified by a DLSAP address. 
.BR DL_BIND_REQ (7)
requests that the DLS provider bind a DLSAP to a stream.  It also notifies the
DLS provider to make the stream active with respect to the DLSAP for
processing connectionless and acknowledged connectionless data transfer and
connection establishment requests.  Protocol-specifications taken during
activation should be described in DLS provider-specific addenda.  The DLS
provider indicates success with a
.BR DL_BIND_ACK (7);
failure with a
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7).
.PP
Certain DLS providers require the capability of binding on multiple DLSAP
addresses. 
.BR DL_SUBS_BIND_REQ (7)
provides that added capability.  The DLS provider indicates success with a
.BR DL_SUBS_BIND_ACK (7);
failure with a
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7).
.PP
.BR DL_UNBIND_REQ (7)
requests the DLS provider to unbind all DLSAP(s) from a stream.  The
.BR DL_UNBIND_REQ (7)
also unbinds all the subsequently bound DLSAPs that have not been unbound.
The DLS provider indicates success with a
.BR DL_OK_ACK (7);
failure with a
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7).
.PP
.BR DL_SUBS_UNBIND_REQ
requests the DLS Provider to unbind the subsequently bound DLSAP.  The DLS
Provider indicates success with a
.BR DL_OK_ACK (7);
failure with a
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7).
.PP
.BR DL_ENABMULTI_REQ
requests the DLS Provider to enable specific multicast addresses on a per
stream basis.  The Provider indicates success with a
.BR DL_OK_ACK (7);
failure with a
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7).
.PP
.BR DL_DISABMULTI_REQ
requests the DLS Provider to disable specific multicast addresses on a per
Stream basis.  The Provider indicates success with a
.BR DL_OK_ACK (7);
failure with a
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7).
.PP
.BR DL_PROMISCON_REQ
requests the DLS Provider to enable promiscuous mode on a per Stream basis,
either at the physical level or at the SAP level.  The Provider indicates
success with a
.BR DL_OK_ACK (7);
failure with a
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7).
.PP
.BR DL_PROMISCOFF_REQ
requests the DLS Provider to disable promiscuous mode on a per Stream
basis,either at the physical level or at the SAP level.  The Provider
indicates success with a
.BR DL_OK_ACK (7);
failure with a
.BR DL_ERROR_ACK (7).
.RE
.SS "Connection-mode Services"
.PP
The connection-mode services enable a DLS user to establish a data link
connection, transfer data over that connection, reset the link, and release
the connection when the conversation has terminated.
.PP
.B Connection Establishment Service
.RS 4
The connection establishment service establishes a data link connection
between a local DLS user and a remote DLS user for the purpose of sending
data.  Only one data link connection is allowed on each stream.
.PP
.B Normal Connection Establishment
.PP
In the connection establishment model, the calling DLS user initiates
connection establishment, while the called DLS user waits for incoming
requests. 
.BR DL_CONNECT_REQ (7)
requests that the DLS provider establish a connection. 
.BR DL_CONNECT_IND (7)
informs the called DLS user of the request, which
may be accepted using
.BR DL_CONNECT_RES (7).
.BR DL_CONNECT_CON (7)
informs the calling DLS user that the connection has been established.
.PP
Once the connection is established, the DLS users may exchange user data using
.BR DL_DATA_REQ (7)
and
.BR DL_DATA_IND (7).
.PP
The DLS user may accept an incoming connect request on either the stream where
the connect indication arrived or an alternate, responding stream.  The
responding stream is indicated by a token in the
.BR DL_CONNECT_RES (7).
This token is a value associated with the responding stream, and is obtained
by issuing a
.BR DL_TOKEN_REQ (7)
on that stream.  The DLS provider responds to this request by generating a
token for the stream and returning it to the DLS user in a
.BR DL_TOKEN_ACK (7).
.PP
In the typical connection establishment scenario, the called DLS user
processes one connect indication at a time, accepting the connection on
another stream.  Once the user responds to the current connect indication, the
next connect indication (if any) can be processed.
.B DLPI
also enables the called DLS user to multi-thread incoming connect indications.
The user can receive multiple connect indications before responding to any of
them.  This enables the DLS user to establish priority schemes on incoming
connect requests.
.PP
.B Connection Establishment Rejections
.PP
In certain situations, the connection establishment request cannot be
completed.  The following paragraphs describe the occasions under which
.BR DL_DISCONNECT_REQ (7)
and
.BR DL_DISCONNECT_IND (7)
primitives will flow during connection establishment, causing the connect
request to be aborted.
.PP
Where the DLS provider rejects a connect request for lack of resources or
other reason, the DLS provider sends
.BR DL_DISCONNECT_IND (7)
in response to
.BR DL_CONNECT_REQ (7).
.PP
Where the calling DLS user chooses to abort a previous connection attempt, the
DLS user issues
.BR DL_DISCONNECT_REQ (7)
at some point following a
.BR DL_CONNECT_REQ (7).
The resulting sequence of primitives depends on the relative timing of the
primitives involved.
.RE
.PP
.B Data Transfer Service
.RS 4
The connection-mode data transfer service provides for the exchange of user
data in either direction or inboth directions simultaneously between DLS
users.  Data is transmitted in logical groups called data link service data
units (DLSDUs).  The DLS provider preserves both the sequence and boundaries
of DLSDUs as they are transmitted.
.PP
Normal data transfer is neither acknowledged nor confirmed.  It is up to the
DLS users, if they so choose,to implement a confirmation protocol.  Each
.BR DL_DATA_REQ (7)
primitive conveys a DLSDU from the local DLS user to the DLS provider.
Similarly, each
.BR DL_DATA_IND (7)
primitive conveys a DLSDU from the DLS provider to the remote DLS user.
.RE
.PP
.B Connection Release Service
.RS 4
The connection release service provides for the DLS users or the DLS provider
to initiate the connection release.  Connection release is an abortive
operation, and any data in transit (has not been delivered to the DLS user)
may be discarded.
.BR DL_DISCONNECT_REQ (7)
requests that a connection be released.
.BR DL_DISCONNECT_IND (7)
informs the DLS user that a connection has been released.  Normally, one DLS
user requests disconnection and the DLS provider issues an indication of the
ensuing release to the other DLS user.
.RE
.PP
.B Reset Service
.RS 4
The reset service may be used by the DLS user to resynchronize the use of a
data link connection, or by the DLS provider to report detected loss of data
unrecoverable within the data link service.
.PP
Invocation of the reset service will unblock the flow of DLSDUs if the data
link connection is congested;DLSDUs may be discarded by the DLS provider.  The
DLS user or users that did not invoke the reset will be notified that a reset
has occurred.  A reset may require a recovery procedure to be performed by the
DLS users.
.PP
The interaction between each DLS user and the DLS provider will be one of the
following:
.IP \(em 4
a
.BR DL_RESET_REQ (7)
from the DLS user, followed by a
.BR DL_RESET_CON (7)
from the DLS
provider;
.IP \(em 4
a
.BR DL_RESET_IND (7)
from the DLS provider, followed by a
.BR DL_RESET_RES (7)
from the
DLS user.  The
.BR DL_RESET_REQ (7)
acts as a synchronization mark in the stream of
DLSDUs that are transmitted by the issuing DLS user;
.IP \(em 4
the
.BR DL_RESET_IND (7)
acts as a synchronization mark in the stream of DLSDUs that are received by
the peer DLS user.  Similarly, the
.BR DL_RESET_RES (7)
acts as a synchronization mark in the stream of DLSDUs that are transmitted by
the responding DLS user; the
.BR DL_RESET_CON (7)
acts as a synchronization mark in the stream of DLSDUs that are received by
the DLS user which originally issued the reset.
.PP
The resynchronizing properties of the reset service are that:
.IP \(em 4
No DLSDU transmitted by the DLS user before the synchronization mark in that
transmitted stream will be delivered to the other DLS user after the
synchronization mark in that received stream.
.IP \(em 4
The DLS provider will discard all DLSDUs submitted before the issuing of the
.BR DL_RESET_REQ (7)
that have not been delivered to the peer DLS user when the DLS provider issues
the
.BR DL_RESET_IND (7).
.IP \(em 4
The DLS provider will discard all DLSDUs submitted before the issuing of the
.BR DL_RESET_RES (7)
that have not been delivered to the initiator of the
.BR DL_RESET_REQ (7)
when the DLS provider issues the
.BR DL_RESET_CON (7).
.IP \(em 4
No DLSDU transmitted by a DLS user after the synchronization mark in that
transmitted stream will be delivered to the other DLS user before the
synchronization mark in that received stream.
.PP
The complete message flow depends on the origin of the reset, which may be the
DLS provider or either DLS user.
.RE
.SS "Connectionless-mode Services"
The connectionless-mode services enable a DLS user to transfer units of data
to peer DLS users without incurring the overhead of establishing and releasing
a connection.  The connectionless service does not, however, guarantee
reliable delivery of data units between peer DLS users (e.g. lack of flow
control may cause buffer resource shortages that result in data being
discarded).
.PP
Once a stream has been initialized via the local management services, it may
be used to send and receive connectionless data units.
.PP
.B Connectionless Data Transfer Service
.RS 4
The connectionless data transfer service provides for the exchange of user
data (DLSDUs) in either direction or in both directions simultaneously without
having to establish a data link connection.  Data transfer is neither
acknowledged nor confirmed, and there is no end-to-end flow control provided.
As such, the connectionless data transfer service cannot guarantee reliable
delivery of data.  However, a specific DLS provider can provide assurance that
messages will not be lost, duplicated, or reordered. 
.BR DL_UNITDATA_REQ (7)
conveys one DLSDU to the DLS provider.
.BR DL_UNITDATA_IND (7)
conveys one DLSDU to the DLS user.
.RE
.PP
.B QOS Management Service
.RS 4
The QOS (Quality of Service) management service enables a DLS user to specify
the quality of service it can expect for each invocation of the connectionless
data transfer service.  The
.BR DL_UDQOS_REQ (7)
directs the DLS provider to set the QOS parameters to the specified values.
.RE
.PP
.B Error Reporting Service
.RS 4
The connectionless-mode error reporting service may be used to notify a DLS
user that a previously sent data unit either produced an error or could not be
delivered.  This service does not, however, guarantee that an error indication
will be issued for every undeliverable data unit.
.RE
.PP
.B XID and TEST Service
.RS 4
The XID and TEST service enables the DLS User to issue an XID or TEST request
to the DLS Provider.  On receiving a response for the XID or TEST frame
transmitted to the peer DLS Provider, the DLS Provider sends up an XID or TEST
confirmation primitive to the DLS User.  On receiving an XID or TEST frame
from the peer DLS Provider, the local DLS Provider sends up an XID or TEST
indication respectively to the DLS User.  The DLS User must respond with an
XID or TEST response primitive.  If the DLS User requested automatic handling
of the XID or TEST response, at bind time, the DLS Provider will send up an
error acknowledgment on receiving an XID or TEST request.  Also, no
indications will be generated to the DLS User on receiving XID or TEST frames
from the remote side.
.RE
.SS "Acknowledged Connectionless-mode Services"
The acknowledged connectionless-mode services are designed for general use for
the reliable transfer of informations between peer DLS Users.  These services
are intended for applications that require acknowledgment of cross-LAN data
unit transfer, but wish to avoid the complexity that is viewed as being
associated with the connection-mode services.  Although the exchange service
is connectionless, in sequence delivery is guaranteed for data sent by the
initiating station.
.PP
.B Acknowledged Connectionless-mode Data Transfer Services
.RS 4
The acknowledged connectionless-mode data transfer services provide the means
by which the DLS Users can exchange DLSDUs which are acknowledged at the LLC
sublayer, without the establishment of a Data Link connection.  The services
provide a means by which a local DLS User can send a data unit to the peer DLS
User, request a previously prepared data unit, or exchange data units with the
peer DLS User.
.RE
.PP
.B QOS Management Service
.RS 4
The Quality of Service (QOS) management service enables a DLS User to specify
the quality of service it can expect for each invocation of the acknowledged
connectionless data transfer service.  The
.BR DL_UDQOS_REQ (7)
directs the DLS provider to set the QOS parameters to the specified values.
The normal flow of messages is illustrated in section 3.3.2, (Connectionless
mode services).
.RE
.PP
.B Error Reporting Service
.RS 4
The acknowledged connectionless mode error reporting service is the same as
the unacknowledged connectionless-mode error reporting service.  For the
message flow, refer to section 3.3.3.
