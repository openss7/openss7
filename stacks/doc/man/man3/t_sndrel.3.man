.TH T_SNDREL 3 "$Date: 2004/04/17 21:26:01 $" "$Name:  $" "OpenSS7 XTI/TLI Library"
.SH NAME
.B t_sndrel
\- send orderly release
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B #include <xti.h>
.HP 8
.BI "int t_sndrel(int " fd );
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
.TP
.I fd
the transport endpoint to release in an orderly fashion.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR t_sndrel ()
requests that the transport connection be released in an orderly fashion.
.PP
.I fd
specifies the local transport endpoint.
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
.BR t_sndrel ()
is only valid in state
.BR T_DATAXFER " or " T_INREL .
.PP
.BR t_sndrel ()
is only valid for transport service providers of service type
.BR T_COTS_ORD .
.PP
In synchronous mode,
.BR t_sndrel ()
blocks until there is sufficient room to buffer the message for transmission
considering flow control.
In asynchronous mode where there is insufficient room to buffer the orderly
release request considering flow control,
.BR t_sndrel ()
fails, returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to
.RB [ TFLOW ].
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
Upon success,
.BR t_sndrel ()
returns zero (0).
Upon failure,
.BR t_sndrel ()
returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
When
.BR t_sndrel ()
fails, it returns -1 and sets
.IR t_errno (3)
to an appropriate error number as follows:
.TP \w'[TNOTSUPPORT]\(em'u
.RB [ TBADF ]
.I fd
is invalid.
.TP
.RB [ TFLOW ]
The call would block due to flow control and
.I fd
is in asynchronous mode
.BR "" ( O_NONBLOCK " or " O_NDELAY
was set using
.BR t_open "(3) or " fcntl (2).
.TP
.RB [ TLOOK ]
An asynchronous event occured before the call could complete.  See \fBt_look\fR(3) for more information.
.TP
.RB [ TNOTSUPPORT ]
The call requires the use of a TPI primitive not supported by the underlying transport provider.
This can occur when the transport service provider service type is
.BR T_CLTS " or " T_COTS .
.TP
.RB [ TOUTSTATE ]
The call was issued with the interface in a state other than
.BR T_DATAXFER " or " T_INREL .
.TP
.RB [ TPROTO ]
A protocol error occured between the XTI/TLI library and the underlying transport provider.
.TP
.RB [ TSYSERR ]
A \fBLinux\fR system error occured and the \fBLinux\fR error number is set in \fIerrno\fR(3).
