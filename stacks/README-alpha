This software is alpha software.  As such, it will likely crash your kernel.
Installation of the software may irreparably mangle your header files or Linux
distribution in such a way as to make it unusable.  Crashes will likely lock
your system and rebooting the system might not repair the problem.  You can
loose all the data on your system.  Because this software can crash your kernel,
the resulting unstable system could destroy computer hardware or peripherals
making them unusable.  You will likely void the warranty on any system on which
you run this software. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
