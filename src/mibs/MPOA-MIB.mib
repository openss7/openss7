    DESCRIPTION
	 "This object contains an appropriate value to
	 be used for mpcIndex when creating entries in
	 the mpcConfigTable.  The value 0 indicates that
	 no new rows can be created.  Otherwise, it is
	 recommended that values are assigned contiguously,
	 starting from 1.

	 MPC creation by a Manager:  To obtain the mpcIndex value
	 for a new entry, the manager issues a management protocol
	 retrieval operation to obtain the current value of this
	 object.  If the value retrieved is 0 (zero), the manager
	 cannot create a row.

	 After each retrieval of a non-zero value, the manager
	 should issue a management protocol SET operation using
	 the value just retrieved.  If the SET is successful,
	 the agent should update the value to the next unassigned
	 index, or zero if appropriate.

	 NOTE:  the manager may also issue a set on this object
	 with a value of its own choosing.  If the set is successful,
	 the manager may use this value for the mpcIndex. In this
	 case, the agent would update the value to the next
	 unassigned index, or zero if appropriate.
	 The definition of `next unassigned index' is any
	 mpcNextIndex value that has not yet been set by a manager,
	 or reserved by the agent (see next paragraph), since this
	 agent was last re-initialized.

	 MPC creation by an Agent:  When a row in the
	 mpcConfigTable is created by an agent, the agent should
	 reserve the value of the index by updating the value of
	 this object to the next unassigned index
	 or zero if appropriate.  Thus, a manager will not
	 be able to set an index reserved by an agent.

	 In the situation of an agent re-initialization,  all currently
	 used mpcIndexes must be preserved.
	 In other words, the Agent should store in non-volatile memory
	 all of the currently used mpcIndexes (along with all necessary
	 configuration information from the mpcConfigTable).  When the
	 agent is re-initialized, the mpcNextIndex value is
	 any valid Integer32 value which is not being used
	 as an mpcIndex, except 0 which maintains its original
	 definition of indicating that a row cannot be created."

    STATUS    current
    DESCRIPTION
	 "This object contains an appropriate value to
	 be used for mpsIndex when creating entries in
	 the mpsConfigTable.  The value 0 indicates that
	 no new rows can be created.  Otherwise, it is
	 recommended that values are assigned contiguously,
	 starting from 1.

	 MPS creation by a Manager:  To obtain the mpsIndex
	 value for a new entry, the manager issues a management
	 protocol retrieval operation to obtain the current value
	 of this object.  If the value retrieved is 0 (zero), the
	 manager cannot create a row.


	 After each retrieval of a non-zero value, the manager
	 should issue a management protocol SET operation using
	 the value just retrieved.  If the SET is successful,
	 the agent should update the value to the next
	 unassigned index, or zero if appropriate.

	 NOTE:  the manager may also issue a set on this object
	 with a value of its own choosing.  If the set is successful,
	 the manager may use this value for the mpsIndex. In this
	 case, the agent would update the value to the next
	 unassigned index, or zero if appropriate.
	 The definition of `next unassigned index' is any
	 mpsNextIndex value that has not yet been set by a
	 manager, or reserved by the agent (see next paragraph),
	 since this agent was last re-initialized.

	 MPS creation by an Agent:  When a row in the mpsConfigTable is
	 created by an agent, the agent should reserve the value of
	 the index by updating the value of this object to
	 the next unassigned index or zero if appropriate.  Thus, a
	 manager will not be able to set an index reserved by an agent.
	 In the situation of an agent re-initialization all currently
	 used mpsIndexes must be preserved.  In other words, the Agent
	 should store in non-volatile memory  all the currently used
	 mpsIndexes (along with all necessary configuration information
	 from the mpsConfigTable).  When the agent is re-initialized,
	 the mpsNextIndex value is any valid Integer32 which is not
	 being used as an mpsIndex, except 0 which maintains its
	 original definition of indicating that a row cannot be created."
