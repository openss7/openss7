  Abstract

  The MTP3-User Adaptation Layer is a protocol for the transport of any SS7
  MTP3-User signalling (e.g., ISUP and SCCP messages) over IP using the
  services of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol. Also, provision is
  made for protocol elements that enable a seamless operation of the MTP3-
  User peers in the SS7 and IP domains. This protocol would be used between
  a Signalling Gateway (SG) and a Media Gateway Controller (MGC) or IP-
  resident Database. It is assumed that the SG receives SS7 signaling over
  a standard SS7 interface using the SS7 Message Transfer Part (MTP) to
  provide transport.

  Internet Draft            M3UA MIB using SMIv2              August, 2004




     Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
     the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are generally
     accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
     Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
     Structure of Management Information (SMI). This memo specifies a MIB
     module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
     RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
     [RFC2580].


  3.  Structure of the MIB

     The MIB is structured in the following way:


     MIB-2 {1 3 6 1 2 1}
       |
       +--(xxxx)m3uaMib
            |

                    +--(2) m3uaSgpIpspCompliance



     where the following sections are described :

     o m3uaManagement, where all the objects to manage M3UA are defined
       under this branch.

       - m3uaAttributes: where general attributes values are placed. It is
         divided in:

         ∏ m3uaConfig: where the general M3UA configuration parameters are
           listed.

         ∏ m3uaStatistics: where general Statistics for M3UA are listed.

       - m3uaTables: where specific attributes for each element that can be
         defined and used to manage a M3UA Based System. Every table is
         structured in the following way:

                      m3uaScopeTablename
                           |
                          / \
              m3uaScopeCfg   m3uaScopeStat

       These tables hold data for:

        - Asp: Tables that are implemented in ASP Agents.

        - SgpIpsp: Tables that are implemented in both SGP and IPSP Agents.

        - Gen: Tables implemented in all ASP, SGP and IPSP Agents.

     o m3uaConformance, for the Unit of Conformance.

       - m3uaGroups: M3UA MIB variables have been grouped according to
         their functionality and the context they belong to.

       - m3uaCompliances: minimal list of objects in the M3UA MIB module
         that an agent developer must implement.


  3.1  Management

  3.1.1  Attributes

  3.1.1.1 Protocol General Variables

     The first section of the MIB contains the general variables of the
     M3UA protocol. Maximum, minimum and initial values can be found here.

  3.1.1.2 Protocol General Statistics

     Statistics included here relate to the whole M3UA layer. Statistics
     per  association are defined inside specific association tables.

  3.1.2  ASP Tables

     All the tables included within this branch, are tables to be located
     in the ASP node. These tables will show remote (SGP) or local (ASP)
     nodes parameters.

     The tables have been divided into Configuration Tables (Cfg) and
     Statistic Tables (Stat).

  3.1.2.1 Destination Table

     The destination table is composed of all the parameters needed to find
     the right SG to reach the SS7 destination. The addressing parameters
     that are needed are: Network Appearance (NA) that univocally reference
     the network where the message is sent, and Destination Point Code
     (DPC), which is the final address in the SS7 domain.

     Each final destination within the SS7 domain can be reached through
     one or more Signaling Gateways (SGs). The state of the destination may
     be different for each SG and AS pairs.

     The result of this table would be the final destination state. An SS7
     node may be available, unavailable, congested, restricted or unknown.
     There may be certain cases where its state is unknown, e.g. after
     initialization.

     From an ASP point of view, an SGP can be reached using the association
     established to it. This table allows to know the identification for
     the association to a concrete SGP as well as the SCTP streams
     constraints imposed by M3UA to the lower layer.

  3.1.3  SGP/IPSP Tables

     All the tables included within this branch are tables to be located in
     the SGP or IPSP node. These tables will show remote (ASP/IPSP) node
     parameters.

     The tables have been divided into Configuration Tables (Cfg) and
     Statistics Tables (Stat).


  3.1.3.1 Routing Table

     The Routing table contains a list of routing keys, which translate to
     an Application Server ID and a corresponding Routing Context.

     As a Routing Key may be composed of any combination of basic SS7
     routing elements, if an element is not included in the routing key, a
     default value is assigned. This default value can continue being
     considered as an indexing value itself.

  6. Security Considerations

     SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if security
     measures are taken (e.g., using IPSEC), there is no per-user control
     as to who (once an IPSEC association is established between hosts) is
     allowed to GET or SET the objects in this MIB

     It is recommended that the implementers consider the security features
     as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use of the
     User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View-based Access
     Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended.

     It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
     entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
     configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
     (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
     (change/create/delete) them.

     o mib-2 suggested as branch for mib.

     o m3uaAppSpEpState consistently defined as INTEGER.

     o m3uaPeerAppTrafficMode consistently defined as INTEGER.

     o Fixed error in m3uaSpEpEntry object description text.

     o Rework in m3uaAppType object description text.


  9.5 Changes from draft rev 02 to draft rev 03:

     o Value range of m3uaAppTrafficMode object is modified.

     o Object m3uaLocalPort is changed to "read-write". A comment
       is added with the recommended IANA port number.

     o Object m3uaFailOverBuffering is deleted. A comment in object
       m3uaTrValue is added: If Tr is 0 then FailOver Buffering is Off.
       Thus, there is no further need for this element.

     o Object m3uaMaxPeerApplications is deleted.

     o InetAddressType for local and remote IP addresses:

     Limit UNKNOWN type only for unknown IP address format. Remove UNKNOWN
     type for zero-length value in the InetAddress since it will be never
     zero-length due to the size restriction (0..64)

     Addition of the ipv4z an ipv6z types for non-globally IP addresses in
     which a scope identifier is needed. Addition of the scope of ipv6
     type.
     All of them according to the RFC2851update-v04

     o Conformance:

     Description: Specify that the M3UA MIB only need to support IPv4/IPv6
     addresses without a zone index, unknown type and DNS names. Support
     for
     IPv4/IPv6 addresses without zone indices is not required.

     InetAddressType of local and remote IP address: Clarify the
     implementation is only required to support IPv4 and IPv6 address types
     without zone indices. Clarify also that UNKONWN type is only used in
     case of local and remote addresses when invalid/unknown IP address
     format.
