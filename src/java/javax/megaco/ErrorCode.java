   response events from stack. These error codes would help the
   application in identifying the granularity of the error occured.

   This would occur if for example Modify command response event is sent
   to stack for ADD command request.

          Identifies a ErrorCode object that constructs the class with
          the constant M_MISSING_REMOTE_TPT_ADDR. Since it is reference
          to static final object, it prevents further instantiation of
          the same object in the system.

  MISSING_SVC_CHNG_REASON

public static final ErrorCode MISSING_SVC_CHNG_REASON
        = new ErrorCode(M_MISSING_SVC_CHNG_REASON);

          Identifies a ErrorCode object that constructs the class with
          the constant M_MISSING_SVC_CHNG_REASON. Since it is reference
          to static final object, it prevents further instantiation of
          the same object in the system.

  MISSING_SVC_CHNG_METHOD

public static final ErrorCode MISSING_SVC_CHNG_METHOD
        = new ErrorCode(M_MISSING_SVC_CHNG_METHOD);

          Identifies a ErrorCode object that constructs the class with
          the constant M_MISSING_SVC_CHNG_METHOD. Since it is reference
          to static final object, it prevents further instantiation of
          the same object in the system.

  MISSING_ENC_FORMAT

public static final ErrorCode MISSING_ENC_FORMAT
        = new ErrorCode(M_MISSING_ENC_FORMAT);

          Identifies a ErrorCode object that constructs the class with
          the constant M_MISSING_ENC_FORMAT. Since it is reference to
          static final object, it prevents further instantiation of the
          same object in the system.

  TPT_ADDR_ALREADY_INUSE

public static final ErrorCode TPT_ADDR_ALREADY_INUSE
        = new ErrorCode(M_TPT_ADDR_ALREADY_INUSE);

          Identifies a ErrorCode object that constructs the class with
          the constant M_TPT_ADDR_ALREADY_INUSE. Since it is reference to
          static final object, it prevents further instantiation of the
          same object in the system.

   Constructor Detail

  ErrorCode

private ErrorCode(int error_code)

          Constructs an abstract class that specifies the error code in
          the command.

   Method Detail

  getErrorCode

public int getErrorCode()

          This method returns one of the static field constants defined
          in this class. This method is overriden by the derived class,
          which shall return an hard coded value depending on the class.


        Returns:
                Returns an integer value that identifies the error code
                to be one of the constant values defined for this class.
     _________________________________________________________________

  getObject

public static final ErrorCode getObject(int value)
                throws IllegalArgumentException()

          Returns reference of the ErrorCode object that identifies the
          termination type as value passed to this method.


                Parameters:
                          value - It is one of the possible values of the
                static constant that this class provides.

        Returns:
                Returns reference of the ErrorCode object.

        throws:
                IllegalArgumentException() - If the value passed to this
                method is invalid, then this exception is raised.
     _________________________________________________________________

  readResolve

private java.lang.Object readResolve()

        This method must be implemented to perform instance substitution
   during serialization. This method is required for reference
   comparison. This method if not implimented will simply fail each time
   we compare an Enumeration value against a de-serialized Enumeration
   instance.
