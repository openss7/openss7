   public class ExceptionInfoCode
   extends java.lang.Object

   The ExceptionInfoCode class defines the contants for the associated
   info code whenever a exception is raised. The info code would assist
   the application in debugging the cause of exception, whenever it is
   raised. Most the the info codes specified in this class are for the
   IllegalArgumentException raised when a invalid argument is passed to a
   method.

   is invalid as per the protocol.
   static int M_INV_MTP3B_ADDR_FORMAT
              Identifies that the MTP3b Address string passed to the
   method is invalid as per what has been defined by the class.
   static int M_INV_AAL5_ADDR_FORMAT
              Identifies that the AAL5 Address string passed to the

   contains incorrect or incomplete information.
   static int M_INV_ERROR_CODE
              Identifies that the error code object reference is not
   valid for the class for which it is being set. For example
   CreateAssocResp class should return error code corresponding to
   CreateAssocReq only. If any othen error code is set, then exception is
   raised with this info code.

   Method Detail

  getExceptionInfoCode

public int getExceptionInfoCode()

          This method returns one of the static field constants defined
          in this class. This method is overriden by the derived class,
          which shall return an hard coded value depending on the class.


        Returns:
                Returns an integer value that identifies the exception
                info code to be one of one of the constant values defined
                for this class.

                Parameters:
                          value - It is one of the possible values of the
                static constant that this class provides.

        Returns:
                Returns reference of the ExceptionInfoCode object.

        throws:
                IllegalArgumentException() - If the value passed to this
                method is invalid, then this exception is raised.

  readResolve

private java.lang.Object readResolve()

        This method must be implemented to perform instance substitution
   during serialization. This method is required for reference
   comparison. This method if not implimented will simply fail each time
   we compare an Enumeration value against a de-serialized Enumeration
   instance.
