.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B MX-PMOD
is an simulation of a local multipelex control for devices conforming to the to the
.BR mxi (7)
interface.
.B MX-PMOD
provides for the control of the matrix and underlying interfaces and communications facilities.
.PP
.B MX-PMOD
is implemented as a STREAMS pushable module.
.B MX-PMOD
can be pushed over one end of a STREAMS-based
.BR pipe (4).
The result is two Streams, each corresponding to the file descriptor returned for each end of the
pipe, each presenting the Multiplex Interface (MXI) to MX User Streams above.  The result is a
simulated, connected group carrier.
.PP
.B MX-PMOD
Streams, from both sides, can be linked under a
.BR ch (4)
or
.BR mx (4)
multiplexing driver to provide a complete switching matrix.  In this way, facilities based drivers
can be emulated internal to a single host.  Quite complex configurations are possible.
.\"
.\"
.SH USAGE
.PP
The
.B MX-PMOD
module is used as follows:
.IP 1. \w'0.\(em'u
Open a STREAMS-based pipe using the
.BR pipe (2s)
library call from the STREAMS library.
.IP 2.
Push the
.I \(lqmx-pmod\(rq
module over one end of the pipe.  There is no need to push
.BR pipemod (4)
as the
.B MX-PMOD
module properly reverses the send of flush bits across the pipe twist when it is pushed directly
over a pipe end.
.IP 3.
Configure the multiplex on each end of the pipe using the MX input-output controls described in
.BR mxi_ioctl (4)
and used normally with MX device drivers.
.IP 4.
Link the MX Streams under CH or MX multiplexing drivers in the same fashion as other MX driver
Streams.
.\"
.\"
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
The service interface provided on each file descriptor of the STREAMS-based pipe is the Multiplex
Interface (MXI) described in
.BR mxi (7).
.\"
.\"
.SH ADDRESSES
.PP
The
.B MX-PMOD
presents a
.I Style 1
device, in that it is implicitly associated with a Physical Point of Attachment; therefore,
.B MX-PMOD
does not require a Physical Point of Attachment addressing scheme.
.\"
.\"
.SH IOCTLS
The
.B MX-PMOD
provides the same set of input-output controls that are provided for standard MX Streams, as
described in
.BR mxi_ioctl (4).
.\"
.\"
.SH NOTICES
.PP
The
.BR ch (4)
and
.BR mx (4)
have been implemented as multiplexing drivers to ease the development of matrix switching drivers
for various cards.  All that is required is transparent access to a group facility and the
implementation of the simplistic Multiplex Interface (MXI) and it is possible to link Streams under
the
.BR ch (4)
and
.BR mx (4)
multiplexing drivers to form a complete switching matrix with channelized access and multiplex
capabilities.  To facilitate testing of the
.BR ch (4)
and
.BR mx (4)
multiplexing drivers, both the
.BR ch-pmod (4)
and
.B MX-PMOD
modules were developed to permit tranforming STREAMS-based pipes into a connected group carrier or
channel facility.  This permits controlled testing of the multiplexing drivers that make up the
remainder of the switching matrix without using a real driver.
.PP
Therefore, one of the primary purposes of this module was for using STREAMS-based pipes to test the
other multiplexing drivers
.RB ( ch "(4) and " mx "(4))
with the Stream linked.
.\"
.\"
.SH IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
.B MX-PMOD
is implemented internally as a wrapper around a STREAMS-based pipe.
.PP
.B MX-PMOD
does not implement a syncrhonous facilitiy in the same manner as a real driver:
.B MX-PMOD
simply passes data blocks through the STREAMS-based pipe.  To avoid usurping all of the system's
resources on passing idle bits through the emulated facility, a throttlin technique is used to limit
the bandwidth of the pipe to emulate a synchronous facility.  The throttling technique uses an
interval and a timer.  If the number of frames passed during the interval exceeds the throttle rate,
the pipe is stalled and the timer set.  The pipe is then restarted when the timer expires.  By
proper choice of the threshold and the timer, the effective bandwidth can be limited to an arbitrary
limit.  The effective bandwidth can be selected by setting the bandwidth of the facility using MX
input-output controls, as described in
.BR mxi_ioctl (4).
