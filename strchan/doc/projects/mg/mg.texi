@node Executive Overview
@unnumbered Executive Overview

This document provides a @value{MANUAL_TYPE} for the @value{MANUAL_TITLE}.
The initial and primary purpose of this equipment is to provide a scalable, carrier-grade platform
for terminating TDM voice circuits from the PSTN and providing Media Gatway capabilities for those
terminated circuits.  The purpose is both one of @dfn{hard switching}, where circuits are directly
connected, as well as @dfn{soft switching}, where circuits are converted to RTP sessions and passed
to another Media Gateway.

@subsubheading The OpenSS7 Project

The @uref{http://www.openss7.org/, OpenSS7 Project} is an open source software project that has
developed many protocol components within the SS7, SIGTRAN, ISDN and VoIP protocol stacks.
Intellectual property rights for the OpenSS7 Project are held by @uref{http://www.openss7.com/,
OpenSS7 Corporation}.  All OpenSS7 Project software is eventually licensed under the GNU Affero General Public
License Version 3.  OpenSS7 Corporation also provides commercial licensing of OpenSS7 Project
software under terms less restrictive than the AGPL.

@subsubheading OpenSS7 Media Gateway (MG) Platform

OpenSS7 can provide VoIP gateway capabilities in a high-performance, low-cost, small-footprint
platform leaveraging the GNU/Linux operating system distributions and tools, and utilizing low-cost
commodity, or high-quality standardized hardware.

For details on platform applications, see @ref{Application Architecture}, @ref{Network
Architecture}, @ref{Optional Application Support}, and @ref{Optional Network Support}.

@subsubheading Open Source Software

The OpenSS7 Project leverages the widespread use of GNU/Linux operation systems, distributions, and
FSF tools such as @samp{autoconf} and @dfn{RPM}.  For example, this document was formatted for PDF,
HTML, info and plain text using the GNU @dfn{texinfo} system, @samp{autoconf}, and the @TeX{}
formatting system.

The open source model avoids proprietary lock-in and permits in-house or outsourced development.
All source code is available for use and modification by the end customer.  All build tools,
documentation and associated resources are generally available.  The availability of the source code
and complete documentation eases problem resolution and can offer upgrades and fixes even in advance
of client problem reports.  

For details on software solutions, see @ref{Protocol Architecture}, @ref{Software Architecture},
@ref{Optional Protocol Support}, and @ref{Optional Software Support}.

@subsubheading Commodity Hardware

By best utilizing commodity PC or standardized CompactPCI hardware, OpenSS7 makes available the
highest performance platforms available on the market at back-to-school prices.  When carrier-grade
and large scale is not essential, 3GHz Pentium class servers in hardened rack mount chassis can be
used at a fraction of the cost, and yet outperform, other solutions.  Where carrier-grade is
necessary, embedded Linux on standardized PICMG 2.16 NEBS compliant chassis make for a higher cost,
but more reliable alternative.

For details on hardware solutions, see @ref{Platform Architecture}, @ref{Hardware Architecture},
and @ref{Optional Hardware Support}.

@subsubheading Integrated Management

Utilizing open source management tools, such as @command{net-snmp} and @command{OSIMIS}, OpenSS7
protocol stacks provide integrated management support for SNMPv2c, SNMPv3, or CMISE/CMIP.  The
entire platform, from alarms to provisioning, can be provided using integrated SNMP agents.

For details on management solutions, see @ref{Platform Architecture}, @ref{Management Architecture},
and @ref{Optional Management Support}.

@subsubheading Rapid Development

The OpenSS7 Project has already developed protocol components completing the SS7 and SIGTRAN
signalling stacks including MTP Level 2 and Level 3, ISUP, SCCP, TCAP; and SCTP, M2PA, M2UA, M3UA,
SUA and TUA.  Development of a Carrier VoIP Switch to meet initial field requirements needs only the
development of some intermediate and auxillary modules.

For details on scheduling, see @ref{Logistics}.

@subsubheading An Evolving Solution

The OpenSS7 Project is evolving to support more protocol stacks including ISDN and VoIP.  Support
for an ever expanding capability is demonstrated by the additional options available as described in
@ref{Optional Application Support}, @ref{Optional Network Support},
@ref{Optional Protocol Support}, @ref{Optional Software Support},
and @ref{Optional Hardware Support}.

@subsubheading Conclusions

In summary, an OpenSS7 Carrier VoIP Switch an excellent application of the OpenSS7 SS7 and VoIP stacks and
can be provided at a affordable price on short time-lines, while offering an evolution path for
future deployment applications.

@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction
@cindex Introduction

This document provides a @value{MANUAL_TYPE} for a platform to provide the @value{MANUAL_TITLE}
capabilities.  The primary driver for the @value{MANUAL_TITLE} is to provide a system capable of
interconnecting a VoIP backbone to the PSTN using SS7.  This document provide a high-level design
and proposal for a production system to provide this capability at a number of scale points.

The proposal utilizes, where possible, existing OpenSS7 protocol stack components and provides a
development plan for components that are specific to the @value{MANUAL_TITLE} initial requirements.

This document discusses the resulting software configuration that will be put in place on the
production system, the platform configuration for the production system, and a network configuration
for deployment.  Also discussed is an overview of the project management logistics for successful
completion over the course of this development project.

It is intended that this document be a ``living'' document, that is updated over the course of this
development project.

@section The OpenSS7 Media Gateway
@cindex The OpenSS7 Media Gateway

This project provides an @value{MANUAL_TITLE} that provides interconnection to the PSTN using TDM
circuits and is capable of routng call to and from the PSTN and a VoIP backbone network using
@dfn{hard switching}, physical circuit switching, or @dfn{soft switching}, RTP transport.

@node Project Drivers
@section Project Drivers
@cindex Project drivers

The lead purpose of the @value{MANUAL_TITLE} is to provide PSTN interconnection to an existing VoIP
backbone deployment infrastructure that lacks same.

@node Scope
@section Scope
@cindex Scope

Because the focus on low cost, high performance, and production stability, the @value{MANUAL_TITLE}
is constructed using commodity computing platforms and PCI based hardware cards, but using hardenned
NEBS-3/ETSI compliant chasses in an active/standby failover configuration.  This will result in a
cost-effective carrier grade system for mid- to low deployment cost.

Because of early deployment drivers yet requirements for scale, the @value{MANUAL_TITLE} platform is
constructed using standardized PICMG 2.16 telephony hardware in a NEBS 3/ETSI compliant chassis
providing carrier-grade serviceability and reliability.  Non-carrier-grade platforms utilizing
commodity PC hardware for lower scale installations are possible.

@cindex Project phases

The longer term project is broken into the following phases:

@table @dfn
@item Phase 1
The initial phase of the project is intended to provide the capabilities of the
@value{MANUAL_TITLE} operation for the deployment platform.
@item Phase 2
The second phase of the project is intended on performing SS7 signalling interoperability testing
for live deployment of the signalling gateway production platform.
@item Phase 3
The third phase of the project is to integrate the deployment platform with the OpenSS7 VoIP Switch
using the Internet Protocol suite.
@item Phase 4
The fourth phase of the project is to perform interoperability testing and a field trial of the
deployment platform.
@item Phase 5
The fifth phase of the project is to complete management system integration for remote monitoring
and provisioning for production service.
@end table

@node Gates
@subsection Gates
@cindex Project gates

Each phase of the project consists of seven gates.  The seven gates are defined as follows:

@table @dfn

@item Gate 0 --- Concept

@dfn{Gate 0} is passed when the initial concept has been elucidated and work is begun on a
High-Level Design.  This is an internal OpenSS7 gate.

@item Gate 1 --- High Level Design

@dfn{Gate 1} is passed when the high-level design has been reviewed to the satisfaction of the
consumers of the project.  This is an external review gate.  OpenSS7 internally passes this gate
once the High-Level Design has been published and work is begun on a detailed design.@footnote{This
document is a @value{MANUAL_TYPE} document and it meets the internal requirements for passing Gate 1
of Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the project.  An external review of this document by a Beta or Gamma
client or sponsor is pending.}

@item Gate 2 --- Detailed Design

@dfn{Gate 2} is passed when the detailed design has been reviewed to the satisfaction of the
consumers of the project and the developers on the project.  This is an external as well as an
internal review gate.  OpenSS7 passes this gate once the Detailed Design has been published and work
has begun on development and implementation of the design.@footnote{OpenSS7 requires a contractual
commitment for purchase from a Beta or Gamma client, or funding from a Sponsor of the OpenSS7
Project, before this gate can be passed and development started.} Passing this gate moves from the
design stage to the development stage of the project.

@item Gate 3 --- Deployment and Implementation

@dfn{Gate 3} is passed when the software and systems development and implementation to the detailed
design is complete and testing has begun.  This is an internal review gate.  OpenSS7 internally
passes this gate when software is code complete and hardware has been installed for testing.

@item Gate 4 --- System Test

@dfn{Gate 4} is passed once the product implementation meets all internal ad hoc and formal
conformance test suites and internal testing is complete.  This is an internal review gate.  OpenSS7
passes this gate internally once conformance testing is complete.  Passing this gate moves from the
development stage to the support stage of the project.

@item Gate 5 --- Acceptance Test

@dfn{Gate 5} is passed once the product implementation has passed external Gamma client acceptance
testing.  This is an external review gate.  OpenSS7 passes this gate internally once participation
in external acceptance testing is complete.

@item Gate 6 --- Project Complete

@dfn{Gate 6} is passed once all support obligations for the product implementation have been
discharged.  This is an internal review gate.  OpenSS7 passes this gate once support agreements have
terminated.

@section Solution Architecture
@cindex Solution architecture

Although the functions of @dfn{Media Gateway Controller}, @dfn{Media Gateway} and @dfn{Signalling
Gateway} have been decomposed, and in the past these functional groups have been implemented on
separate physical platforms, modern compute capacity and densities permit these functions to be
integrated into a single physical platform without limitation.  Open standard interfaces are
utilized internal to the platform to permit a decomposed model to be split out and to permit ETSI
Tiphon Version 4 compatibility as well as Multi-Services Forum Version 2 compatibility.

@subsection @value{MANUAL_TITLE} for Deployment

In light of the foregoing, the solution architecture takes the form of an integrated media gateway
capable of providing a number of functional groups in the traditional models.  The
@value{MANUAL_TITLE} integrates the following functional groups while still permitting standard
interfaces to be exposed for maximum deployment flexibility:

Signalling is via a path typically separate from the MG.  In the illustration in @figref{3.1}, the
signalling is via external STPs that are attached to switching complex Signalling Gateways (SGs)
that communicate with the Media Gateway Controller.  In some arrangements, the MG is possibly
also a Signalling Gateway.

@figuresized{netarch2,3.2,Network Architecture,5.5in}

@figref{3.2} illustrates the placement of the Media Gateway (MG) within the decomposed Service
Switching Point and its connection to Media Gateway Controllers within the switching complex as well
as to Service Switching Points (SSPs) in the external network.  As illustrated, the MG terminates
media gateway control messaging from the Media Gateway Controller (MGC) and attaches to external
network SSPs using TDM voice trunks.

@subsection ETSI TIPHON Entities

The ETSI TIPHON model illustrated in @figref{2.1} contains the following reference entities:

@table @dfn
@item Terminal:
The H.323, SIP or MEGACO @dfn{Terminal} support the @var{A} or @var{B} interface.  The @var{A}
interface is used for communicating with an H.323 @dfn{Gatekeeper}; SIP Forwarding Server, Proxy
Server or User Agent.

@dfn{Terminal} devices are external to the NG switching complex.  In initial phases, @dfn{Terminal}
device interface @var{A} (@pxref{Reference Interface A}) will only be supported via external H.323
Gatekeepers; SIP Forwarding Server or SIP Proxy Server.  Direct @dfn{Terminal} device attachment for
H.323, SIP and H.248 @dfn{Terminals} will be supported in later phases.

@item Gatekeeper:
The H.323 @dfn{Gatekeeper}, SIP Forwarding Server, or SIP Proxy Server, supports the @var{A},
@var{C}, @var{D} and @var{G} interfaces.

The NG switching complex will support an internal @dfn{Gatekeeper} function that will intially
support the @var{D} and @var{C} interfaces, and will support the @var{A} interface in later phases.
Intitially the @var{G} interface will be internal to the platform, and will be exposed in later phases.

In the NG switching complex, the @dfn{Gatekeeper} performs the role of a call-by-call server (and is
termed the CBC) which performance access authorization, routing and other functions on a call by
call basis, for FGD, H.323 and SIP calls.

@item Media Gateway Controller:
The H.323 or SIP @dfn{Media Gateway Controller} supports the @var{C}, @var{F}, @var{J} and @var{N}
interfaces.  The NG swtiching complex will incorporate an integral @dfn{Media Gateway Controller}
function.  In the field deployment the @var{C}, @var{F}, @var{J} and @var{N} interfaces will be
exposed.

The SIP @dfn{Media Gateway Controller} is primarily responsible for conversion of SCN signalling
from the PSTN on the @var{J} interface to VoIP signalling tot he SIP Redirect/Proxy server on the
@var{C} interface.  Also, the SIP MGC must coordinate this conversion with the control of media
conversion from G.703/704 G.711 A- and mu-law circtuis from the PSTN to RTP/RTCP channels within
the VoIP network.

@item Media Gateway:

@item Signalling Gateway:

@item Back End:

@item Session Border Controller:
The @dfn{Session Border Controller} is not illustrated in the ETSI TIPHON illustration, @figref{2.1}.

In essesnce a @dfn{Session Border Controller} is a security devices but may also be a protocol
conversion device.  The @dfn{Session Border Controller} sits on the @var{A}, @var{B} or @var{D}
interfaces, when those interfaces span an administrative, security or protocol domain.

The OpenSS7 SS7 and SIGTRAN stacks are implemented using the @dfn{STREAMS} facility.  Protocol
moduels within the stack are implemented as @dfn{STREAMS} modules, device drivers, multiplexing
drivers and pseudo-device drivers.  The @dfn{STREAMS} facility has the ability to stack modules and
multiplexing drivers above read or pseudo-device drivers using the @dfn{STREAMS} @manref{I_PUSH(7)}
an @manref{I_LINK(7)} facilities.  Since @dfn{STREAMS} modules and drivers run within the context of
the Operating System Kernel using message-based scheduling, greatly increased performance is
experienced over equivalent user-space applications.  @dfn{STREAMS} modules and drivers communicate
by passing priority.  In addition, @dfn{STREAMS} provides memory management, timer, locking,
syncrhonization, flow control and other facilities commonly used by protocol modules.

@figuresized{osimap,7.1,SS7 to ISO/OSI Mapping,}

Each OpenSS7 protocol module provides standardized X/Open ISO/OSI interfaces as well as more SS7

@item The configuration shown supports up to 288 low-speed (56 or 64 kbps) signalling links or up to
12 high-speed (1.544 Mpbs) signalling links.
@item Compute nodes communicate with each other over the IP network, either via local switch or
remote router, using M2UA.  This SIGTRAN protocol permits the compute node to logically share their
